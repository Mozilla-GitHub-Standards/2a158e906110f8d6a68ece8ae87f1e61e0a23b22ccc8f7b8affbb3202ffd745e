 <h1>tinderbox</h1>
 <h2>Motivation</h2>
 <p>If you get more than 10 developers together without tools, there is
  going to be an explosion.  Tinderbox keeps this potentially explosive
  situation under control.
 <p>Essentially, Tinderbox is a detective tool. It allows you to see
  what is happening in the source tree.  It shows you who checked in
  what (by asking <a href="bonsai.html">Bonsai</a>); what platforms have
  built successfully; what platforms are broken and exactly how they are
  broken (the build logs); and the state of the files that made up the
  build (cvsblame) so you can figure out who broke the build, so you can
  do the most important thing, <em>hold them accountable for their
  actions</em>.
 <h2>Design/Docs</h2>
 <p>Tinderbox is comprised of a server with a bunch of clients running
  builds and reporting status via mail.
 <dl>
  <dt>Server
  <dd>
   <p>The server recieves mail from tinderbox clients in the form of
   <pre>tinderbox: tree: SeaMonkey
tinderbox: builddate: 1021331520
(...)
tinderbox: status: success
tinderbox: END
(full build log)</pre>
   <p>The server then constructs a table with time on the vertical axis
    and the various builds on the horizontal axis.
   <dl>
    <dt>1.0 Server, original code
    <dd>Original code is checked in at
     <code>mozilla/webtools/tinderbox</code> a bit of a mess.  Many
     mozilla.org and Netscape-isms hard-coded here.  Main mozilla.org
     pages still use the 1.0 code, we are in the process of
     installing/evaluating the 2.0 server.
    <dt>2.0 Server, rewrite.
    <dd><a href="mailto:kestes@walrus.com">Ken Estes</a> graciously
     rewrote the 1.0 server code and has started a document
     <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tinderbox/">here</a>.
     Code is checked in at <code>mozilla/webtools/tinderbox2</code>.
     Things that happened here: lots of code cleanup, cleaner
     interfaces, less hard-coded dependencies, protocol abstractions,
     things like that. Possibly most-importantly the new 2.0 code does
     not necessarily need bonsai. Because both servers are coexisting
     for a while, this new server has been named "tinderbox2" for now.
   </dl>
  <dt>Client
  <dd>
   <p>The client is basically an infinite perl while loop that updates,
    builds, tests the build, and reports status as a mail to the server.
   <dl>
    <dt>1.0 Client, original code
    <dd>The 1.0 client sends two mails each cycle, a <q>I'm starting a
     build</q> message, and a <q>I'm done, here's the log and build
     status</q> message. Code is checked in at
     <code>mozilla/tools/tinderbox</code>. See the <code>README</code>
     and <code>examples</code> directories there for more info about
     how to set a client up. All of mozilla.org build machines currently
     use this client, or some form of it.  Also note, the client
     optionally loads post-mozilla.pl as a mechanism for building a
     branded or embedded client instead of the SeaMonkey build.
    <dt>2.0 Client.
    <dd>There is a new 2.0 client, the 2.0 server can also receive
     <q>build still going, partial log</q> messages so you can get
     progress as a build is going instead of having to wait until the
     end of the client loop.  1.0 client does not currently send any
     partial logs like this.<br>
   </dl>
 </dl>
 <p>Client/server protocol (log headers, described above) was made
  backwards compatible for the 2.0 server, so a 1.0 client can talk to
  either server.
 <h2>Mozilla.org usage of tinderbox</h2>
 <p>Here are some Mozilla projects using Tinderbox. The complete list
  of mozilla tinderbox pages is at
  <a href="http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/">tinderbox.mozilla.org</a>.
 <dl>
  <dt><a href="http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=SeaMonkey">SeaMonkey</a>
  <dd>This is our main tinderbox page. SeaMonkey is the project name
   for the latest incarnation of the mozilla browser. It uses
   NGLayout (raptor) and the new front end code (xpfe). These
   tinderbox machines live both in and outside of Netscape.
  <dt><a href="http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=SeaMonkey-Ports">SeaMonkey-Ports</a>
  <dd>This shows the status of the build on minor platforms,
   platforms we can't cover on the main page,
   <abbr title="et cetera">etc</abbr>.
 </dl>
 <p>The rules of development for Mozilla are as follows:
 <ul>
  <li>If there are any flaming builds, you can't check in code
   except to fix the build.
  <li>If you check in code, you must watch the builds until they are
   green on all platforms.
  <li>You can't check in and hope it works or plan to have someone else
   fix it. You should be very surprised if a build breaks.
  <li>Get help with platforms you don't have access to before checking in
   changes. Don't checkin if you aren't sure it will build on all
   platforms.
  <li>If you break these rules too often you won't be allowed to check
   in anymore. We're serious.
  <li>If you break the tree, and someone has to come after you to fix it,
   you owe that someone a bribe of their choice.  The traditional bribe to
   the release team has been tequila (but absolutely no Jose Cuervo.)
   Cookies and donuts make adequate substitutions.
 </ul>
 <h2>Tinderbox Server User Interface <abbr>FAQ</abbr></h2>
 <dl>
  <dt>How does this work?
  <dd>When you check in code, your name will appear in the
   <strong class="stronger">guilty</strong> column. When there are successful
   (green) builds in <em>all</em> columns in a row higher than your name,
   you know you are ok: you did not break the build.
  <dt>The tree is broken, how do I find out what's wrong?
  <dd>Clicking <kbd>L</kbd> in the first red box above a green box (that is,
   the first build to break) will show you a build log for the broken
   build. You can also click <kbd>C</kbd> in this box to see exactly what
   code was checked in since the previous build.
  <dt>The tree is on fire, and it's not my fault, and I would like to
   get some work done. What do I do?
  <dd>One thing you can do is check your <abbr>CVS</abbr> tree by date: look
   backward in the Tinderbox log until you see green. Note the time at which
   the tree built correctly.  Update your tree as it was at that date
   (with the <kbd>cvs update -D <var>date</var></kbd> option.) That should
   get you a build that works. (However, you won't be able to check in until
   the tree is again green.)
  <dt>What do "Clbr" and "Dep" mean?
  <dd>Clbr = Clobber, Dep = Depend. Mozilla.org tinderbox is hurting for
   horizontal space and we are just saving space here. "Clobber" builds are
   checked out and compiled from scratch. "Depend" builds are updated and
   rebuilt in the same directory, and incrementally rebuilt. (Depend builds
   tend to have a faster cycle time, but fail occasionally if the dependency
   mechanism fails.)
  <dt>You build on platforms Foo, Bar, and Baz, but my favorite platform
   is Quux, will you build on that too?
  <dd>Sure.  All you have to do is donate us a machine, and we'll add it to
   the list! Contact <a href="mailto:build@mozilla.org">build@mozilla.org</A> for
   information on setting up your own external tinderbox.
