<P><B><LI>Party?  What party?</B>

  <P> Read the <A HREF="flyer.html"><B>flyer</B></A>.

<P><B><LI> So you're throwing a party, and there will be two cool bands
there, and you're not charging admission, and in attendance will be many
attractive members of the appropriate sex for whatever my perverted taste 
is, and the drinks are free?
</B>

  <P> You have to pay for the drinks.  Don't be a cheapskate.

<P><B><LI> What's so great about open source code that it deserves a party?
</B>

  <P> Don't worry about that.  It's a party.  If you need to know the
  answer to that question, ask someone there.

<P><B><LI> You say the bands are cool, but I have... uh... been inside for
   a while, and I haven't heard of them yet.  What are they like?
</B>

  <P> In their own words:

  <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=8 CELLSPACING=0>

  Chances are you haven't seen anything like either of them, so come early
  and stay late if you know what's good for you!  (Consider this a 30% upgrade
  to your lame taste.)

<P><B><LI> The invitation says that the venue is 21+.  I'm not yet 21, 
  but I <I>am</I> really cute and possibly sexually promiscuous.  
  Can I come?
</B>

  <P> If you're sexually promiscuous, then you presumably know the answer
  to that question.

  <P> Seriously, what part of <B><I>21+</I></B> don't you understand?

<P><B><LI> Will you go out of your way to help me get to the party?  
  I live in Iceland and my rowboat has a hole in it.
</B>

  <P> We'll help you from the sidewalk to the door (and the reverse,
  should you become a drunken nuisance.)  Anything else is your
  responsibility.

<P><B><LI>Am I actually invited?  I'm very insecure, and so this isn't
  totally clear to me yet.
</B>

  <P> Yes, you're invited!  And if you've contributed to the 
  <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/"><B>Mozilla</B></A> project, then you
  also get in for <I>free</I>!  Oh wait, I forgot, everyone gets in for 
  free.  Nevermind, then.

<P><B><LI> I'm a member of the press, and I find the thought of being
surrounded by Netscape employees and other members of the Open Source 
community intriguing, especially considering that they will have had
their inhibitions quashed by alcohol.
</B>

  <P> Hi.  I like your boots.

<P><B><LI>Who's DJing?</B>

  <P> We will have two separate sound systems for your listening and dancing
  pleasure, under the musical guidance of:

  <P><UL>
    <LI><A HREF="mailto:evil@davidbowie.com"><B>Sage</B></A> of <B>Bedlam</B>
        and <A HREF="http://www.clubslick.com/"><B>Slick</B></A>;
    <LI><A HREF="http://www.milk.com/home/danfuzz/"><B>Fuzzboy</B></A>
	of <A HREF="http://www.milk.com/"><B>milk.com</B></A>;
    <LI><A HREF="mailto:Mephisto@thematrix.com"><B>Mephisto</B></A>

        <A HREF="http://www.thematrix.com/seventhsin/"><B>Seventh Sin</B></A>;
  </UL>

  <P>and I can promise you that you will <I>not</I> be hearing that damned
  Prince song, if you know what I mean and I think you do.

<P><B><LI>How do I get there?</B>

  <P> By learning how to follow
  <A HREF="directions.html"><B>directions</B></A>.

<P><B><LI>Questions?  Comments?  Suggestions?</B>

  <P> Bug <A HREF="mailto:jwz@mozilla.org?subject=mozilla dot party"><B>jwz@mozilla.org</B></A>,
    it's all his fault.
