<P><LI><B>Party?  What party?</B>

  <P> Read the <A HREF="flyer.html"><B>flyer</B></A>.

<P><B><LI> Wow, so you finally shipped the damned thing?  Awesome!</B>

  <P> Yeah, we're pretty excited.

<P><LI> <B>So you're throwing a party, and you're not charging
admission, and in attendance will be many attractive members of the
appropriate sex for whatever my perverted taste is, and the drinks are
free?  </B>

  <P> You have to pay for the drinks.  Don't be a cheapskate.

<P><LI> <B>The invitation says that the venue is 21+.  I'm not yet 21
but I'm important and smart and angry!  Damn the man!  Damn the
man!</B>

  <P> Fight the power, kid.  But the sad truth of San Francisco's
  liquor laws is that there is no way for a bar to ever allow any
  customer in who is under 21, ever, even if they were to choose not to
  serve alcohol that night.  Nightclubs and concert halls that are 18+
  are technically <I>restaurants</I>: they have kitchens and serve
  dinner.  DNA Lounge doesn't have a kitchen, so it's technically a
  bar, and just because you're old enough to vote and kill, you're not
  old enough to enter a bar.  Sorry, that's how it is.  You can read
  all about the permit mess on the

  <A HREF="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/permits.html">DNA
  Lounge</A> site.

  <P> ID is required for everybody, no matter how old you look
  (driver's license, passport, etc.)

<P><LI> <B>Will you go out of your way to help me get to the party?  
  I live in Iceland and my rowboat has a hole in it.
</B>

  <P> We'll help you from the sidewalk to the door (and the reverse,
  should you become a drunken nuisance.)  Anything else is your
  responsibility.

  <P> You can always watch from home!  As you probably know, the
  DNA Lounge <A HREF="http://www.dnalounge.com/cam/">webcasts</A>
  all of their events, and is full of Linux-based
  <A HREF="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/src/kiosk/">kiosks</A>
  with which you may chat with your in-club playmates.

  <P> There are also some <A HREF="http://www.schnitzer.at/mozparty/">
  satellite parties</A> happening elsewhere in the world to cater to
  the geographically challenged. (and those of you who think we are)

<P><LI><B>Am I actually invited?  I'm very insecure, and so this isn't
  totally clear to me yet.
</B>

  <P> Yes, you're invited!  And if you've contributed to the 
  <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/"><B>Mozilla</B></A> project, then you
  also get in for <I>free</I>!  Oh wait, I forgot, everyone gets in for 
  free.  Nevermind, then.

<P><LI><B>Who's DJing?  Will there be entertainment?
</B>

  <P> Your main room DJs for the evening will be the residents from 
  <A HREF="http://www.dnalounge.com/">DNA Lounge's</A> world famous
  thursday night <A HREF="http://www.dnalounge.com/0xC0DE/"><B>n:CODE +

<P><A NAME="transportation"><LI><B>How do I get there?</B>

  <P> By learning how to follow
  <A HREF="http://www.dnalounge.com/directions/"><B>directions</B></A>.

  <P> Also, a bus will be available to transport party guests
  between Mountain View and San Francisco. The bus will depart from
  the Building 21 parking lot on the Netscape Campus at 7:00 PM.
  and will leave the party at midnight. 

  Bus seats were available on a first come, first serve basis but
  all the seats are spoken for now. Sorry.

  <P>If you're taking the bus, don't forget your ID, or you won't get in!

<!--
  To reserve a spot on the bus, you must email
  <A HREF="mailto:marcia@mozilla.org?subject=Reserve me a seat on the bus from Mountain View to the DNA Lounge">
  marcia@mozilla.org</A>
  by June 10, 2002. Bus seats are available on a first come, first
  serve basis. You only need to RSVP to ride on the bus. You don't
  need to RSVP to get in to the party.
-->
  <P>
  We're offering the bus as a favor to minimize the chances that
  anyone would drink and drive. Mozilla.org and Netscape (who is paying
  the bill) are not liable for any accidents or problems that might
  occur on the bus ride.  Folks who aren't comfortable with this
  disclaimer shouldn't take the bus.
