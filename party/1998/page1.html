<P> It was about a week and a half before the end of March, 1998.
The source code was going to hit the wire on March 31st, and though
there was a general sense that we needed to have a party, nothing had
as yet been done about it.

<P> In one of our meetings, I laid out the plan: rent out a nightclub in San
Francisco, invite the world, and broadcast it over the net.  <I>``You mean
invite non-employees to the party?  But we've never done that before...''</I>
People were incredulous.  <I>``It's a new world,''</I> I said.  <I>``We're
giving away the code.  We're sharing responsibility for development of our
flagship product with the whole net, so we should invite them to the party as
well!''</I>

<P> I did some research, called some friends, and we found that one
of San Francisco's largest nightclubs,
<A HREF="http://www.sfclubs.com/soundfactory/"><B>Sound
Factory</B></A>, was available on wednesday night, April 1st.

<P> I reported back, and was met with what, in the most generous terms, can
only be described as pathetic whining.  <I>``But San Francisco is so far
away,''</I> they bleated.  <I>``Why don't we just have a party in the
Netscape cafeteria?''</I>

<P> Damn the torpedoes.  I was having a party and they couldn't stop me.
