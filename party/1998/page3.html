<P> The Netscape Public Relations department saw my invitation, and their
eyes filled with terror.

<P> <I>``Tell Jamie he has to make it clear that this is his party, not a
Netscape event,''</I> came the word from on high.  <I>``Oh, and get him to
take out that comment about Marc Andreessen cage-dancing nude.  That's really
not the kind of image we'd like to project.''</I>

<P> Meanwhile, I had learned that I had at least a dozen guarenteed
attendees, since the whole PR department was going to be there, on the off
chance that a Netscape employee showed up, they felt it necessary to protect
said employee from the swarming reporters.  Engineers?  Alcohol?  Press?
Control!  Must have control!

<P> Then I got some bad news: Andreessen had agreed to speak at the 
<A HREF="http://www.svlug.org/"><B>Silicon Valley Linux User's Group</B></A>
meeting that night!  I couldn't believe it.  Two events appealing to the same
group, one in San Jose and one in San Francisco.  So, I tried to convince the
SVLUG folks to relocate their meeting to the Sound Factory: we could open the
doors earlier, have the Linux meeting there, and then have the party
afterwards.

<P> This suggestion was met with similar bleatings to those that emanated
from VP-like objects at Netscape: <I>``San Francisco is so far away...''</I>

<P> They had an alternate proposal: <I>``How about you hype our event on your
incredibly popular web site, and in return, we'll suggest to people that they
carpool to your party afterward?''</I>  Wow.  What a deal.  But, I'm a big
softie, I went along with it anyway, fully expecting that nobody who had
driven all the way down to San Hoser was going then drive north to
civilization on the same night.

<P> Nobody was going to show.  There were going to be twenty of us in a
gigantic empty room.  The party was doomed.
