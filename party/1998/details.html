as told by an evil leprechaun to your host,

</P>



<OL>

<P><B><LI>What's all this, then?</B>

  <P> Read the <A HREF="flyer.html"><B>flyer</B></A>.

<P><B><LI>So this is a joke, right?  It's on April 1st.  So it's a joke,
right?</B>

  <P> No, it's not a joke.  It's on April 1st, because the source is going to
  hit the net on March 31st. The source is going out on March 31st because
  that's when the folks who wrote Netscape's press release said it would go
  out, way back on January 22nd.

  <P> Besides, posting a joke announcement a week <I>before</I> April Fool's
  Day would be bad form.

<P><B><LI>Who is throwing this party?</B>

  <P> The party is being thrown by Jamie Zawinski, Private Citizen, with
  extensive help from Random (promoter of the 
  <A HREF="http://www.sirius.com/~calyn/slick.html"><B>Slick</B></A>
  fetish ball.)

  <P> It is not being thrown by Netscape Communications Corporation, because,
  you see, Netscape is a very big company, and therefore has lawyers, and is
  therefore incapable of doing anything truly fun.  However, I expect a whole
  lot of Netscape employees to show up, because Netscape employees are
  generally a fun bunch, even though the Body Corporate is not permitted to
  be.

<P><B><LI>Is this going to be some lame-ass corporate party?
</B>

  <P> No.  This is not going to be the kind of party where you ride a bus
  to the marina and then spend three hours trapped on a boat with your 
  manager while a flock of baby boomers from Sales dance the ``Funky 
  Chicken.''  Instead, it's going to be the other kind of party: the kind
  you would actually want to go to.  See also ``fun'' above.
  
<P><B><LI>Am I actually invited, or is this only open to Netscape folks?
</B>

  <P> This party is open to anyone who cares about Open Source.
  Open Source, Open Party, get it?  Presumably, by that metric,
  there will be a lot of Netscape folks present, so come out and
  meet them!

<P><B><LI>Does that mean drinks are free?</B>

  <P> No, it means you get in for free.  You still have to pay Nice Mister
  Bartender.  What, do you think we're <I>made</I> of money?  

<P><B><LI>I'm not yet 21!  My friend is not yet 18!  Can we still get in?
</B>

  <P> Sound Factory is a 21+ venue.

<P><B><LI>I don't live anywhere near San Francisco.  Will you buy me a
plane ticket?</B>

  <P> Ha ha ha.  No.

  <P> If you live in Seattle, you might want to go to 
  <A HREF="http://www.go2net.com/people/paulp/mozilla-party/"><B>Paul's
  party</B></A>, on the 31st (the day before.)  If you're a truly hip
  jet-setter, you'll go to both.

  <P> Some other folks are holding source-release parties on April 1:

  <P><UL>
    <LI><A HREF="http://www.courts-of-chaos.com/mozilla/montreal.html"><B>Julie Lavoie</B></A> is having a
    party somewhere in Montreal, Canada.
    <LI><A HREF="mailto:daves@itol.com"><B>Dave Schrubbe</B></A> is
    throwing a party at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh.
    <LI><A HREF="http://www.tummy.com/mozilladotparty/"><B>Sean
    Reifschneider</B></A> is throwing a party in northern Colorado.
    <LI><A HREF="mailto:rop@xs4all.nl"><B>Rop Gonggrijp</B></A> is throwing
    a party at <A HREF="http://www.waag.org/">The Waag</A> in Amsterdam.
    <LI><A HREF="http://tuxedo.org/"><B>Chuck Peters and Eric Raymond</B></A>
    are throwing a party in Philadelphia.
    <LI><A HREF="mailto:spot-ncssm@rocketmail.com"><B>Samuel Potts</B></A>
    is throwing a party in Durham, North Carolina.
    <LI><A HREF="mailto:oyvindmo@pvv.ntnu.no"><B>Øyvind Møll</B></A>
    is throwing a party in Trondheim, Norway.
    <LI><A HREF="mailto:Randy.Shepherd@msfc.nasa.gov"><B>Randy Shepherd</B></A>
    is throwing a party in Huntsville, Alabama.
  </UL>
  <P> If you're throwing a party in your own city, let me 
  <A HREF="mailto:jwz@netscape.com"><B>know</B></A> and I'll list it here.

<P><B><LI>But I'm going to be at IETF in LA that day!  Waaah!</B>

  <P> I'm sorry.  The source goes out on the 31st.  The following night is
  clearly the time to have the party.  Flights from LA to SF are cheap and
  fast, and don't involve jet-lag.  Live on the edge.

<P><B><LI>But I'm going to be in San Francisco for JavaOne the week before!
Waaah!</B>

  <P> I'm sorry.  The source goes out on the 31st.  Having the party
  before that would be lame, and besides, we're busy getting the source
  ready to ship.  Perhaps you should extend your stay for a few more days.
  There's plenty to do in San Francisco.  Call in sick.  It is your duty
  as an oppressed worker to steal from your employers.

<P><B><LI>But I was planning on going to see Marc Andreessen speak at
the Silicon Valley Linux User's Group meeting that night!</B>

  <P> You can do both!  Go see Fearless Leader, then come to the
  party.  Rumor has it that the SVLUG folks are going to organize a massive
  carpooling effort of some kind, so this might actually be an easier way for
  you to get to the party, if you have a way of getting to San Jose but not
  to San Francisco.

  <P> The marca talk runs from <B>7pm-9pm</B> on the Cisco Systems campus
  in San Jose.  See <A HREF="http://www.svlug.org/meetings.shtml"><B>SVLUG's
  page</B></A> on the event.


<P><B><LI>Are you going to broadcast live video of the party over the internet?
</B>

  <P> 
  <A HREF="http://www.proxim.com/"><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="proxim.jpg" 
     WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=140 BORDER=0></A>

  Yes!  Thanks to the generous help of the folks at
  <A HREF="http://www.proxim.com/"><B>Proxim</B></A>, who are lending us
  the necessary hardware to get a wireless T1 link to the nightclub,
  and the folks at <A HREF="http://www.hypno.net/"><B>Hypnovista</B></A>,
  who are providing the Internet connectivity at the other end, we will
  be able to broadcast (and receive) internet video at the party!
  Wish us luck; we've got a lot of machines to set up and cable to run
  and only a few hours in which to do it...

  <BR CLEAR=BOTH><P>
  <A HREF="http://www.realnetworks.com/"><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="rbnlogo.jpg" 
     WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=64 BORDER=0></A>
  We will be broadcasting video over MBONE, and also, thanks to the fine folks
  at <A HREF="http://www.realnetworks.com/"><B>RealNetworks</B></A>, over
  <A HREF="http://www.real.com/products/player/"><B>RealVideo</B></A>.

  <P> <B>Note:</B> if you know how to reflect MBONE (vic/vat) into CuSeeMe,
  we'd like to hear from you...

<P><B><LI>Hey, how about Quake?</B>

  <P> Indeed!  It looks like we'll have a few machines networked together
  for a big-screen Quake match.  Details to follow...

<P><B><LI>Who's DJing?</B>

   <DD> The

   station is about six blocks away, and the 
  <A HREF="http://www.transitinfo.org/cgi-bin/map_sched/CT"><B>CalTrain</B></A>
   station is about four blocks away.  

   <P>The last BART train leaves
   <A HREF="http://www.transitinfo.org/cgi-bin/map_sched/C=BA?125,215">
   <B>Embarcadero Station</B></A> at <B>12:26am</B>, but the trains start

   4th Street Station</B></A> at <B>10:00pm</B>, and the trains start running
   again at <B>5:00am</B>.  (Note: the schedule lists an 11:59pm train, but
   don't be <NOBR>fooled --</NOBR> the footnotes show that that train only
   runs on friday.)

   <P> You can also get to Palo Alto on by bus as late as <B>12:28am</B> by

  </DL>

<P><B><LI>Is it true that Marc Andreessen will be cage-dancing nude?</B>

  <P> No, there is absolutely no truth to that rumor.  Please don't mention
  it again.

<P><B><LI>Who did that cool graphic?</B>

  <P> Shepard Fairey of <A HREF="http://www.blkmrkt.com/"><B>Black 
  Market</B></A>, who is also the mad mastermind behind the
  <A HREF="http://www.andrethegiant.com/"><B>Andre the Giant has a
  Posse</B></A> ten-year media blitz.  Isn't it great?

  just too many people?</B>

  <P> Um, it's looking that way, yes...
