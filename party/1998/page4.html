<P> Then the other kind of mail started coming in: 

<UL>
<P><LI> ``I'm flying in from Sweden to go to your party, can you recommend a
nearby hotel?''

<P><LI> ``A bunch of us are driving a bus from Florida, see you there!''

<P><LI> ``Do you know the best way to the club from the Golden Gate Bridge?
I'm driving down from Eureka.''

<P><LI> ``How big is this place, anyway?  I've gotten your invitation from
six different mailing lists already.''

<P><LI> ``One of my co-workers is on some lesbian computer programmer
mailing list, and one of the mails that went through was "mozilla.org
is having a party, let's go!"  I suspect that this isn't unique.

<P> So just in case every single person comes out of the woodwork (and
Unibomber psycho clones with them) does the party have, like, security
guards and bouncers and general ass-kickers for people who get out of
line?''

</UL>

<P> We had been considering making some posters and 
<A HREF="flyer.html"><B>flyers</B></A> to spread around
in <A HREF="http://www.vivid.com/vividians/gulch/"><B>Multimedia Gulch</B></A>
and at the <A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/javaone/"><B>JavaOne</B></A>
conference.  At this point, it was clear that such tactics were not necessary.

<P> I was glad of that, actually, because of a conversation that has
transpired between me and a club promoter a few months back.  He had
handed me a flyer for his club, and I said, <I>``I wonder how long it will
be before people stop promoting clubs with paper, and do it solely
through the net?''</I>  To which he replied, <I>``Well, that would be when
I have to stop going out, because I'm afraid of computers.''</I>

<P> I note that I didn't see him at the party.
