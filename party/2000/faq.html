<P><B><LI>Party?  What party?</B>

  <P> Read the <A HREF="flyer.html"><B>flyer</B></A>.

<P><B><LI> So you're throwing a party, and there will be a cool band
there, and you're not charging admission, and in attendance will be many
attractive members of the appropriate sex for whatever my perverted taste 
is, and the drinks are free?
</B>

  <P> You have to pay for the drinks.  Don't be a cheapskate.

<P><B><LI> What's so great about open source code that it deserves a party?
</B>

  <P> Don't worry about that.  It's a party.  If you need to know the
  answer to that question, ask someone there.

<P><B><LI> The invitation says that the venue is 21+.  I'm not yet 21, 
  but I <I>am</I> really cute and possibly sexually promiscuous.  
  Can I come?
</B>

  <P> If you're sexually promiscuous, then you presumably know the answer
  to that question.

  <P> Seriously, what part of <B><I>21+</I></B> don't you understand?

<P><B><LI> Will you go out of your way to help me get to the party?  
  I live in Iceland and my rowboat has a hole in it.
</B>

  <P> We'll help you from the sidewalk to the door (and the reverse,
  should you become a drunken nuisance.)  Anything else is your
  responsibility.

<P><B><LI>Am I actually invited?  I'm very insecure, and so this isn't
  totally clear to me yet.
</B>

  <P> Yes, you're invited!  And if you've contributed to the 
  <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/"><B>Mozilla</B></A> project, then you
  also get in for <I>free</I>!  Oh wait, I forgot, everyone gets in for 
  free.  Nevermind, then.

<P><B><LI>Where should I deliver the bandages?</B>

  <P> Um, no. Its Open <I>Source</I> we're celebrating.

<P><B><LI>Yow! Why does the flyer take so long to load?</B>

  <P> Oh ye of little faith! Stop yapping and go eat your
      <A HREF="../../projects/seamonkey/release-notes/">dogfood</A>.
      (See question three)

<P><A NAME="transportation"><B><LI>How do I get there?</B>

  <P> By learning how to follow
  <A HREF="directions.html"><B>directions</B></A>.

  <P> Also, two busses will be available to transport party guests 
  between Mountain View and San Francisco. Busses will depart from
  the Building 21 parking lot on the Netscape Campus at 7:00 PM. 
  One bus will leave the party at Midnight and the second bus will
  leave when the party ends at 2:00 AM. To reserve a spot on the bus,
  you must email 
  <A HREF="mailto:marcia@mozilla.org?subject=Reserve me a seat on the bus from Mountain View to the Sound Factory">
  marcia@mozilla.org</A>
  by April 4, 2000. Bus seats are available on a first come, first
  serve basis. You only need to RSVP to ride on the bus. You don't
  need to RSVP to get in to the party.
  <P>
  We're offering the buses as a favor to minimize the chances that
  anyone would drink and drive. Mozilla.org and Netscape (who is paying
  the bill) are not liable for any accidents or problems that might
  occur on the bus ride.  Folks who aren't comfortable with this 
  disclaimer shouldn't take the bus.
