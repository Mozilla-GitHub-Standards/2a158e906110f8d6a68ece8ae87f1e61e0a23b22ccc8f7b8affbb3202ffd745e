notes on how default prefs work in mozilla
soon to be a real document, part of the prefs documentation
sspitzer@mozilla.org


look at mozilla/modules/libpref/src/init/mailnews.js
that file contains all the mailnews default prefs.

here's how it works:

that file (mailnews.js) and the other pref default files (like all.js, editor.js) get
put into the defaults/pref directory.


ls mozilla/dist/bin/defaults/pref

at startup time, we read in all the .js files in that directory, 
evaluates all those files (the are javascript) and stores the name/value pairs 
into the prefs context.

then, the user's prefs (~/.mozilla/<profile name>/prefs.js) get read in, and 
those values over ride the default values.

why having a default pref is good:
JS exceptions

other topics: 
alphabetical order of pref file evaluation
all-ns.js convention
