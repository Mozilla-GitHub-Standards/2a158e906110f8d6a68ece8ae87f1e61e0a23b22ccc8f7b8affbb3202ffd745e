- Stanley: Which applets need to be recompiled?

  Basically Stanley feels that if an applet has been compiled with 1.1
  vintage JDK, it should be re-compiled with a 1.2 vintage.  The
  backwards compatability story is unknown.  In order to do a good job
  of understanding the compatability issues, we're going to need
  machines with old versions of Netscape and Java.  Can someone help
  with this?

=> jeff to create tracking bug and put what he knows about how the
  running of applets has changed between 4.x and 6.0.

=> edburns to re-mail George the ekrock mail, George to follow up.

- Java working on the trunk?

=> Xiaobin to create a solution to notify us when mozilla headers change
  from those in the RTM branch.  Xiaobin, I'll send a separate mail
  describing the requirements and one possible implementation.

- OJI2 design review next Monday morning.

=> edburns to schedule room.

  We will review both Nikolay's security document, and the main
  document.

  Stanley wanted to know what is the goal of waterfall.

- Bug etiquette

  0. Try to have no bugs in the NEW state.  

  1. either [oji_working] or [oji_waiting] in Status Whiteboard for all
  your bugs.  "Working" means you're actively working on it at least
  once a day.  "Waiting" means you're not working on it for some reason,
  perhaps you're blocked, perhaps it's not on the top of your plate,
  etc.  You should have less than five working bugs.
