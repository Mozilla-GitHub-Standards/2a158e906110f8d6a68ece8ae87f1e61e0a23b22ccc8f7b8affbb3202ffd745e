Joe Chou


New Agenda Items:
-----------------

- Netscape 6.1Beta on Solaris + JRE 1.4 "No Worky".

- Arun asks when Java Plug-In can deliver fix for major memory leak.

- Installer status (Java Plug-In).


New Action Items for next week:
---------------------------------


Joe: status reports twice a day on the N6.1Beta on Solaris + JRE 1.4
     no worky issue.  Work with Stanley, Steve Katz, OJI group to
     resolve problem.  Critical: working build due this Friday.

Jim: Reply to Arun on likelihood of memory leak bug fix making
     it to Netscape 6 soon.  ETA: Friday, 6/22/2001.

Jim: Meet with Chris Hofmann this week to discuss solution to
installer problems.

Xiaobin: Test JRE 1.4 on Win32 with Netscape 6.1Beta.
DONE.  Works, with some LiveConnect problems (as expected).  This
       differs from Solaris N6.1 Beta + JRE 1.4, which crashes upon
       visiting any site that has an applet, whether with LiveConnect
       or not.

Joe: File BugTraq bug against 1.4 Java Plug-In, Bugzilla bug against
     Mozilla for not working on Solaris with 1.4 JPI.

Jim: Report to group by Friday about when escalation can be done for
     Siebel's LiveConnect issues.

George: Tell N6 Solaris release engineering to build on Mozilla 0.9.2
	when it is stable.

Xiaobin: How big is the task of merging our post-0.9.2 LiveConnect
	 patches into the N6.1Beta Solaris source tree, in case we
	 need to hand-patch the build?
