OJI Engineering Meeting, 24 July 2001

Question to the group: can we move next week's meeting up to 2pm?


New Action Items for next week: This means you're on the hook to do something!
---------------------------------

* Everyone must start keeping a contract discovery document that
  contains information you learn about the contracts impacting Java
  while fixing bugs.

* Everyone must have no bugs in the NEW state by Friday.  Also, all bugs
  assigned to you must have a priority, severity, and target milestone.

* Ed to poll team for ideas about how best to discover the contracts in
  the software.

* Ed to ping Jeff Loomans monthly to see if he's happy. DONE

* Joe to reassign 4395734 McNealy Report sun.audio bug to someone on
  Java team.

* Xiaobin to ask Jim about Applet lifecycle changes in JDK1.4?

  NOT DONE, CARRIED OVER
 
  Ed to read Jim's document on this matter.

* Ed to contact Greg Argyle to ask about changes getting in to eMojo

* Xiaobin to push hard for Thursday 3pm meeting with Beard.

* Ed to look through 1.4 regressions as reported in bugzilla

* Joe to deal with issues about the Steve Katz's nsIModule change
  breaking java.  TOP PRIORITY.

* George: add new issue to be tracked: what features are missing from 
  current Java integration into Mozilla?  Task needs to be assigned, ETA
  delivered, list compiled into a document.

* George: Get Valerie Michael, Rhoda Fry, Angela Butler-McDonald 
  together in a Program Management summit to communicate plans better 
  (JPI/Moz/N6).

* George: Get status on JRE 1.4 regressions from Valerie; who is 
  tracking it?  (Valerie, I believe, but need to confirm)

* Nikolay must produce a list of components/features remaining to be
  checked into mozilla.org (e.g., HTTPS, signed applet, what else?).
  For each component give an estimate of when it will be checked in.

* Nikolay to tell when QA can begin on Waterfall (George asked Alexei
  Mokeev, awaiting answer)

* Nikolay to give a rough date on when Mac OS 9, Mac OS X support will
  be ready.  (Nikolay will need to rely on Terry and possibly Patrick
  for this)

* Nikolay to give status of embedded device support for our development
  partner (proprietary info may not leave Sun so partner's name omitted)

* Ed to give go/no-go decision on Contract discovery process by COB
  Friday.  

New Agenda Items:
-----------------

- Quality Improvement Plan

  Long term goal: Decrease bug influx rate by increasing quality

  Current Implementation Plan:

  Discover ALL the software contracts that touch Java, unwritten and
  explicit.  An example of a hidden software contract that touches Java
  is the applet lifecycle.  The Java Plugin has a very particular set of
  rules about when and how Applets must be started and stopped.  Many
  difficult bugs have resulted when this contract has been broken.  An
  example of an explicit contract is the mandate that the Java plugin
  must implement nsIModule.

  Goals for this meeting: 

  * Discuss the above implementation plan.  Will it achieve the long
    term goal?

   Answer: No, the above plan just gives us the ability to tell when we
   can achieve the goal.

  * How do we discover the contracts?  

  * Does it make sense to look at the 813 bugs that have ever been
    opened on OJI and put them into buckets, to see where most of the
    breakage occurrs and therefore where the contracts are fragile?


  * Who are the key players: Joe, Xiaobin, Stanley, Ed, Nikolay, Steve
    Katz, Jim Melvin, Patrick Beard, Andrei Volkov, Peter Lubczynski.
    Additional help may come from David Hyatt, David Baron, Doug Turner.

  * What are the factors for success of the contract discovery effort?  

  * What are the outputs of the effort?

  * How do we measure the success of the effort?

    Does having the contracts give us the ability to better estimate bug
    fix rates?  Does it give us the ability to ramp up a new engineer on
    the work more quickly?
  
- I think we need a dedicated program manager, what do you think?

- Mozilla 0.9.3 freeze tonight midnight.

- Siebel bug status?

- 39 Bugs in NEW state

- 77194, 64319, JDK1.4 status

- Bugtraq bugs assigned to our team:

4392736 -> JPI
4395734 -> joechou
4429702 -> JPI
4468955 -> JPI
4474404 -> JPI
4474425 -> JPI
4474958 -> JPI

* Siebel status: Jimmy Wu is satisfied with the JRE 1.4 beta build.  Our 
recommendation about when to use Netscape 6.X is: the browser is ready 
now, the Java part must wait until JRE 1.4 ships in March of 2002.  I 
have just communicated this to Ron Karim.

* Contract solidification: there are at least two steps, only one of 
which is being addressed right now:

	1) Discover and document all contracts

	2) Look at the data from step 1, see where the hot spots are, prioritize 
and schedule the re-work of those hot spots

* Bugzilla bug 77194: people involved are Xiaobin, Patrick, Stanley. 
Current ETA is 8/15/2001.

* Stanley says that 1.4 beta refresh freeze date is Thursday, August 2. 
  He claims that they'll have an additional week to "sneak in" fixes.

* LiveConnect documentation: assigned to Joe, he needs to produce an ETA 
by the end of this week.

* Contract solidification: assigned to Ed, he needs to reply by end of 
this week whether the task is worthwhile, and if so, what is the ETA.

* Java Plug-In future plans: assigned to Stanley, he needs to reply by 
next Tuesday (July 31) about the new development going on in JPI that 
will affect us.

* Many OJI bugs with no priorities set on them: all need to set 
priorities by this Friday, July 27.

* Waterfall: assigned to Nikolay, he owes the following:

	- List of components/features left to checked into mozilla.org (e.g., 
HTTPS, signed applet, what else?)

	- ETA's for each component/feature yet to be checked in

	- When can QA begin? (George asked Alexei Mokeev, awaiting answer)

	- Mac OS 9, Mac OS X support: ETA (Nikolay will need to rely
	on Terry and possibly Patrick for this)

	- Status of embedded device support for our development partner 
(proprietary info may not leave Sun so partner's name omitted)



Old Action Items:
------------------------------

* Joe to produce some liveconnect documentation.

* Ed to find out code freeze date and version label for Next release of
  Netscape, known as the enterprise release.  For the record, the next
  release of Netscape is called eMojo.  There is no version number right
  now.  It will be based on 0.9.4, which freezes at 11:59PM PST on
  Tuesday 28 August 2001.

* Ed to re-investigate 61233 and see if hide and show shows the document.
NOT DONE; CARRIED OVER.

* Xiaobin to start prototyping solution for 77194 with Stanley and
  Nikolay's help.  Should have schedule for when the work will be done
  by next Tuesday.

Eta for completion of work in JPI and mozilla: 15 August 2001 Still true?

* Ed to research the best way for our team's experience to influence the
  design of the Java Plugin going forward.

  Talked to Roger Calnan, sent mail to Jim Melvin.

NOT DONE; CARRIED OVER
