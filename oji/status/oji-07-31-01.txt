New Action Items for next week: This means you're on the hook to do something!
---------------------------------

* Ed to ask to be in the loop for java-related changes to non-java modules.

* Ed to ask George about Terry's status

* Xiaobin to re-estimate 77194 by Friday

* Ed to add Ashu to OJI. DONE

* We should be a Peer to all components that impact OJI

  Ed to add to contract discovery document deliverables

* Ed to raise flag about JPI->nsIModule problems due to the "NS6 doesn't
  support multiple-user installations on Unix" problem.

* Joe to test 4395734 with ns6 build 44 on Solaris

* Ed to respond to Jeff Loomans's mail for Ron

* Ed: Get Valerie Michael, Rhoda Fry, Angela Butler-McDonald 
  together in a Program Management summit to communicate plans better 
  (JPI/Moz/N6).

* Ed to talk to George about this action item: add new issue to be
  tracked: what features are missing from current Java integration into
  Mozilla?  Task needs to be assigned, ETA delivered, list compiled into
  a document.

* George: Get status on JRE 1.4 regressions from Valerie; who is 
  tracking it?  (Valerie, I believe, but need to confirm)

* Ed to talk to Nikolay about these action items:

  * Nikolay must produce a list of components/features remaining to be
    checked into mozilla.org (e.g., HTTPS, signed applet, what else?).
    For each component give an estimate of when it will be checked in.

  * Nikolay to tell when QA can begin on Waterfall (George asked Alexei
    Mokeev, awaiting answer)

  * Nikolay to give a rough date on when Mac OS 9, Mac OS X support will
    be ready.  (Nikolay will need to rely on Terry and possibly Patrick
    for this)

  * Nikolay to give status of embedded device support for our development
    partner (proprietary info may not leave Sun so partner's name omitted)


Old Action Items:
------------------------------

* Ed to read Jim's document on applet lifecycle.

  NOT DONE, CARRIED OVER

* Ed to contact Greg Argyle to ask about changes getting in to eMojo

* Ed to look through 1.4 regressions as reported in bugzilla

* Ed to give go/no-go decision on Contract discovery process by COB
  Friday.  

* Joe to produce some liveconnect documentation. ETA 31 August

* Ed to find out code freeze date and version label for Next release of
  Netscape, known as the enterprise release.  For the record, the next
  release of Netscape is called eMojo.  There is no version number right
  now.  It will be based on 0.9.4, which freezes at 11:59PM PST on
  Tuesday 28 August 2001.

* Ed to re-investigate 61233 and see if hide and show shows the document.

  Nikolay's help.  Should have schedule for when the work will be done
  by next Tuesday.

Eta for completion of work in JPI and mozilla: 15 August 2001 Still true?

* Ed to research the best way for our team's experience to influence the
  design of the Java Plugin going forward.

  Talked to Roger Calnan, sent mail to Jim Melvin.

NOT DONE; CARRIED OVER

New Agenda Items:
-----------------

- Impact of lay-offs on OJI

- Liveconnect status

- Contract discovery process status

- Stanley's MRP update

  They're working on two things: 

  1.) Oracle RFE request.  

  2.) Make JPI be the default in IE
