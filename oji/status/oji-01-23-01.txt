      IBM is testing on Linux and Win using Netscape 6.

      OS/2 was using Snapshot of NS6 RTM for its RTM.  Now planning on
      using mozilla 0.8 RTM.

      IBM NT, Linux, OS/2 plugin goes out in March.

      JNI<->JS calls into SetMember.  First call works correctly,
      recursion depth gets incremented, then decremented, then nulls out
      CX pointer.

      Wants to add extensions to Java, using JNLP or WebStart.
