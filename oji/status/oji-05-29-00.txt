* 35775: Need to evaluate

* 23775: 

    => Ed to find out from George how important it is to have "no applets
     != no pluglets" feature.

    Stanley mentioned: if we go with "no applets == no pluglets" we will
    have to pop up a dialog saying: "you have to restart the browser"
    because the Java Plugin. can't be stopped mid stream.

    => Ed, ask Stanley if he can do this in the Java Plugin as a result
    of calling ShutdownJVM.

* Getting rid of jni.h

  Reviewed the status.  The problem is that nsISecureEnv depends on
  having a 1.1.x level jni.h in the tree.  If you don't have a 1.1.x
  level jni.h in the tree, LiveConnect will not build.  Can we remove
  the compile time dependency on java from LiveConnect?

* Auto download of JVM.  I talked to Jayashri today.  I'm still in my
  requirements gathering phase.  Stanley pointed out the importance of
  having versioning in the final solution.

  => Ed to get the timeframe for the completion of the "download JVM"
  work.

* 39050: Blocked waiting on patch from Russia to fix tests.

* Raju mentioned that people are downloading JDK1.3 from java.sun.com
  and finding that applets work with NS6 pr1.  However, they don't
  REALLY work.  It's just a fluke that applets work with the stock Jaza
  Plug-in from JDK1.3.  People are filing bugs using this plugin and
  these bugs are just phantom bugs.  Raju wants to make it so people
  don't make this mistake.  They should be using the Patch plugin from
  netscape.

  => George to own problem where uses get JDK1.3 JPI not stanleyh JPI.
