OJI Agenda 11-07-00

* Let's focus on the future:

  - Upcoming Netscape Milestones

  - Upcoming Sun Milestones

  - Nikolay's Waterfall project

    a). need design review, including input from Jim Melvin's team.
        Let's set a date.

    b). need to make decision on deployment strategy for this project.

  - Stanley, is there anything you need?

  - Ideas for future work:

    a). Fix up the OJI web page. 

      1. Pointers to all known OJI implementations

      2. Write a decent, useful, "How To Write an OJI Java Plugin"
      document

    c). New Features

      1. Security?

      2. Network?

* Bugs

  - The continuing saga of bug 53849:

    David Flannagan's article

    Fix is in the branch an trunk.

    New bugs found: Raju says getParameter() isn't working, even after
    the 53849 fix.

  - We have 89 non-Macintosh bugs right now.  Most of them are
    non-critical Solaris only bugs found Richard Pecson and co.  These
    are all owned by Joe.  

    Joe/Xiaobin: can you give half of these bugs to Xiaobin for
    prioritization and analysis, showing him how to run Mozilla/Java
    Plugin on Solaris if necessary.  The output of this analysis will
    be: 1. No bugs are in the NEW or UNCONFIRMED states; 2. For each
    engineer, the bugs should be in descending order of importance,
    according to your judgement.
