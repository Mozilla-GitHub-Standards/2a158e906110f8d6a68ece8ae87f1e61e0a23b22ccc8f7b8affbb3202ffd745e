<center><h2>Profile Migration</h2>

<p>On 3/17, a bunch of folks met about profile migration. We talked about
who owns which files in the profiles, and how we're going to build profiles
in 5.0. Here's a summary of interesting points, with open issues in <font color="#CC0000">red</font>.
<p><b>Profile Structure</b>
<blockquote>On the Mac, we have a useability problem which is that we put
profile data in the System Preferences folder. This hasn't worked well
because users think that anything in the Preferences folder can be deleted
with impunity, and profiles certainly don't fit that description. Profile
data will be stored in the Documents folder.
<p>On Windows, we're going to create a new Communicator directory and a
new Users directory, so the directory structure of a machine with 5.0 and
4.x would look like
<br>this:
<br><tt>- c:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; - Program Files</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Netscape</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + Communicator</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + Communicator5</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Users</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phil</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Users5</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phil</tt>
<p><font color="#CC0000">We didn't decide anything about UNIX since we
didn't have anyone in the room who had a clue about the right thing to
do on UNIX.</font></blockquote>
<b>Copy and Diverge</b>
<blockquote>We agreed that the minimum requirement for migrating profiles
from 4.x to 5.0 is that we'll copy the relevant files from 4.x and then
changes in 5.0 don't affect 4.x and vice versa. This is the minimum because
we don't want 5.0 bugs to break 4.x users, and we think that having each
version have its own files will have fewer bugs than if the versions shared
files.
<p><font color="#CC0000">If we have time (hah) or lots of motivation, we
could enable sharing mail folders between 4.x and 5.0.</font> This has
the advantage of smaller disk footprint.
<p>I'd like to know what others think about this. It's a little bit of
a reversal for me, since I thought we'd want to share mail folders. The
time constraints and quality risk are convincing me that this is extra,
and perhaps optional, work.
<p>Another option is just to document how to share the folders using the
"mail.directory" preference <font color="#CC0000">(if that's available
in 5.0??)</font>
<p>We agreed that it would be helpful for the migration tool to offer to
clean up some disk space in 4.x by deleting the old cache and summary files.</blockquote>
<b>Address Books</b>
<blockquote>We need to refine our plan for address book migration. Our
tentative plan has always been to offer a migration tool (not built into
5.0) which knows how to read 4.x address book files and generates MORK.
This is certainly a big chunk of work, and it would make the import tool
more complicated.
<p>It was suggested that we create a new directory in the profile directory
just for address books. Since there can be a bunch of them, this seemed
ok to me.</blockquote>
<b>Security</b>
<blockquote>The Security group needs to own upgrading any/all necessary
security files</blockquote>
<b>Prefs file</b>
<blockquote>We agreed that there will be one Javascript preferences file,
and it will be called prefs.js on all platforms. Some items which are prefs
in 4.x will move into a style sheet for 5.0. This mostly means window size
and position, column widths, etc. Anything which is editable in the prefs
UI, or which needs to be locked by Mission Control, can not be moved into
a style sheet.</blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Here are a few mail/news-specific things that we didn't
discuss, but are still important.
<p><b>Newsgroups</b>
<blockquote>One of the most frequently reported problems I see with 4.x
is that Communicator doesn't remember the newsgroups that users subscribe
to, and they have to resubscribe every time they open the app. I think
this is caused when users move their profile directory to a new location,
but leave the FAT file pointing to the old location. <font color="#CC0000">I
think we should consider breaking compatibility with 4.x (and 3.x) FAT
files by storing relative paths instead of absolute paths.</font>
<p>The UNIX version never needed a FAT file since filenames can be as long
as you want, but Mac and Windows did. Perhaps we can drop the FAT file
for Win32 now, too, since Win16 is no longer supported. I assume the Mac
soldiers on with its old filesystem, and need for a FAT file.</blockquote>
<b>Multiple identities</b>
<blockquote>I assume we want to create more hierarchy in the mail folder
for multiple POP accounts.</blockquote>
<b>Filters</b>
<blockquote>The UE folks have a proposed filter design where all of the
filters are editable at one time, rather than the 4.x system where there's
a filter file for each scope (mail server, newsgroup, etc.). <font color="#CC0000">We
need to work out how the persistence model for filtering works.</font></blockquote>
