     I would not say that. The net is a tempermental beastie and it is
not at all unusual for a file to temporarily go -missing-. I would not
refer to this as an "unusual edge case."
     The net is supposed to be fault tolerant - you must PLAN a safe
failsafe if a needed file fails.
     A missing '.css' just renders like crap without the need to pop an
alert box. It might actually be cool if an alert popped up stating "SOME
STYLE DEFINITIONS WERE UNABLE TO BE LOAD, THIS DOCUMENT MAY NOT DISPLAY
CORRECTLY" or some such...

     I Disagree - the MOST likely cause is simply buggy code, or missing
files (or crreped-out files due to dropped packets...).. there IS a lot
of it about...
    What I meant to suggest above is that the most common manner in
which a site will fail to accomodate Moz is this: Bad browser detection.

    Much bad browser detection will make it through the interpreter just
fine (Version string checking, which is the most common method of
browser detection used.) This may NOT cause the dreaded calls to .all or
.layers, but simply result in a dumbed-down page or a "this browser not
supported page."

    I would might welcome an alert which triggered specifically on calls
to .all or .layers, but to trigger it for every Javascript error (or
every nonexistant function) would be uncalled for, misleading, and
annoying..

    Also, it might be better to point out that the site does not support
the W3C spec, rather than the particular browser... put the 'blame'
clearly on non-standard-compliant web-coders, rather than some
pain-in-the-butt browser which must be specifically accomodated (this is
what this next-level stuff is supposed to obviate...).

See above - what should be emphasized is that the sites need to comply
to the W3C STANDARDS, not an upstart-browser. The perception that Moz is
a problem which must be specifically coded for will put a stake through
this thing's heart faster than you can say "ouch!"

I certainly agree on many, many points.. see

Sigh.. I'll try to be patient!
