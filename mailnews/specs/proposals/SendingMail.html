<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Currently, when the user composes a mail message and Sends the
message, the Mail Compose window disappears immediately. This was
originally done on purpose to give the perception of a fast mail
application. Some usability problems have been found with this
implementation.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Users have expressed concerns of not getting adequate feedback
   regarding whether the message has actually been sent.&nbsp; During
   usability testing, a frequent comment from users is "Did it get
   sent?".&nbsp; Many even go to their Sent folder for verification.
   Some novice users requested the feature of a modal dialog that
   pops up when a message is sent. ("Don't show this dialog
   again".)</LI>
   
   <LI>The Compose window closes when sent, giving the appearance
   that the action was successful. If the send operation then fails,
   the Compose windows reappears and gives the user an error message.
   Since the user already thought the message was sent, this is often
   confusing behavior.</LI>
   
   <LI>There is no obvious way to cancel a send that is taking to
   long.</LI>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H1>4.x Behavior</H1>

<P>When a message is sent using 4.x:</P>

<OL>
   <LI>The Mail Compose window remains open until the message is
   really sent.</LI>
   
   <LI>Status of the message send operation appears in the Mail
   Compose window status bar (visual and text).</LI>
   
   <LI>A Progress window appears on top of the Mail Compose window
   indicating the status of the send operation (visual and text).
   Note: this dialog may sometimes appear and disappear very quickly,
   but even the quick appearance of this dialog is helpful feedback
   to users.</LI>
   
   <LI>A Cancel button appears on the progress dialog.&nbsp; If a
   message is taking a long time to send, the send operation can be
   canceled.</LI>
</OL>
