  <li>A "contains" search on &quot;Subject&quot; or &quot;Sender&quot; is

Topics</h1>

<ol>
  <li><i>Name of toolbar?</i> Search Bar.</li>
  <li><i>Location of Search Bar.</i> Above the column headers in Thread Pane
    instead of below Toolbar.</li>
  <li><i>If the account level is selected in the Folder Pane, can a Search on
    the whole account be done? Or does the Search Toolbar become disabled? </i>With
    redesign, Search Bar is not visible when an Account is selected.</li>
  <li><i>Type of search?&nbsp; A -&nbsp; "contains" search on "subject", "sender" and
    &quot;body&quot;.&nbsp; B -&nbsp; "contains" search on &quot;subject&quot;
    and&nbsp; "sender" .&nbsp;</i> Contains Subject or Sender.</li>
  <li><i>Do we want to allow users to type in the +,&nbsp; -, or&nbsp; "" notations?&nbsp;</i>
    No. No need to complicate. Plus if we allow it here, would advanced search
    need to allow it as well?</li>
  <li><i>Label text says &quot;Search for:&quot; or &quot;Subject or Sender
    contains:&quot;?</i> &quot;Subject or Sender contains&quot; by default. Will
    be a preference to change the search to Subject only or Sender only.&nbsp;
    Text displayed should update as appropriate.</li>
  <li> The default for Search Bar is open.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>A "contains" search on &quot;Subject&quot; or &quot;Sender&quot; is performed
by default.&nbsp; Using Preferences, users can change the search to
&quot;Subject contains:&quot; or &quot;Sender contains:&quot;.&nbsp; The text
displayed in the Search Bar should reflect the current setting.</li>
<li>As the user types text into the text field, the Thread Pane updates to
display only those headers that match the query. Typing more text in the field
refines the search (only searches the remaining items), while deleting
characters restores those headers that now match the query.&nbsp; Clearing all
the text from the field restores the full contents of the selected folder.</li>
<li>The search results are displayed using the same sort order that was set by
the user before the search occurred. While search results are displayed, the
sort order can be changed.</li>
<li>Selecting a different folder, newsgroup or account cancels the search.&nbsp;
For example:

<ul>
  <li>Select the Inbox and type &quot;fred&quot; in the search field.</li>
  <li>Select a different folder. The Thread Pane displays the contents of the
    selected folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Select the Inbox again.&nbsp; The full contents of the Inbox is displayed.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Once the users starts typing in the text field, no message in the Thread Pane
should be selected and the Message Pane should be empty.</li>

<li>If no matching items are found, the text, &quot;No matches
found.&quot; is displayed in the Status bar.&nbsp; The Message pane, if open,
is empty.</li>
<li> Tabbing in Three Pane Mail works clockwise, so if the search
field has focus, a tab will cause the Thread Pane to have focus.</li>
<li> Most all actions available on messages
should be available to the search result messages.&nbsp; For example, double
clicking to open the message, drag and drop to move or copy a message, deleting
messages, forwarding, replying, etc. should all be available. * TBD,
Potentially, some View and Navigation type actions may no be available.</li>
<li>&nbsp;If the user pulls or receives new messages
while search results are being displayed, and any of the new messages match the
search criteria, the Thread Pane displaying the matching results is NOT
updated.&nbsp; If the user were to perform the search again, though, the new
messages would be displayed.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Users are able to drag and drop results of the search to other folders. Just
like drag and drop in the Three Pane Mail, a Move is preformed.&nbsp;
Accelerator plus drag and drop is a copy.&nbsp; When drag and dropping newsgroup
messages, a copy is always performed.</li>
<li>This feature should work the same in Newsgroups, although it may
be a little slower if there are a large number of postings.</li>
