<b><font size="4">Mail Issues Meeting<br>

</font></b>Date:&nbsp; Wed Dec 06 2000&nbsp;

<p>Discussed the top Mail related problems users had during the recent

"First Usage" Usability Study. A usability study was conducted a few

weeks ago which looked at some of the common actions users perform when

installing and first using the Netscape product.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Top Mail Related Issues:</h3>

<ol>

  <li>Problems launching Mail. Users don't understand the difference between ISP mail and Webmail. When

    asked to start up mail, almost all users launched Webmail from the Personal Bookmarks bar or the

    Netscape Homepage (default homepage). When asked to look for a non-webmail account, the launcher

    icons and Task menu --> Mail items were not immediately obvious to users.</li>

  <li>Problems with mail startup.When an account is migrated and Mail is launched for the first time, the&nbsp;<br>

    Thread Pane and Message Pane area are blank. The account(s) are collapsed. I believe the default&nbsp;<br>

    account level is selected. Users clicked on the "Get Msg" button and nothing visibly changed to them&nbsp;<br>

    (because the Inbox was not selected). Users had to be told to expand the account and select the Inbox to

    see their mail.</li>

  <li>New Account Setup. When asked to setup a new mail account, most users had trouble finding

    the Account Settings.</li>

  <li>AB. Users go to the first AB by default. Currently this is the CAB which

    is sometimes confusing to users.</li>

</ol>

<p>



The first issue we will deal with is:  Contents of the Mail Thread

Pane/Message Thread Pane when an Account Level item is selected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>



When an account is migrated and Mail is launched for the first time, the

Thread Pane and Message Pane area are blank. The account(s) are

collapsed. I believe the default account level is selected. Users are

confused as to why no mail is visible.  Users clicked on the "Get Msg"

button to access their mail. Because the account level is selected (and

not an Inbox), nothing visually changes to the user in the Thread Pane

(it remains blank).  Users had to be told to expand the account and

select the Inbox to see their mail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>



Bug 49753 - Contents of the Mail Thread Pane when an Account Level item

is selected, covers this issue and suggests some potential solutions:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>

  <li> When the Account level is selected, display its subfolders in the

right

pane with summary info (total read/unread).</li>

  <li>Don't let users select the Account Level if they can't do anything

with it.

(If there is no functionality available, don't allow this level to be

selected)&nbsp;</li>

  <li>Display the following text in the thread pane: "There are no messages



available at this level. Please select a folder."&nbsp;</li>

  <li>Display the following text in the thread pane: "There are no messages



available at this level. Please select a folder. To view settings for

this

account click here." (where "here" is a link to the Account Settings

dialog for

the selected account).&nbsp;</li>

  <li>Provide static account information about the selected account and

provide a

link to the Account Settings dialogs.  Becomes 2 pane mail instead of 3

pane

mail.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>Display account information and allow the user to modify account

setting



Feedback and ideas appreciated.</li>

</ol>
