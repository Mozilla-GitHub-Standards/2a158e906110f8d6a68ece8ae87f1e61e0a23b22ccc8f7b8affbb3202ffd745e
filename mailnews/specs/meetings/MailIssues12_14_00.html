<p><b>Mail Issues Meeting, 12/14/00</b><br>

<br>

We discussed the problems associated with Bug 49753. When the Account Level is selected in Mail, the&nbsp;<br>

Thread Pane and Message Pane are blank and often confusing for users.<br>

<br>

As a minimum, we agreed that we need to put informative text in the Thread Pane when the account level&nbsp;<br>

is selected. "There are no messages available at the level. Select the Inbox to view your mail."<br>

<br>

If time/resources permit, we would like to use the right mail pane to provide useful information to the user&nbsp;<br>

when an account level item is selected in the left pane. This useful information would be called "Account&nbsp;<br>

Summary" view.<br>

<br>

<br>

Option 1 - IF WE ARE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE "ACCOUNT SUMMARY" VIEW<br>

1. The first time that mail is launched, the Default Account should be expanded. The Inbox for the default&nbsp;<br>

account is selected.<br>

2. Put informative text in the Thread Pane when the account level is selected. "There are no messages&nbsp;<br>

available at the level. Select the Inbox to view your mail."<br>

<br>

<br>

Option 2 - IF WE ARE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE "ACCOUNT SUMMARY" VIEW<br>

1. The first time that mail is launched, the Default Account should be expanded. The Account Level is&nbsp;<br>

selected.  The new "Account Summary" view is shown in the right pane.<br>

2. Future Usage. When Mail is launched, accounts should be expanded/collapsed as the user last left&nbsp;<br>

them. If the default account was left expanded, the Inbox should be selected by default.<br>

3. Account Summary View. Not 100%, but most agreed we would like to see links to mail tasks, such as&nbsp;<br>

"Read my mail" and  "Setup a new account".  Other possibilities include displaying account folder&nbsp;<br>

information, displaying useful help tips, or a combination of account folder information and links to mail&nbsp;<br>

tasks.<br>

<br>

<br>

It was also discussed that many folks commented they would like to see the "Total" and "Unread" columns&nbsp;<br>

returned in the Folder Pane. We would like to provide the column selector widget in the "Mail Folders"&nbsp;<br>

pane so that users can add "Total" and "Unread" columns if desired.  They would not be displayed as the&nbsp;<br>

default.</p>
