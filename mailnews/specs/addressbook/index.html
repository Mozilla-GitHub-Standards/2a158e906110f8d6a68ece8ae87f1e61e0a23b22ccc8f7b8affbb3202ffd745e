<H1>Summary</H1>

<H3>Goals</H3>

<UL>
   <LI>Provide a place for users to store contact information for
   business associates, colleagues, friends and family.</LI>
   
   <LI>Provide an easy method for adding message senders to the
   user's Address Book.</LI>
   
   <LI>Provide a way for users to quickly select recipients for an
   email message.</LI>
   
   <LI>Provide a quick and convenient method of viewing contact
   data.</LI>
   
   <LI>Provide a quick and convenient method of editing existing
   contact data.</LI>
   
   <LI>Provide a way for users to quickly select recipients for an
   AIM or ICQ session (Netscape).</LI>
   
   <LI>Provide option to automatically collect the email addresses
   from outgoing messages.</LI>
   
   <LI>Provide a method to find/look up people in available
   directories (Netcenter, LDAP).</LI>
   
   <LI>Allow the ability to use this contact information in other
   places. Users don't want to have to re-enter the same data in
   multiple places. Examples include: ability to sync with their
   Netcenter Address Book (NS), integration with AIM (NS) and the
   ability to synch with a hand held computer (Palm Pilot or
   other).<BR>
   </LI>
</UL>

<H3>Definitions</H3>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Address Book</B> - Main three pane window that allows users
   to manage their address book entries and search available LDAP
   directories. Users can create new cards, edit existing cards and
   delete cards. Users can create multiple personal address books and
   move address book cards and list between them. Users can also
   search LDAP directories, view the results in this window, and add
   those results to one of their personal address books (by Drag and
   Drop, or "Copy" and "Paste" from the "Edit" menu). The Address
   Book component is accessible from the "Tasks" menu of each of the
   components. An Address Book icon also appears on the lower left
   corner of component windows.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Bucket</B> -The bottom text field widget in the Select
   Addresses Dialog where the selected names are listed.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Card (Card Entry)</B> - A single address book entry.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Card Edit Dialog</B> - The editable dialog which displays
   the detailed information for a selected Address Book
   entry/card.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Card Pane</B> - The right bottom (in a 3 pane view) pane of
   the address book which displays the detailed information for a
   selected address book entry/card.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Results Pane</B> - The right (right top in a 3 pane view)
   pane of the address book which lists the contents of an address
   book or offline directory, or lists the search results from an
   LDAP directory.&nbsp;</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Select Addresses Dialog</B> - The modal dialog that allows
   users to select addresses for a mail compose window. Accessible
   from the Mail Compose window only.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>SideBar</B> - The left pane of the address book which lists
   the names of the Local Address Books, Mailing Lists and
   Directories available to the user.</LI>
   
   <LI><B>Synchronization (Netscape)</B> - The user's Address Book
   entries can be synchronized with a Netscape.com Web Address Book.
   If a user add/edit/deletes an entry in either Address Book, the
   results should be reflected in both Address Books.</LI>
</UL>

<P>When the Address Book is first launch within a session, the

for) items are displayed in the Results Pane. The first item in the
list is selected. When the Address Book is selected again within the
same session, the list displays the entries the user was last
viewing. For example, if the user selected a different Address book
or an entry within an Address Book, this view should be displayed
when the Address Book is again opened. &nbsp;</P>

<H3>1. Drag and Drop of Card Entries from One AB to Another</H3>

<P>Drag and drop behavior parallels that of Mail. A drag and drop of
a card entry from one Local AB to another Local AB is a Move. A Ctrl
plus drag and drop is a Copy. A drag and drop from an LDAP directory
to a Local AB is always a Copy. A drag and drop from a Local AB to an
LDAP directory, or an LDAP directory to an LDAP directory is not
permitted. The mouse cursor should provide correct visual feedback
(Move cursor vs Copy cursor vs Not Available cursor).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>2. Misc Other Stuff</H3>

<P>Bug 101484. A Mailing List is selected in the left Address Book
window pane. The user creates a New Card. The new card dialog should
indicate that the new card will be added to the parent of the
selected mailing list. Once the new card is complete, it is added to
both the selected mailing list and the parent Address Book. It is
immediately visible in the right pane which is displaying the
contents of the selected mailing list. If the user had picked a
different parent address book, the new card should appear in the
selected Address Book only.</P>

<P>Bug 103689. An Address Book in the left pane has focus. The user
initiates a New Message. The Compose window opens with the addressing
area blank. A Mailing List in left pane has focus. The user initiates
a New Message. The Compose window opens with the contents of the
mailing list in address area.</P>

<P>Selecting a particular View causes the entries in the "Name"
column to be displayed appropriately. For example, if a user choose
the View "Last, First" all entries in the "Name" column would be
displayed as Last Name, First Name. When the AB is closed and
reopened, it should remember the last view for which it was set.</P>

<P>If the user selects a View that is not available for a particular

blank. For example, the user chooses the View "Display Name" but
removed the "Display Name" for a particular AB entry from the field
in the Card Edit Dialog, nothing would be displayed for the
particular entry for the "Name" column.</P>

<P>When a Mail message is sent, name information displayed in the

<P>The column size and order is sticky.</P>

<P>An additional column, "Screen Name", is available for Netscape

<H4>Column Sorting</H4>

<P>Users should be able to sort on any column currently displayed in

sorted by that column. Additional clicks cause the sorting to toggle
between the available sorting states for that column (generally
ascending and descending).&nbsp;</P>

<P>When the user clicks on a new column, it should always be sorted
by ascending order first.</P>

<P>Mousing over a column causes a ToolTip to appear which explains

<P>Selecting an individual entry from the Results Pane, displays

<P>The Card Pane can be collapsed by dragging the separator bar
between the Results Pane and the Card Pane to the bottom of the AB
window. The Card Pane can also be hidden using the View menu.</P>

<P>The Card Pane provides the users with an easy to read, quick
summary of the information contained in a card. Fields which contain
no data are not show. Data entry fields, with or without data, are
not shown. Category headers (i.e., "Home Address") that do not have
data included with any of their associated fields are not shown. This
makes the information shown in the third pane less cluttered, more
readable and easier to find the data that is important to the user.
The user only sees the data that they chose to enter (instead of a
bunch of empty text fields).</P>

<P>The "Card for &lt;Name&gt;" should match the name format (First
Last, Last/First, Display Name) displayed in the "Name" column of the
Results Pane.</P>

<P>Users can click directly on the primary or secondary email
addresses to launch a mail message to that person (at the selected
account). The text of the email address is a link. Users can click

their default browser). The text of the web page is a link. Users can
launch an IM session by clicking on the IM screen name link (Netscape

<P>Entries from an LDAP Directory&nbsp; are NOT editable. A user can
view a card entry from a Directory within the third pane, but these
cards can not be edited. (Hence, the "Edit" menu item in the three
pane Address Book should not be enabled when a non-editable entry is
being viewed.)&nbsp;</P>

<P>The look of a non-editable card entry within the Card Pane is
slightly different (potentially more muted) than an editable entry.
This is to try and indicate to the user that this card is display
only. A button, "Add to Address Book" will appear within the Card
Pane so that users can add this entry to one of their personal
address books and have the ability to edit the entry.&nbsp; Clicking
on the "Add to Address Book" button would cause the New Card dialog
to open pre-populated with the available data. The Personal AB is the
default location.</P>

<P>If a user wants to edit a Directory entry, they must first move a
copy to one of their local address books. This can be done by
dragging and dropping it into a local address book or by clicking on
the "Add to Address Book" button on the Card Pane.</P>

<P>When a user adds a new address book card or modifies an existing
card, the "Card Edit " dialog is used. This dialog is a set of tabs
in which the user can enter information about a contact. The Card
Dialog is modal. This dialog is NOT resizable by the user. As the
user enters text in the First and Last name fields, the Display field
is automatically filled in (First Last).</P>

<H4>Contact</H4>

<P>The most important information and frequently accessed information
(Name Info, Email Info, Phone Info) is available to the user on the
first "Name" tab.</P>

<H4>Address</H4>

<P>Home and Business address information as well as web page
information can be added to the "Address" tab.</P>

<P>The "Web Page:" text field areas (Home and Work) on the "Address"
tab, contain the default text "http://". This helps the user
understand what type of information goes in this field and is most
likely the way the address they will enter will begin. If the user
pastes an address into this field the "http:" should not be
duplicated. If the user enters a web address in either of these
fields, it should be displayed appropriately in the Card View pane
under "Home" or "Work". If a user does not enter a web address in one
or both of these fields, the "http://" text should NOT appear in the
Card View pane.</P>

<H2><A NAME=NewMailing></A>E. Mailing List Dialog</H2>

<P>If a user is frequently sending email to the same group of people,
a Mailing List provides an easy way for users to send mail to that
group of recipients without having to add each recipient to a Mail
Composition window. Once a Mailing List has been set up, the user
needs only to type the name or nickname of the Mailing List within
the addressing area of a Mail Composition window and the Mailing List
name is added to the message (auto complete).&nbsp; Upon send, the
message is sent to all AB entries in the Mailing List.</P>

<P>Mailing Lists are associated with a particular Address Book and
are displayed within the Address Book Window as a sub-item of a
particular Address Book. The default Address Book is the "Personal
Address Book". Mailing lists can be associated with the "Collected
Addresses" AB.</P>

<P>A card must be in a user's Address Book to be added to a Mailing
List (associated with that AB). If a user adds an entry to a mailing
list who is not already in the user's address book, a card for that
entry is automatically added to the user's address book. If a card is
deleted from an Address Book it is automatically deleted from any
associated Mailing Lists. If an address is removed from a Mailing
List, and their is also a card in one of the user's local Address
Books, the card is NOT removed.</P>

<P><I>Future: The Mailing List Dialog is modeless. User must be able
to drag and drop between the Address Book and this dialog. Currently,
the ML dialog is modal to the AB. Issues in Bug 128124 (edit/new
address list dialog should be modal) need to be addressed in order to
make the ML dialog modeless.</I></P>

<P>This dialog is resizable and should remember the it's last size
and location.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/Group1.gif" WIDTH=434 HEIGHT=440 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT ALIGN=bottom></P>

<P>When the Mailing List dialog is opened, it should default to a
location just off the side of the Address Book, if possible (instead
of on top of the AB), so that drag and drop from the AB to the
Mailing List dialog is easier. Otherwise, users must reposition the
Mailing List or AB before they can drag and drop.</P>

<P>Users can reorder Mailing List recipients by highlighting a
recipient and using the Up and Down buttons, or they can use the
"card" icon to drag and drop the recipient to a new location in the
List.</P>

<P>When creating a new Mailing List, the name of the dialog should be
"New Mailing List". When opening an existing Mailing List, the name
of the dialog should be "Mailing List: &lt;List Name&gt;". When
opening an existing Mailing List, "Add to:" and drop down selection
list should be replaced with the static text "Location: &lt;Name of
Address Book&gt;".</P>

<P>Entries in a Mailing List are displayed and appear in a mail
message in the order in which they were added to the mailing list. We
discussed the possibility of giving users the ability to VIEW their
mailing lists <B>alphabetically</B> or by order added. But, when mail
is sent to a mailing list, recipients will always be displayed in the
mail message in the order they were added regardless of how the user
choose to view the entries. Since order in which addresses are
displayed in a message is very important to certain people (signifies
a level of importance), it was thought that it might be deceiving to
users if they could see their mailing list in alphabetical order, but
weren't aware that the order in the sent message would be
different.</P>

<P>A mailing list name must be unique to its Address Book Mailing
lists appear in the left pane under their parent Address Book.</P>

<P>Email Address Collection is a feature which gathers the names
and/or email addresses from messages which the user has received or
sent and stores them in a specified Address Book, the "Collected
Addresses" AB.</P>

<P>Note: Post NS7/Moz 1.1, the "Collected Addresses" AB is no longer
the default. The PAB is the default but users can choose which AB
they want to collect to. Also, only outgoing email addresses are
collected by default.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/ABhist1.gif" WIDTH=173 HEIGHT=120 BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom></P>

<P>It is intended that this feature will provide convenience for
people who want addresses automatically added to an Address Book, or
for people who want to contact someone who once sent them email but
for which they do not remember a specific name/address.</P>

<P>The "Collected Addresses" AB should behave the same as any other
address book.&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Details:</H3>

<UL>
   <LI>Addresses are added to the "Collected Addresses" AB when a
   user <B>views</B> a message (not when message are received) and
   when the user <B>sends</B> an outgoing message (type down
   addressing also autocompletes against email addresses themselves,
   and not just correct name info)..</LI>
   
   <LI>Users has the option to have addresses added for Incoming
   messages (default = on), Outgoing messages (default = on) and/or
   Newsgroup messages (default = off).&nbsp;</LI>
   
   <LI>When messages are viewed, the "From" entry is added to the
   "Collected Addresses" AB. When messages are sent, entries are
   added from the "To", "Cc" and "Bcc" fields.</LI>
   
   <LI>Duplicate entries in the "Collected Addresses" AB will not be
   added. The primary email address is used to determine duplicate
   addresses. An entry CAN be both in the "Collected Addresses" AB
   and other Local Address Books.</LI>
   
   <LI>Mail will ship with two default Address Books, "Personal
   Address Book" and "Collected Addresses" AB.</LI>
   
   <LI>The "Collected Addresses" AB will be by default
   associated/attached to the Email Address Collection feature.</LI>
   
   <LI>Users can NOT change which Address Book is associated/attached
   to the Email Address Collection feature.</LI>
   
   <LI>The "Collected Addresses" AB can be synched with a Netscape
   Web Address Book (Netscape only).</LI>
   
   <LI>Users can not change the name of the "Collected Addresses"
   AB.</LI>
   
   <LI>Users can delete the Collected Addresses Address Book. Doing
   so would cause the Address Collection feature to be turned off in
   Preferences.&nbsp; If a user goes to Preferences and turns this
   feature back on, the Collected Addresses&nbsp; AB would be
   recreated the first time it was needed.</LI>
   
   <LI>If only the email of a sender is available (a First or Last
   name is not included) the sender will be added to the "Collected
   Addresses" AB and the information to the left of the @ symbol
   (<B>phil</B>@netscape.com) will be added to the Display Name
   field. If an email message from this same sender is then received
   at a later date and a First, Last or Display Name is now included,
   this information will be merged together with the existing card
   entry for this email address. A duplicate entry is not created,
   nor is the user prompted with a confirmation dialog. This data
   merge ONLY occurs if there currently is no value set for First or
   Last name.</LI>
   
   <LI>The "Collected Addresses" AB is included in autocomplete
   addressing, but it is the last local address book to be checked.
   If a user is actively using another personal address book, there
   is a greater chance that a correct match will be found first in
   this personal address book that the "Collected Addresses" AB.</LI>
   
   <LI>The Addressing/Address Book area of the Preferences will
   contain a place where users can enter domain names for which if a
   sender belongs to, he/she will NOT be added to the "Collected
   Addresses" AB.</LI>
   
   <LI>By default, the Email Address Collection feature will be
   turned on. Users can turn this feature off within the
   Addressing/Address Book area of Preferences.</LI>
   
   <LI>The default size limit of the Collected Address Book is 700
   entries. Once the size limit is reached, when a new entry is added
   an old entry is removed, using LRU (least recently used) logic. If
   it has to remove cards, it tries to remove the older ones
   first.</LI>
   
   <LI>The performance of the "Collected Addresses" AB decreases the
   larger it gets. There is a preference that will limit the size of
   the Collected Addresses AB.</LI>
