Background</p>
      </b>    
<p>LDAP Replication is a process where a directory is replicated onto the
  local machine to enable access to data in case if there is no server connection.
  </p>
          
<p>The LDAP replication support we would provide in Mozilla / Netscape 6 is
for replicating any People / corporate Addresses kinda directories onto the
local machine in a local Address Book supported Mork database.</p>
          
<p>Netscape 4.x provides support for LDAP replication using LDAP SDK to get
 the entries for replication and stores the data locally in the Address Book
 neomagic DB that it supports. It provides an offline panel for  each directory
 to allow the user to set a preference to sync the directory  automatically
 when the user selects to go offline as well as provide a button  to sync
the directory instantaneously.</p>
          
<p>For the initial version of LDAP support we will provide support for replicating
  the directory instantaneously.</p>
      <b>    
<p>Replication Protocols: LCUP and Change Log</p>
     </b><font size="2"> </font>    
<p>There is a couple of standard replication draft protocols called the Change
 Log  protocol and LCUP (LDAP Client Update Protocol) which can be used for
 implementing  replication. Although LCUP is the later one, most present
day  servers do not comply with it yet.</p>
     <font size="2"> </font>    
<p>Servers implementing LCUP protocol provide a cookie to the client containing
  the state information for the client. For each replication search call
the   client sends back this cookie and the server takes care of returning
only   the changes done on the server after the last replication from the
client.   There is much more to this protocol but we will not go too much
into details  of this since we would not be implementing LCUP in the initial
version. See <a href="http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ldup-lcup-02.txt">
  LCUP Internet draft</a>
   for details.</p>
          
<p>The Change Log protocol works on the basis of a change log. The server
  has a container which contains a list of changeLog entries. Each change
log  entry contains an incremental unique changelog number and the details
of the entry, change type and the changes done to the entry. This container
is obtained by reading the "changeLog" attribute of the server’s root DSE.
The client retrieves all the changeLog entries with a changeLog number equal
to and greater than its last replicated changeLog number for a directory.
If the  equal to entry is not returned the entire directory needs to be replicated.
 See <a href="http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-good-ldap-changelog-03.txt">
 Change Log Internet Draft</a>
   for more details.</p>
          
<p>In Netscape 4x the Change Log protocol was implemented to do LDAP replication. 
 </p>
   
<p>Although we will not be implementing the LCUP protocol for the initial 
 version we will try to separate out the implementation of making the actual 
 query for replication and the processing of the query results for replication. 
 The two protocols for getting the changes are quite different but this will 
 help us to reuse the results processing for replication, which involves parsing
 the results and saving it in the local Address Book Mork database, whatever
 may be the protocol implemented. We would also try to figure out a way to
 query the server, before beginning the initial replication (downloading all
 entries) for a directory, to find out what is the replication protocol supported
 by the server for that directory.</p>
    <b>    
<p>Alternative Replication Methodology</p>
     </b>     
<p>Another alternative to using the standard protocol as suggested by Mark 
 Smith is to use the time stamps for replicating. The client stores the time 
 stamp of the last update for the directory and at the time of replication 
 compare the last update time stamp for the entries on the server. If the 
time stamp on the server is later the entry in the client is updated with 
the one on the server.</p>
          
<p>This methodology does not require the server to do anything special to
  support replication except maintain the last update time stamp attribute,
  which all servers do, as well as allow access to this attribute so that
the  client can compare its last update time stamp for the entries. One issue
 is if the naming convention for this operational attribute on the LDAP servers
  is standard, i.e. is the last update time stamp attribute called the same
  on all servers ? </p>
          
<p>On the other hand this Does have an impact on performance since at the
  time of replication each entry’s timestamp needs to be compared to decide
  which entries in the client side needs to be updated. Where as in the case
  of the Change Log protocol only the list of changelog entries need to be
 accessed.</p>
          
<p>Also for new records or deleted records or records whose RDN have been
  updated the processing might require to resync the complete directory.
But  even if this is done it needs to be known when or how often the resync
needs  to be done.</p>
          
<p></p>
       
<p><b>Authentication</b></p>
     
<p>For the above replication protocols one issue that needs to be considered 
 is authentication. For the ChangeLog protocol the user need to be able to 
 access the change log container or the "changeLog" attribute of the RootDSE. 
 Also even if there is access to this container, all attributes of this container 
 should be allowed access. For the alternative methodology we need to be able
 to access the last updateTimestamp operational attribute for the directory 
 as well as the server needs to be indexed on this by the administrator for 
 effective server side processing for replication.</p>
     
<p>Maybe to deal with the changeLog situation the administrator should define 
 a replication user authDN and password that can be used to access the Change 
 Log entries. But maybe prefs is not a good place to store this sensitive
 information ! We should look more into the implementation done in 4x in
this regard and see if that is the most effective way to deal with authentication.  
</p>
 
<p>A better way to deal with this is to make use of the Password Manager /
Wallet feature in Mozilla / Netscape 6 to store the authDN and password used
for LDAP replication. This would however require auto-config integration with
the Password Manager.</p>
 
<p>Also it seems like the search for accessing the change log container can
 be done by any user however the "changes" attribute can not be accessed.
To take care of this 4x makes another search to retrieve all the attributes
for the entries from the change log and then replaces the record for these
entries with the retrieved attributes data. This may have some performance
impact since otherwise the modified attributes can be directly accessed without 
retrieving the entries again.<br>
 </p>
     
<p><b>Preferences</b></p>
     
<p>Various user and company specific preferences and details can be specified 
 for replication :<br>
   - Restricting the replication to what the user needs is a good way to
keep  the replication time under check. Each user should be allowed to specify 
a search filter so that only the entries useful for him/her are downloaded.<br>
   - replication search base for replication search<br>
   - lastChangeNumber / last updatedTimestamp<br>
- configuration file for field mappings associated with the directory<br>
- replication search timeout</p>
     
<p>The autocomplete using LDAP, stores several directory properties and stores 
the information in the preferences. The code that reads these preferences 
or definitly the directory preferences can be reused for getting the LDAP 
properties to do the search for replication.<br>
   </p>
   
<p> </p>
   
<p>  <b>Mapping AB fields to LDAP attributes</b></p>
   
<p>The LDAP attributes needs to be mapped on to the AB fields / AB card.
Each corporate customer can have separate attribute names for the People
details directory attributes. There is a mapping proposed on bug # 118454
and related bugs. These bugs also deal with cases of multi valued attributes,
multiple LDAP attribute names mapping to AB field, etc.</p>
   
<p>Maybe a configuration file should be defined which specifies this mapping
 which can be used at runtime to do the search as well as process the search
 results. There could be a differnet configuration file for each directory
server. This configuration file should be allowed to be updated by the administrator
 depending on what attribute names are used by the corporate client and distributed
 maybe using autoconfig. Maybe a configuration UI can be provided to configure 
this mapping as part of the N6x MCD version !</p>
 
<p>The current strategy should however be to have a centralized class with 
the existing code for this hardcoded map which can at a later stage be changed 
to use a configuration file.<br>
 </p>
   
<p><b>Storing the entries locally</b><br>
  </p>
   
<p>The Address Book uses the mork database to store its data locally. We
will go ahead with using the Mork databse since it will allow us to use existing
 Address Book XPCOM interfaces for our implementation. Maybe Berkley DB could
 be another option which may result into better performance but this may
require  some more coding even for the Address Book UI to display the data
as well as will only have a performance gain only during LDAP replication
of a complete directory which is a rarer event for a user.</p>
