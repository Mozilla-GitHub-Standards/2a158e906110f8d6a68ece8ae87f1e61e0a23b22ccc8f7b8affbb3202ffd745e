<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Junk
Mail Purging</span><br>
<a href="mailto:sspitzer@mozilla.org">Seth Spitzer</a><br>
</div>
for testing, use these:<br>
<br>
NSPR_LOG_FILE=c:\purgelog.txt<br>
NSPR_LOG_MODULES=MsgPurge:5<br>
<br>
user_pref("mail.purge.min_delay",5);  (default is 480 minutes, or 8
hours)<br>
user_pref("mail.purge.timer_interval",1); (default is 5 minutes)<br>
<br>
timer_interval is how often we check to see if something is ready to be
purged<br>
min_delay is, for a given folder, has it been long enough since our
last purge?<br>
<br>
let's say I had two accounts, pop and imap, both with their own junk
folders, both with purge enabled.<br>
<br>
here's how this should work:<br>
<br>
startup<br>
<br>
five minutes later:<br>
&nbsp; look for something to purge<br>
&nbsp; find pop junk folder, never been purged, purge it.<br>
&nbsp; set lastPurgeTime for that folder to now.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
five minutes later:<br>
&nbsp; look for something to purge<br>
&nbsp; see that pop junk folder was purged 5 minutes ago (which is not
more than 8 hours), so skip it.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; find imap junk folder, never been purged, purge it.<br>
<br>
five minutes<br>
&nbsp; look for something to purge<br>
&nbsp; see that pop junk folder was purged 10 minutes ago (which is not
more than 8 hours), so skip it.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;  see that imap junk folder was purged 5 minutes ago (which is
not more than 8 hours), so skip it.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
five minutes later:<br>
&nbsp; look for something to purge<br>
&nbsp; see that pop junk folder was purged 15 minutes ago (which is not
more than 8 hours), so skip it.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;  see that imap junk folder was purged 10 minutes ago (which is
not more than 8 hours), so skip it.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
five minutes later:<br>
&nbsp; look for something to purge<br>
&nbsp; see that pop junk folder was purged 485 minutes ago (which IS
more than 8 hours), purge it.<br>
&nbsp; set lastPurgeTime for that folder to now.<br>
<br>
five minutes later:<br>
&nbsp; look for something to purge<br>
&nbsp; see that pop junk folder was purged 5 minutes ago (which is not
more than 8 hours), so skip it.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; see that pop junk folder was purged 485 minutes ago (which IS
more than 8 hours), purge it.<br>
&nbsp; set lastPurgeTime for that folder to now.<br>
<br>
Because lastPurgeTime is stored on the folder, if you exit and restart
in there, it should not matter.<br>
<br>
(Note, without min_delay (or if min_delay is &lt; timer_interval),
you'd just keep purging the same folder over and over, and never get to
the other folders.)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">More info:</span><br>
<br>
every mail.purge.timer_interval minutes (starting when mail accounts
are loaded), looping through all accounts and<br>
<br>
find the first server that:<br>
<ul>
  <li> can get incoming messages (if you can't, we don't bother, since
this type of account won't show up in the JMC)</li>
  <li> and is enabled to do purging</li>
  <li> and has a valid junk folder that exists</li>
  <li> and hasn't been purged in mail.purge.min_delay minutes.</li>
  <li> and isn't busy (like if this was a pop account, and we were
getting new mail)</li>
  <li> and if we require authentication to open the junk folder (like on
imap) </li>
  <li>and we're authenticated</li>
</ul>
<br>
if we find one, we stop looking and search that folder for any messages
older than the per-JMC purge interval.<br>
<br>
on the search results, we only delete messages that are marked as junk.<br>
we do this by checking the junkscore attribute on the msgHdr (which is
stored in the .msf file)<br>
<br>
It would have been more efficient to have done:<br>
"search for all messages older than n days that are junk."<br>
But we can't do it that way, because not all IMAP servers support that
kind of search.<br>
So, instead, we search for "all messages older than n days", and only
delete the messages that are marked as junk.<br>
They are marked as junk in the .msf file (msg db).<br>
<br>
now update when that account was last purged.  (this is stored on the
junk mail <br>
folder, so if the junk mail folder is shared, we do the right thing)<br>
<br>
we only purge one account per timer firing.<br>
<br>
if I have 5 accounts that are set up for purging, <br>
it will take 5 timer firing to get to them all. <br>
(the purge service can only do one at a time.)<br>
<br>
Because the last purge time is stored on the folder, the
"mail.purge.min_delay" interval should work across sessions.
