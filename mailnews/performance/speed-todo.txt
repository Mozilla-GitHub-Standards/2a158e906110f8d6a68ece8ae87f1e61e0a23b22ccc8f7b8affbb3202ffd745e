known issues, problems, with the MailNews_Performance_20010208_BRANCH branch

Must fix for landing:

2) fix crash on exit

3) Crash when clicking Sidebar Tabs button.  I don't know why this would be because of us,
but it apparently doesn't happen in the 2/8 trunk build.

4) Crash when switching folders.  This happened to me twice when running a build from 3/5 11:30pm.
I don't know what I did to cause this.

5) divide by zero crasher in nsOutlinerBodyFrame (hyatt?)

crash if I try to scroll the thread pane before (while?) a folder is loading.
    #0  0x41496b53 in nsOutlinerBodyFrame::PositionChanged (this=0x8745a04,
    aOldIndex=67, aNewIndex=@0xbfffdb34) at nsOutlinerBodyFrame.cpp:1253

    rh is 0, SIGFPE.  it's the same old divide by zero crash, since rh == 0

Other issues:

2) remove these files from the tree, makefiles, .mcp, and factories, and CIDs

added:

3) test outlook compose import

5) commandglue.js, fix LoadMessageByUri(uri) not to use RDF (no more message datasource) 

7) fix "View | Sort By | ..." to do the right thing with check box state

8) remove "pad" from sort code (don't use sizeof)

9) remove "len" from sort code, unless doing a collation key based sort

10) remove extra copies when creating collation keys (log bug on nhotta)

11) better guesses for allocating block of memory for collation key sort

12) purify for memory leaks

13) file / copy, d&d from search (gayatrib + sspitzer)

14) Fix initial thread sort order to be ascending

16) remove all the printfs / dump statements we added

18) implement sort unread thread count, implement sort thread total
(currently prints "fix me" and doesn't sort.)

19) Arrow for ascending/descending order of column is brought from previously
 selected folder (example Folder 1 sorts by Date, change to folder 2 and sort by Sender,
 change to folder 3 and sort by Subject.  Now go back to Folder one and you will see the
 sort order arrow on all three column headers.

20) disable sort by thread for search pane

21) if you expand a thread above the current selection, selection stays at the same index.
it should changes, (we need to restore selection after expansion)

22) expand thread / collapse thread

24) clean up SearchDialog.js (gayatrib)

25) opening links from mail sometimes leaves me with about:blank instead of the url

26) undoing a delete, leaves selection out of sync with the displayed message

27) Deleting message sometimes causes the outliner to jump around a bit

29) Trouble with folder hierarchy dropdowns sticking (remnants of  nested subfolder sections)
often when using search messages scope dropdown. Must close search and try again.

31) Scroll to first new message in folder. (sspitzer)

32) After sorting or going into threaded mode, we should retain the selection and open
up a thread if the selected message is the child of that thread.

33) Delete doesn't update the unread/total count at the bottom right corner of the 3 pane

34) Standalone message window context menu problems (what are these?)

35) If no message is loaded in the message pane, you select all, and then you sort, we load a message.

36) fix problems with d&d for multiple 3 pane (sspitzer)

37) cross folder navigation:  when landing in new folder, we don't select the message.  (related to #38) (sspitzer)

38) land putterman's "don't land on the trash folder when navigating" patch on the branch (sspitzer)

39) verify that .newsrc overrides the .msf file (thanks to hwaara and bienvenu for pointing this out) (sspitzer)

40) add MarkAllRead to the folder pane context menu (sspitzer)

41) make sure #Move, #Copy, etc still all work for folder datasource [and that I didn't break anything] (sspitzer)

43) js error, need to check dbview when populating the "View | Messages | ..." menu. (bienvenu)

44) fix menus to not be enabled if in account central (or none of the sub menus are enabled.  (as top level as possible)  Examples:  Message | Mark, View | Messages, View | Sort By, etc.

46) switch themes crasher (could be fixed on the trunk, testing a potential fix in my [sspitzer] tree)

47) theme switching problems with outliner (go from modern to modern to test). (bug logged on hyatt for the trunk)

48) When forwarding a mail with Ja subject, if you add some Ja chars before the forwarded subject,
   the space between "Fwd:" and the original subject is displayed as a square. 

49) When the thread pane can display all the message headers then the scroll bar should disappear.
 Currently the scroll bar remains although the widget to move the focus up or down is not present.
 The folder pane works as expected. 

53)(already known, mentioned by Ninoschka?)  need visual indicators for Watched, Killed threads.
54) reply to a collapsed thread , click Get Msg causes topic message to change/show you as sender.

   1. select collapsed news thread, topic message is from someone else
   2. reply, send reply
   3. still on collapsed thread, Get Msg.
   4. Now the sender column shows you as the sender (thread still collapsed, shows you as sender for topic message)
55) Crash when switch to empty watched threads with unread and click in thread pane. 
56) I don't see that kill thread works.  If I use Kill Thread on a topic message then send a reply to the thread, new reply is new/unread/bold and navigation will take you to that message.  Shouldn't if kill works, correct?
58) Get Msg selects new message instead of leaving thread pane selection on current selected message:

   1. Threaded mode or flat sort by date, newest messages at top of thread pane.
   2. Select top message in thread pane.
   3. Send yourself a message, Get Msg.
   4. When new message arrives, thread pane selection jumps to new message. (Note the message pane contents are left at previous selection.)  Should not jump to new selection; should remain at currently selected message.  (Also note, Next unread won't work now if that's the only new/unread message. User has to select something else then reselect the new message.)
59)Navigation via NextUnread button in standalone message window crashes in news when firing quickly..

   1. Open a newsgroup with quite a few unread messages.
   2. Open the first message in thread pane to a standalone message window.
   3. In the standalone message window, click Next button, again, again... usually by the 3rd-4th Next a crash occurs. (Note: not sure if this may be due to the problem where throbber/barberpole never stops).
 
60) linux only:  next button doesn't work in the stand alone message window until I click in the message body.  (sspitzer)

??) land back on the trunk

maybe some day:

1) fix subscribe dialog to use the outliner

2) fix the folder pane to use the outliner (on top of RDF, piggybacking off of what they do for bookmarks?)

4) other commands in the search dialog:  mark all read, etc.

5) fix the address book to use outliner (needed for performance on day, think about a giant LDAP addressbook)

FIXED:

1) 3/1 Fix inserting headers into flat views sorted by subject/sender 
(insert location is incorrect) (bienvenu)
2) 3/1 Undo delete marks the message as unread 
3) 3/1 implement toggle thread killed (in nsMsgDBView.cpp)
4) 3/1 implement toggle thread watched (in nsMsgDBView.cpp)
6) 3/1 Delete, move/copy messages between pop folders are not working.
9) 3/2 default sort order should be date, newest last.  
13) 3/4 Delete from thread / message pane context menu
14) 3/4 expand all / collapse all (you need expand all for select all, in threaded mode)
16) 3/5 forwarding a message broken (won't allow me to add an address) (ducarroz)
18) 3/5 collapse all threads leaves '+' next to threads with 1 message
19) 3/5 message display performance, improve command enabling / updating architecture. (mscott)
20) 3/5 toolbar disabled on the first message I select
21) 3/5 Snapping message pane open doesn't load newly selected content.
26) 3/5 dragging (and moving) a message doesn't display the next message after the move.
27) 3/5 editing a draft causes us to lose the addresses.  (ducarroz) Works For Me, wrong alert!
28) 3/5 fix account central problems with message display
29) 3/5 cross folder navigation, add back support for "mailnews.nav_crosses_folders"
30) 3/5 remove message data source and all the commands, like http://home.netscape.com/NC-rdf#Move, #ReallyDelete, #Delete, #Copy, #Download*, etc.
31) 3/6 File | Empty Trash for an IMAP account causes crash.
32) 3/6 Mark a message unread, switch folders and then switch back. The original message you marked unread will
 now be read. This only happened in IMAP.  The same happens when marking a message read and switching.
33) 3/6 Mark a thread child as unread.  See the parent's count go up.  Now select that child message and the parent's
count stays the same. If I cause the window to repaint, the count is correct.
34) 3/6 threaded menu item doesn't change to threaded mode.
35) 3/6 If you are threaded and then choose the unread view it removes the threaded mode and just shows a flat view.
36) 3/6 mark all read
37) 3/6 land mozilla/gfx changes on the trunk
38) 3/7 remove nsIMsgFolder from the Navigate interface, we do it from JS now. 
39) 3/7 fix IsSpecialFolderSelected() in threadPane.js (we don't need RDF to do that) 
40) 3/7 stand alone message window navigation (mscott)
41) 3/7 Window title isn't correct in the standalone or the 3 pane
42) 3/7 Fix level of promoted messages when deleting top message in an expand 
thread.
43) 3/7 Multiple delete doesn't select the correct next message
44) 3/7 No focus ring for thread pane
45) 3/7 Tabbing doesn't change focus.
46) 3/7 + / - stay on message even when all children are deleted
47) 3/7 fixed JS errors when click on menus when in account central (forget to check gDBView)
48) 3/7 Delete/File from standalone message window not working.  I will act differently than in 6.01, since we have stand alone message navigation. (mscott?)
49) 3/7 On 3 pane, when switching folders, message view pane doesn't get refreshed. 
50) 3/11 sort by sender performance, nsMsgHdr::GetAuthorCollationKey(), cache the mime converter (bienvenu)
51) 3/11 convert commands to go through the db view, instead of the message datasource: 
mark thread read, download selected messages, download flagged messages, mark all read
(bienvenu)
52) 3/11 fix "View | Messages | ..." to do the right thing with check box state (bienvenu)
53) 3/11 allow the user to mark a message read or flagged from the search pane (by clicking on the diamond or the flag)
54) 3/11 Fix bugs unread messages only in threaded view (if QA is reading this and you have examples
send to me and I will add to the list)
55) 3/11 Ignore/Watch Threads
- With a news message selected, the Message menu displays "Kill Thread" and "Watch Thread"
- Select Message|Watch Thread and no Watch icon appears (known issue)
* Select View|Messages|Watched Threads with Unread displays nothing in the thread or message pane 
56) Stand Alone Window
- Next button works
- Go|Next menus work
- Go|Previous menus work
* Go|Next and Go|Previous accelerators don't work when the window first opens. I have to select a menu item such as Go|Next|Message then I can use the accelerators.
59) 3/12 news://host/group?list-ids urls work!
60) 3/12 Select View|Headers|All and the current message is not reloaded.
- Select a message so that Normal headers are displayed
* Select View|Headers|All and notice that the current message still diplays in normal mode
- Select another message and it now displays all the headers
- Select the original message and it also displays all the headers 
61) 3/12 use a string bundle for the hard coded strings (mscott?)
62) 3/12 command updating in SearchDialog.js (currently, "Open" is always enabled) (mscott: I implemented command updating in the search pane the other week)
64) news regressions fixed
65) Loading document barber pole never finishes for news messages, must click Stop
30) 3/15 Thread pane selection doesn't turn grey when thread pane loses focus (fixed on merged tip build)
