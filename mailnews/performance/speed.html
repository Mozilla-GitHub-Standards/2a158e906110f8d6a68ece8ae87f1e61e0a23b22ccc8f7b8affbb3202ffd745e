<h2>
Introduction</h2>
Dave Hyatt recently suffered a bout of true inspiration and came up with
a way to make a skinnable outliner widget that only knows "how to paint"
and not reflow. This outliner widget behaves much like the 4.x outliner
widget. A client implements a view that is bound to the outliner widget.
The widget then asks the view for information like the row properties for
the current rows it is currently painting. We believe that performance
on the same order of magnitude as 4.x can be achieved using this outliner
widget in mailnews for the following areas:
<ul>
<li>
folder loading</li>

<li>
scrolling</li>

<li>
time to bring up a new mail window</li>

<li>
selection speed</li>

<li>
sorting</li>

<li>
executing commands like deleting multiple messages</li>
</ul>
In addition we would be making a substantial reduction in the amount of
memory consumed by mailnews because loading a folder will no longer involve
building a content model for all the messages in the data source.
<p>Of course there's a cost to contrast all these gains. Using this new
outliner widget would requiire us to completely re-write the mailnews front
end. We would no longer be using RDF as the view for data in the thread
pane. We would no longer be using the tree widet for the thread pane either.
This document is intended to summarize the work we would need to do to
convert mailnews to use this outliner widget. Hopefully by writing it,
we'll also be able to figure out any XP Toolkit dependencies we would need
in addition to just the outliner widget.
<h2>
The Outliner Widget</h2>
A consumer of the outliner widget implements <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/layout/xul/base/src/outliner/public/nsIOutlinerView.idl">nsIOutlinerView</a>
which contains methods like get selection, get row properties, get cell
properties, is container, is open etc. So it is the responsibility of the
view to manage selection, and to provide properties and values for row
and cell values in the outliner. The view talks to the outliner via <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/layout/xul/base/src/outliner/public/nsIOutlinerBoxObject.idl">nsIOutlinerBoxObject</a>
which allows the view to invalidate rows and cells or append rows. So the
view actually tells the outliner when to invalidate rows or regions. It
also fills in the information for each row the outliner is currently displaying.
<p>Over time, we'll try to include or point to some example code showing
you how to write a view for an outliner.
<h2>
Outliner Views for MailNews</h2>
The following section attempts to list and describe the changes we need
to make to the mailnews front end in order to use an outliner in the thread
pane. For now, let's focuse on the thread pane and leave the folder data
source alone. Time permitting we will attempt to conver the folder pane
to use an outliner widget as well.
<p>The first thing we need to do is to rebuild a view layer for mailnews.
Currently RDF acts as our view and this is going to go away. Where is our
view level going to live? One could easily implement nsIOutlinerView on
each mailnews folder class. Methods like getRow properties would be easy
to write when you can talk directly to a DBFolder.&nbsp; However, then
the view and the model are the same and you can't really have multiple
view of a folder. So clearly that isn't desireable. In 4.x, we had MSG_ViewIndices
which you could use to map between a particular view and the actual entries
in the data base. Operations like sorting and such were performed on the
view indices. Let's assume we bring over something similar to the view
indices. Some mailnews view issues
<ul>
<li>
Do we have just one outliner view implemenation class or do we need one
per each type of folder (imap, news, local)? In 4.x we had</li>

<li>
When you switch a folder are we going to create a new view implementation
object or attempt to reuse the existing one (clearing out the view and
re-initializing it)</li>

<li>
We need a notion of view indices which can be used to map selections and
what's currently being showin in the outliner to DB entries.</li>
</ul>
David Bienvenu added the following very helpful description of 4.x:
<p>In 4.x a view contained three separate parallel arrays: the msg key
array, the flags array (single byte), and the level array (which indicated
the level of nesting). Each array was kept in order with the view. The
view object listened to the DB that it was a view of, and when db notifications
were received, updated the view appropriately, which in turn would notify
the front end (in this case, the outliner). Since we're still sending notifications
from the DB in 6.0, this should be easy enough to do.
<p>There were separate view classes, however, for threaded views, and the
threads with new view. The view is the class that builds up the content,
so it makes sense for the different views to be different classes.&nbsp;
The hierarchy was msgdbvw (which handled flat views), thrdbvw for threaded
view, and thrnewvw for threads with new.
<p>Many things in the MailFE will have to be re-written to work using the
outliner widget. The following sub sections include descriptions of some
of these including what we'll need to do in the new world.
<h4>
Command Handling</h4>
We'll need to implement new command handling that won't rely on RDF. Something
similar to 4.x where we intepret the command and the selection and perform
the operation. This includes things like deleting, etc. I'm assuming there
will be some xp toolkit dependencies here
<h4>
Drag and Drop</h4>
We'll need drag and drop support in the outliner widget. Another xp toolkit
dependency. Dave said pinkerton might be willing to help us out here. We'll
need to invesigate this further.
<h4>
Sorting</h4>
We will no longer be going through the rdf xul sort service to perform
sorting. We'll need to do it on our own. This should improve performance
for sorting as well! We need to make sure to watch out for any I18N issues
RDF may have been taking care for us already when we do this.Where does
the sorting code live? I'm assuming we'll always just be sorting a view.
<h4>
Search</h4>
Currently the search front end leverages the fact that we use RDF. i.e.
it is built out of a data source as well. In addition the search results
pane is just a thread pane instance so it will need to use the outliner
widget as well. This could be a lot of work. Gayatri is already working
on new search features built out of the current search FE. If we obsolete
this we need to get her involved in the loop early on.
<h4>
Implementing Threads</h4>
We will have to revist how we implemented message threads in the thread
pane. We'll also need some XP-toolkit help to implement the abiliity to
show a "connected-ness" between messages in the same thread. In 4.x, this
meant&nbsp; those little dotted lines that went from the parent message
to the next message in the thread, to the next message, etc. We'll need
a way to describe this with the outliner.
<h4>
Context Menu</h4>
We'll need to revisit how we build the context menu for the thread pane.
Is there a toolkit dependency here or is this something we implement on
our own?
<h4>
View Navigation</h4>
Putterman reminded me that we'll need to rewrite our view navigation code
as this code currently uses RDF and the DOM. By doing it ourselves we'll
be able to make things like show previous work again which we couldn't
do through RDF.
<h4>
Batching APIs for our Store</h4>
Now that we have total control over the view we want to batch updates and
changes in the selection for the outliner widget. For instance, making
sure we properly batch deletes when it comes to removing the selected items
from the view. We may not have to do much here as I think our folder notifications
for operations like delete are already batched.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Open Issues / Where to go?</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Whose going to do what work?</li>

<li>
Working out the XP Toolkit dependencies</li>

<li>
Working with hyatt to help educate us on how to write our style rules for
the outliner and how to interact with the outliner</li>

<li>
Do we make branch for mailnews or for the whole tree?</li>

<li>
What about the folder pane data source? Do we get rid of it too?</li>

<ul>
<li>
could improve performance</li>

<li>
allow us to re-order accounts (currently RDF forces alphabetical order)</li>

<li>
could simplify much of our folder command logic and selection management</li>
</ul>
</ul>
