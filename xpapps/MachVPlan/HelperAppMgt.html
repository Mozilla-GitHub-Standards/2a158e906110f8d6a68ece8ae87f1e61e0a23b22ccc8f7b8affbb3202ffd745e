<h1 id="#B5">Improve Helper Application Management</h1>
 
<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
 
<p>This set of features relate to the "Helper Applications" preference panel. 
            </p>
<p>The "features" listed under this line item can be categorized as follows: 
                </p>
<ul>
  <li>Helper Applications Pref panel feature(s)                         
    <p>Specifically, "reflecting" OS-defined helper applications.       
             </p>
  </li>
  <li>Profile Manager feature(s)                         
    <p>Specifically, "importing" settings from 4.x.                     </p>
  </li>
  <li>Making it work the way it is supposed to                         
    <p>Specifically, "reflecting" registered helper apps and user       
                    decisions, and "Fix bugs."                 </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Re: Making it work the way it is supposed to             </p>
<p>This is bug fixing and not addressed by this plan.             </p>
<p>Re: Automatically import settings from 4.x:             </p>
<p>The only place this can happen is when migrating a 4.x profile, or, optionally
when                creating a new profile.  It can apply in the latter case
because the Communicator                settings are actually stored on a
per-machine (or per-Windows-user) basis so we                could extract
that information for every new profile, not just ones explicitly        
       "copied" from a specific Communicator profile.             </p>
<p>Regardless, this is a Profile Manager feature and will not be addressed
by this                plan.             </p>
<p>Re: Helper Applications Pref Panel feature(s)             </p>
<p>The current implementation of this panel is based on the mimetypes.rdf
file,                which contains only browser-specific helper application
entries.  Currently,                this information is manipulated as a
generic RDF datasource, by code in 3                places:             
   </p>
<ul>
  <li>the URILoader                     </li>
  <li>the Helper Application prefs panel (and related dialogs)          
          </li>
  <li>the "download dialog", aka "unknown content dialog" (nsIHelperAppLauncherDialog 
                        implementation)                 </li>
</ul>
<p>To merge the OS-defined settings, we need to create a new RDF data source 
               that encapsulates the OS settings (requires separate implementation
for each                platform), and another datasource that merges that
new one with current mimeTypes.rdf                data.             </p>
<p>This feature is the only work addressed by this plan (and the detailed
Task and                Issues lists, below).         </p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>
The solution to this problem must provide the additional functionality
(display the "inherited" OS mime-type/helper-app settings in the
helper app pref panel), and, resolve some of the more irksome problems
with the current implementation of this area of Mozilla.
</p>
<p>Those issues include:
<ol>
<li>Too many dependencies on the mimeTypes.rdf implementation
<p>
There are at least 3 sets of code that have hard dependencies on
mimeTypes.rdf, and, that duplicate, to some extent, the logic that
maintains that data source.  At a minimum, we should consolidate that
code.  It would be nice to go the extra step and consolidate it behind
a higher-level interface that hides the RDF implementation detail.
</p>
<li>Download dialog dependency on prefs
<p>
Currently, the "Advanced..." button on the download dialog (the one that
asks if you want to open the file or save it to disk) opens the same
Helper App "edit/new type" dialog as does the Helper App pref panel
(via the New/Edit buttons).  The problem in general is that this is
an awkward dependency.  The pref panel is an application-specific UI
component while the download dialog is part of the "core" of Mozilla
(a peer to the uriloader).  This is a real issue for embedding, because
this dependency makes it hard to draw a line around the "embeddable"
Mozilla which includes the download dialog (at least the default
.xul implementation of that interface).  We need to move the code that
the Advanced... button triggers into a "lower level" component (and
separate it via an interface so that embedders can replace it with
their own UI).
</p>
<li>Discrepancies between the "New Type" and "Edit Type" dialogs
<p>
The "New Type" helper app dialog doesn't let you say "[don't] always ask me"
for the new mime type.  The Edit Type dialog doesn't let you change the
description for the mime type.  I think there only needs to be 1 dialog,
with an input argument that specifies which mode it is in (and to control
things like not changing the mime type when invoked from the download
dialog).  We should try to resolve these problems when we transition the
implementation from the helper app pref panel.
</p>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
If we examine the 3 "clients" of the helper application information
in Mozilla (the pref panel, the uriloader, and the download dialog),
the requirements are:
<ol>
<li>to get helper app info for a given mime type (or file extension)
<li>to enumerate the list of mime types
<li>to add "helper app information" for new mime types
<li>to modify the info stored for a given mime type
<li>to have the OS-defined mappings from mime-type to helper app
to show up automagically
<li>to have user-defined (via prefs) helper app settings to overlay
the OS-defined settings
<li>to open a dialog to let the user modify the helper app settings
for a given mime type.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The helper app pref panel implementation is driven by an RDF data source.
Currently, that data source is a simple nsRDFXMLDataSource wrapper around
the mimeTypes.rdf file.
</p>
<p>If we replace that data source with an nsIRDFCompositeDataSource then
the prefs panel should, theoretically, be able to still work with no change
(since that interface is-a nsIRDFDataSource).</p>
<p>That composite data source will be composed of:
    <ul>
        <li>The existing mimeTypes.rdf data source
        <li>A new component implementing the nsIRDFDataSource interface
            by encapsulating the information in the native OS helper app
            settings.
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Given that, all the requirements would appear to be met relatively easily.
All the requests that currently go to the sinle mimeTypes.rdf data source
are automagically extended to fall back to the secondary native helper app
data source.</p>
<p>To better hide the defails of this implementation, most access to the
mime types and associated helper app information will be via a higher-level
interface that deals with nsIMIMEInfo objects.  That interface will translate
requests to the necessary RDF.  That will, hopefully, move all the RDF-specific
code that currently is spread between the 3 clients.</p>
<p>That higher-level interface is essentially
<a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/netwerk/mime/public/nsIMIMEService.idl">
nsIMIMEService</a>, with the addition
of a new method to add new entries and update entries:
<code>
<pre>
    /* Adds or updates the MIME info associated with a given 
     * mime type.
     *
     * @param  A MIME info object that provides the new or
     *         updated information.
     */
     void UpdateMIMEInfo( in nsIMIMEInfo aMIMEInfo );
</pre>     
</code>
</p>
<p>This method would be implemented in such a way that only new/modified
information would be added to the mimeTypes.rdf data source.</p>
<p>
For example,  
let's say the user went to the new helper app pref panel and editted the
entry for audio/x-pn-realaudio to uncheck the "always ask me before opening"
checkbox.  We would <b>not</b> want to store the application in mimeTypes.rdf,
because that would result in the wrong application being used if the user
upgraded to a new version of RealPlayer (or switched to using Windows Media Player).
RDF makes this relatively painless to do.
</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Implement new RDF data source that reflects OS settings for helper 
                   applications.  Requires mostly platform-specific code.
 The plan is                     to provide this capability on Win32 and
Mac platforms only.                     <b>15 days</b>
    <p>Broken down into subtasks:                         </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Define new RDF datasource interface and implement             
                   shared (platform-independent) portion, along with    
                            requisite build-system magic to build alternate 
                                implementations for each platform.      
                          <b>5 days</b></li>
      <li>Do Win32 implementation of this interface.                    
            <b>5 days</b></li>
      <li>Do Mac implementation of this interface.                      
          <b>5 days</b></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Implement new RDF data source that will "merge" the OS-settings   
                 datasource with the existing mimeTypes.rdf data source.
 More                     precisely, modify code that uses the existing "simple"
RDF                     datasource so that it uses a "composite" datasource
consisting                     of the new datasource described above, and,
the existing mimeTypes.rdf                     based datasource.        
            <b>9 days</b>
    <p>Broken down into subtasks:                         </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Modify .xul and .js code for pref panel to use the composite  
                              datasource.                               
 <b>3 days</b></li>
      <li>Modify C++ code in uriloader and uriloader\exthandler to      
                          use composite data source.                    
            <b>3 days</b></li>
      <li>Modify .js code in nsHelperAppDialog to use new composite     
                           datasource                                 <b>
3 days</b></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>What about plug-ins?  Communicator included plug-ins in the helper
app                     list and by rights Mozilla should do likewise (there
are bugs on that,                     I believe).  There is a separate  
                   <a href="http://law.mcom.com/TBD">line item</a>
 for Navigator to show plugins in the                     helper app pref
panel.  That support should be implemented as an                     RDF
datasource and then "composited" with the two described here.           
         
    <p>The additional work here to deal with that additional datasource: 
                       </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Add the plugins datasource to the composite datasource.       
                         <b>1 day</b></li>
      <li>UI changes to handle plugins (e.g., the user cannot           
                     change the mimetypes for plugins, or indicate that 
                               they should be "asked").                 
               <b>2 days</b></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The Mac implementation of the "OS helper app" data source will    
                very likely require some expertise on that platform.  There
is                     already a wrapper of sorts for the Mac Internet Config
settings                     and if the data source can be implemented on
top of that, then                     the specific Mac expertise required
will be much reduced.                 </li>
  <li>Are there usability issues related to showing the user too many   
                 file types?  On Windows, under Communicator, I see 200+
file types                     listed.                 </li>
  <li>What do we use for the "OS settings" on Linux?  This plan does not 
                   include showing such helper applications on platforms
other than                     Win32 and Mac.             </li>
</ul>
