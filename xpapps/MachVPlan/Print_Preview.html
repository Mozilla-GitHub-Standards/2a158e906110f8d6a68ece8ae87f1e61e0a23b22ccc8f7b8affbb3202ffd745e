<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
<p>Adding the "Print Preview" menu choice, by itself, is trivial.  The menu
choice                will be enabled/disabled in parallel with the existing
Print... menu choice.  It                is unclear whether this menu choice
will be available only in Navigator or also                in Mail/News,
though.  The assumption here is that we're adding it to Navigator only. 
           </p>
<p>That menu choice, when enabled, will either open a new "Print Preview"
window, or,                change the current window to "print preview mode."
 The former appears at this time 			   to be vastly simpler to implement
and is the course we plan to take.             </p>
<p>The new (or existing window), is put in "print preview mode"  			   by
QI'ing the nsIWebBrowser (or some other object?) for the nsIWebBrowserPrint 
               interface and calling that interface's ShowPrintPreview method.
 That method                returns an nsIPrintPreviewNavigation interface,
which then provides the methods                that advance through pages,
etc.             </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's all in theory.  nsIWebBrowserPrint doess not currently 
               declare the method ShowPrintPreview.  It appears that this
was supposed to be                fixed per                <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72691">
bug 72691</a>
                but that bug was closed (perhaps erroneously).  So the method
needs to be                added, and more importantly, implemented.  That
would seem to be a "BE" (back end)                task.             </p>
<p>Once the proper interfaces are in place and implemented, then it should
be                relatively straightforward to implement the new window.
 We will implement that 			   window using any simplifying assumptions that
can materially reduce the work 			   involved, while not materially reducing
the value to the user.  For example, it may  			   turn out to be necessary
to make the Print Preview window "modal" to the browser 			   window from
which it is opened.  E.g, if it turns out that subsequent navigation  			
  on that parent window raises significant stability issues.         </p>

<b>Update 2001 Oct 19</b>
</p>
<p>
Based on discussions with and input from Rod Spears, it now is looking like
"print preview" support in layout will be via a "galley mode" in which the
content will be drawn "wysiwyg" with respect to the printer output.  Basically,
it will look sort of like Adobe Acrobat where the output appears in the window
in page-sized chunks with appropriate white background, etc.  Opera does print
preview this way.
</p>
<p>
Given this, it seems that we won't need a separate window to display print
preview.  We will simply change Navigator so that the content area appears in
this "galley mode" format.  Rather than implementing a new window, the work will
entail modifying Navigator so that it works properly in this mode.  Those
details will not all be known till the back-end layout support is in place.
The kind of things we'll have to do include modifying the context menu,
preventing user actions that don't make sense (e.g., form submission), and so on.
</p>
<p>
This flavor of print preview will require less effort: only 9 days instead of 15.
The modified task estimates appear below.
</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add "Print Preview..." menu item.  <b>1 day</b></li>
  <li>Implement new "Print Preview" UI (.xul/.css/.dtd) and supporting 				
   code (.js).  This will be mostly modifications to existing components of
   the "Navigator window" (e.g., navigator.xul, navigator.js, etc.).
   <b>8 days</b>
    <p>This large task is broken down into the following subtasks: 						</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Prototype Print Preview to resolve high-order issues re:      
                          modality, BE interactions, platform-specific issues,
etc.                                 
This will basically be code that turns on and off the new "galley mode."
        <b>2 days</b></li>
      <li>Implement Print Preview specific UI and underlying function (e.g.,
          fast path to "Print").
                     <b>1 day</b></li>
      <li>Disable Navigator UI/function that doesn't work in Print Preview mode.
        <b>5 days</b></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This assumes that the "galley mode" approach is an acceptable approach.
  <li>Navigator-only?  Mail/News (probably not)?  Composer (probably)?  
                  Other windows (probably not)?  This plan is for Navigator
only.                 </li>
  <li>Need to synchronize with back-end effort/schedule.  This line item 				
   cannot be implemented by the "front end" on the current code base.   
         </li>
</ul>
