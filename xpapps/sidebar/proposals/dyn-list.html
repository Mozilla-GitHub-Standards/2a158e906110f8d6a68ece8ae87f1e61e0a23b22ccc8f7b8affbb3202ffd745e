<h3>I. <a name="Motivation"></a>
                                    Motivation</h3>
                                   The sidebar can be used to host web content
   as  well   as  applications via local XUL content.    Thus,  the two primary 
   parties       requiring enhancements to the sidebar    include  web developers 
      and    application developers (e.g. mozilla).      The sidebar panels' 
   datasource     is  used to store per-profile lists   of   user-selected 
 panels  and their state     (selected, removed entirely   from   "tabs" menu
 etc.).   Currently, there  are   four enhancement requests   having   an
impact on  or being impacted by the  sidebar  panels' datasource   structure. 
   These  enhancements warrant a change in the  datasource structure:   a 
move   from  a single, per-profile panels datasource   to a categorized, 
 composite   datasource that is composed of a profile-specific    datasource 
  and a global   (or set of global) datasource(s).   Here we will   present 
  how to achieve   the four following goals and we will  include design  
 recommendations:<br>
 
<ol type="i">
   <li>Modular panels' datasources (customer: installer for correctness  
  of     certain configurations)</li>
   <li>Dynamically switchable, locale-based collection of sidebar   panels 
         (customer:     l10n for useful user experience with a relevant set 
   of   panels   based on  locale)</li>
   <li>Expiration and intra-release installation of sidebar panels   (customer: 
              web developers/website who wish to push panels for new  paying 
   partners        and   remove panels of expired deals)</li>
   <li>Install of panels through XPInstall (customer: developers   who wish 
         to push chrome tabs via the web)<br>
   </li>
 
</ol>

<h3>II. <a name="Background"></a>
                                    Background</h3>
                                 First, let's outline the current design
for   panel    data   retrieval      and   state   maintenance.<br>
 
<h3>II.i. <a name="Data"></a>
                                 Data</h3>
                                 Given the present architecture, at profile-creation
      time   a  default     copy   of  the local panels datasource, panels.rdf,
      is copied    into the  profile   directory   and used as a base state. 
    As users   add panels   from the web  or through   the  customize  dialog 
   (reachable   through a menu   item in the  Tabs flyout)   additional  panels
    are added   to the <tt> current-panel-list     </tt>RDF sequence.   
The     structure  of the current single, per-profile    panels' datasource 
is&nbsp;   diagrammatically represented below.<br>
 <img src="../images/profile-panels-rdf.png" alt="[Image: Profile Current Panel List]" width="508" height="376" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5">
 <br>
 <br>
                                   When the user opens the customize dialog 
 they   are   presented      with   two   trees.   The left-hand side contains
  a  list built  from the    server-hosted     <tt>   master-panel-list </tt>
    in  the all-panels.rdf  datasource    file.  This     datasource lists
 <tt>  panel-groups</tt>       that  contain links    to other <tt>     
  panel-lists   </tt>or like   the <tt> master-panel-list    </tt> they can
 contain    links  to other  <tt>   panel-groups.</tt>    The structure 
   of the <tt> master-panel-list     </tt>   is diagrammatically  represented
   below.<br>

 <br>
 
<h3>II.ii. <a name="State"></a>
                                 State</h3>
                                  The order of the panels is maintained implicitly
     by  rearranging       the   tree   items which translates to rearranging
    the <tt> current-panel-list       </tt>   RDF   sequence persisted in
the    profile's  <tt>panels.rdf </tt>      datasource.       The  <tt> last-selected-panel 
      </tt>is remembered in  the  localstore.rdf    datasource   on a per-profile 
      basis.<br>

<h3>III. <a name="Solutions_by_contingent"></a>
                                    Proposed solutions by contingent</h3>
 
<h3>III.i.         <a name="For_modular_installs"></a>
                            For modular installs</h3>
 
<h4>Modular panels' datasources (per-component basis)</h4>
                                 Currently, panels are installed at component-installation
         time   (e.g.,    NIM  panel installed from NIM.xpi).  Yet, the default
      panels.rdf     datasource    that  keeps track of  user's panel selection
      list is global.      This means   for the  above cited example, NIM,
 even     if a user has only    installed Navigator    the  sidebar panels
 list will    expect a NIM panel.    Obviously there is a  run-time   failure
 (currently     ungraceful) since the    NIM panel was not installed.   <br>
 <br>
                                 To address this problem two approaches have
  been   suggested:<br>
 <br>
                                 (1) Ship <tt>&lt;component&gt;-panels.rdf</tt>
       datasources       for   each   component   being installed.  Subsequently 
   all these datasources       will  be  consulted when  building the user's 
   panel list.  Either the   <tt>        &lt;component&gt;-panels.rdf    
  </tt>  action to datasources   can be  copied  into the profile directory 
   at   profile-creation  time or  they  can  be consulted  as read-only every
  time   the  browser starts.   The problem   with this approach  is the
increase    in  startup  time when  performing the   "groveling through 
all <tt>*-panels.rdf</tt>            datasources"   to build   the user's 
panel list.   In addition,  the  ability  to implicitly  remember    panel 
order as could be  done when  we  had one unified    panels  list would  
be  lost.<br>
 <br>
       (2) The other approach would be to still ship a global    panels.rdf 
      per-profile    datasource but test for the existence of  local  panels
   and    either eliminate    them from the list (or more conservatively
    don't show   a sidebar header for   them in the current browser session)
    if they are missing.    An addition to  this approach would be to categorize 
       panels (via meta-info   tags for each   panel listing) as "ignore but
   don't    remove" vs. "remove if  absent". Add an arc named <tt>absent </tt>
      whose terminal node contains the action to take -- <tt>ignore </tt>
or  <tt>   remove</tt> -- when the panel is local (<tt>chrome://</tt>  or
<tt>   file:///</tt>    schemes) and the panel file is missing.<br>
 
<h3>III.ii. <a name="For_locale-switching"></a>
                            For locale-switching</h3>
 
<h4>Dynamically switchable, locale-based collection of sidebar panels</h4>
                                 The browser has the ability to switch locales. 
    However,     currently      locale-sensitive    sidebar panels do not 
switch   out or in dynamically.  There   are  two high-level      approaches 
to making     the content switch dynamically     to match the new   locale: 
  <br>
 <br>
       (1) have the panel send the locale as part of the  encoded     URL 
  so   new   content   can dynamically be served to the panel<br>
 <br>
       (2) have the sidebar "know" that the locale has been   switched  
  and     swap   out  all old locale-sensitive panels with the new   locale's
  panels.<br>
 <br>
                                 The first approach is purely server side 
but   would    require     redesigning       the  content of all current panels
  including    3rd-party    panels.  The second      approach would require
  the client  to:<br>
 <br>
       (1) tag each panel listing with meta-information  about    the   category 
       it  is  in: locale-sensitive vs. global content (we would add an arc 
  to the panel node named <tt>region </tt>which could be set to the region 
 short name or the <tt>global </tt>constant)<br>
 <br>
       (2) remember the order of global and locale-sensitive    panels  
 implicitly  so that   when locale switches       occur panel sequence order 
is maintained  -- hidden panels are simply not displayed<br>
 <br>
       (3) keep panels that have been explicitly reordered   by  users  
 intact       even   upon a locale switch (functionality that would   not
be possible      with    the first  approach).<br>
 
<h3>III.iii. <a name="For_expiration"></a>
                            For expiration</h3>
 
<h4>Intra-release cycle expiration of sidebar panels</h4>
                                 Panel developers would like to expire a
panel    either    by  setting     a  time   horizon  on the panel's life
or by explicitly    notifying   user  agents    that  the panel  has expired
(say upon a routine    content  refresh since a large percentage of clients
of this functionality  would be panels with dynamic content).<br>
 <br>
                                 (1) Setting a time horizon: once again we
 could    tag   each   panel-listing        with  an optional time-horizon
 arc that    is used   either   at every browser      startup   or shutdown
 to ask users    if they   wish to  remove panels that  have    expired.
   The time horizon    may be  a relative  or absolute value,  i.e.,  relative
  check:<tt>     panel-add-date    + horizon  &gt; now-date then  expire</tt>
       -or-    absolute  check:    <tt> horizon &gt;  now-date then expire.</tt><br>
 <br>
       (2) Explicit notification of panel removal: the ability     to  add
   panels     already  exists.  Expiration of panels must involve   explicit
    user   approval    before panels are removed.  In addition, web   content
  providers     may want  to  notify users by calling into the sidebar  
API.    This would   require  the  addition  of a<tt> nsISidebar.removePanel(title,
      expiration)</tt>        API  that  makes for a complete pairing alongside
   the   current <tt>   nsISidebar.addPanel()</tt>             API. &nbsp;Code
  embedded   in a sidebar panel would allow the panel to expire itself  
immediately      using a new enum   such  as<tt> nsISidebar.EXPIRE_NOW</tt>
 for   the <tt>   expiration    </tt>    parameter.<br>
 
<h3>III.iv. <a name="For_chrome_panel_installs"></a>
                            For chrome panel installs</h3>
 
<h4>Installation of chrome panels through XPInstall</h4>
                             Panel developers would like to add chrome panels,
   i.e.   local    panels    that contain XUL/JS content, either when the
mozilla   product  ships   or after    it has been installed. &nbsp;Currently,
only   panels that  are  remote (web   content) can be added to an installation 
  of mozilla because    local chrome  panels can pose a security risk (since 
  local content is given    access to browser  code that could manipulate 
local  resources including  local storage   devices and network connections, 
e.g., XPCOM's <tt>nsIFile </tt>   implementation).   &nbsp;The <tt>   window.sidebar</tt>
        object exports an API, <tt>addPanel()</tt>      , that allows web 
pages   to add panels with  user approval. &nbsp;Thus, currently   it is not
possible   to add a local chrome panel  through the sidebar API (known hacks
 to install  and add chrome panels require  users to take multiple steps
and  are deemed  unacceptable for commercial panel providers). &nbsp;<br>
 <br>
                        In order to install panels locally after a user has 
 installed      mozilla,     panel  providers should have to go through XPInstall. 
 &nbsp;Going      through     XPInstall  will communicate to the user that 
 software that   can   possibly   pose  a risk if malicious is being downloaded 
 and installed   as  opposed to  the more or less benign  alert that pops 
up when users add  panels  using the  current <tt>  addPanel()  </tt>API mentioned
above.<br>
 <br>
                        If a user is upgrading, their profile directory already 
   contains     their    panel-list.  &nbsp;If the upgrade contains new panels 
   that need    to be added    to the panel-list  this cannot currently be 
 done.  &nbsp;A   couple of possible    solutions exist  for this case:<br>
 <br>
                        (1) When the upgrade occurs the XPInstall engine
can   expose    a  new   API   that  explicitly "registers" the new panel
into  the current    profile's   panel-list.    &nbsp;This will not work
since multiple profiles    may exist   on a single machine   and only the
upgrader's profile will be   updated with   the new panel entry  in the panel-list.
&nbsp;This brings   us to the next  couple of proposals.<br>
 <br>
       (2) We could add a &lt;component&gt;-panels.rdf in a central   location, 
        e.g.,  bin/defaults/profile, and a composite datasource of   all the
   *-panels.rdf      files can be built. &nbsp;The final panel-list  can
be   a composite datasource      of the central "vendor" panels lists' composite
   datasource and the user's      profile panels.rdf. &nbsp;However, the
building    of this composite datasource      means a lot of file I/O at
every browser    session startup. &nbsp;This brings     us to the third and
more refined  solution.<br>
 <br>
       (3) We could maintain a new version arc  that     stores   the user-agent
 string of the client being used with the current     profile.     &nbsp;This
 string is checked at sidebar-initialization time.   &nbsp;In     the   event
 the string doesn't match that means either a user has  upgraded,     downgraded,
   or is using a different flavor of mozilla (e.g.,  mozilla   users   now
using   their profile with a Netscape 6.1 installation).   &nbsp;In   such
  a case  we grovel the "central" location for *-panel.rdf datasources  
  and then  construct the composite datasource that is reconciled with with
    the user's  panel-list. &nbsp;Therefore, reconciliation only takes places
    when the user  agent changes. &nbsp;In cases where panels have been installed
    using the XPInstall engine after the product has been installed and run,
   e.g., region packs that contain region-sensitive panels, an XPInstall
API    can be exposed that tells the sidebar to conduct reconciliation on
next   startup, i.e., delayed reconciliation, or  immediately.<br>

<h3>IV. <a name="Proposed_unified_solution"></a>
                                    Proposed unified solution</h3>
                        Having discussed the individual problems and some 
recommended       solutions      for each, let's build one solution that addresses
all  issues     in a coherent      manner. &nbsp;This will require the extension
 of the   <tt>   current-panel-list</tt>           format to include more
state information.     &nbsp;In turn, the sidebar    API   will need to be
extended for panel  developers   as well as for intra-application      clients
such as the XPInstall  engine   and locale-switching code. &nbsp;The    
 solution shall be described  in  the form of a couple of use cases. <br>
 <br>
                  To provide a quick picture of the proposed changes here 
  is  a  diagram     including the new arcs in the <tt>current-panel-list</tt>
           (which     might prove to be a handy reference in the solution 
that   will   follow).<br>

 <br>
 
<h3>IV.i. <a name="Installupgrade_use_case"></a>
                 Install/upgrade use case</h3>
                  The first use case will span the temporal   context of
an  initial     install    and a subsequent upgrade keeping in mind multi-profile 
   installations.<br>
 <br>
 <img src="../images/use-case.png" alt="[Image: Use case of changes to panels.rdf]" width="668" height="152">
 <br>
 
<h3>IV.i.a. Initial install</h3>
                  (1) New profile created.<br>
 <br>
       (2) The default panel-list is copied over from bin/default/profile/panels.rdf
         to the profile directory. &nbsp;This panel-list must contain entries
for     all panels included with the application including chrome panels
like search,    history,     bookmarks, and also the list of panels from
all region packs    shipping with    the product (even though some region
packs may not eventually be installed in a custom install:   extra entries
  shall remain dormant and innocuous as we will see).<br>
 <br>
       (3) The users <tt>current-panel-list</tt> shall contain a <tt>last-reconciled
          </tt>arc that will be the timestamp of the default panels.rdf file.
&nbsp;This          will be useful when new region packs and software packages
are installed.<br>
 
<h3>IV.i.b. Install of a new region pack with panels</h3>
                  (1) Now a region pack is installed.<br>
 <br>
       (2) The region pack shall register it's panels into the application's
      central  bin/default/profile/panels.rdf through an API we shall expose
    via   XPInstall,  say <tt>registerPanel()</tt>. &nbsp;We shall provide
 the   ability   to defer  registration to next browser startup or to perform
 registration      immediately.  &nbsp;Immediate registration entails updating
 the current    user's  panels.rdf  with the new panel entries. &nbsp;Deferred
 registration    is addressed  in the  next point: it becomes clear that
deferred  registration    is the natural  default  behavior.<br>
 <br>
       (3) On every browser session startup for every profile, the node 
value       of  the <tt>last-reconciled </tt>arc in the profile's panels.rdf
is compared       against  the application's central panels.rdf file timestamp.
&nbsp;If the profile's   is   older it is reconciled with the application's
central panels.rdf. &nbsp;Reconciliation      entails  composing a single
datasource from the profile's and the central      one (duplicate  resolution
is part of the RDF framework). &nbsp;This will     take care of the  problem
wherein one profile installs a region pack and    then others don't see it.
&nbsp;Since all profiles have their own notion   of&nbsp; they can each carry
out reconciliation  to remain    in sync with the central  list.<br>
 
<h3>IV.i.c. Install of a new software component with a panel</h3>
                  (1) Now install a software component.<br>
 <br>
       (2) The software component must also register panels it installs 
   through   XPInstall. &nbsp;The behavior for this state is the same as the
    case of installing  a new region pack.<br>
 
<h3>IV.i.d. Upgrade to a new version of the browser</h3>
                  (1) Now the user updates to a new version altogether.<br>
 <br>
       (2) The panels.rdf file timestamp will have changed.<br>
 <br>
       (3) Next time a profile starts up it will perform it's one time reconciliation 
        and get new panels. &nbsp;Any chrome panels that are now obsolete 
are    left    as entries in the central panels.rdf but have their <tt>absent 
 </tt>      arc  nodes  set to <tt>remove.</tt> &nbsp;Or if they are removed 
 altogether   and  their  <tt>absent </tt>arc nodes were set to <tt> ignore 
 </tt>the panels   will  simply  not be shown if detected to be missing from 
 the local volume.   &nbsp;(This    incidentally also solves the problem where
 shared mozilla  and netscape6  profiles  get a broken panel when using mozilla
 because of  the missing NIM  panel.)<br>
 
<h3>IV.ii. <a name="Locale-switching_use_case"></a>
                 Locale-switching use case</h3>
                  This use case entails users switching from one locale to
 another     and   then   back to the original. &nbsp;One can extrapolate
the expected     behavior   of ,multiple distinct llocale switches(potentially
without returning to the    original) from  this base use case.<br>
 
<h3>IV.ii.a. Switch from US region to CA region</h3>
                  (1) The user switches from US to CA region.<br>
 <br>
       (2) All the panels with <tt>region </tt>arc nodes that are set to
 <tt>        global</tt>    or the region short name, say <tt>CA, </tt>are 
shown.    &nbsp;There   is one  exception: if users have shown "regular/extensive"
    usage of a panel   then it is promoted from the old <tt>US </tt>region
 to   <tt>global. </tt>This way it will never be hidden on a locale switch
    and the order will   remain.  &nbsp;What is meant by "regular/extensive"
   is yet to be agreed upon:  it could  mean the user has moved this panel
 from   its original spot in the  current-panel-list.  &nbsp;Or it could
mean  the   user has opened the panel  a certain minimum threshold  number
of times.    &nbsp;Or  it could be a combination  of the two conditions 
mentioned.<br>
 
<h3>IV.ii.b. Switch back from CA region to US region</h3>
                  (1) The user switches back to US from CA.<br>
 <br>
       (2) All the CA panels are hidden and the US ones are shown again 
based       on  a match with the new target region short name (same behavior
 as  for   the  initial  case from US to CA).<br>

<h3>V. <a name="Backward_compatibility"></a>
                                    Backwards compatibility</h3>
                 If pre-existing profiles contain panels.rdf datasources
but   no <tt>last-reconciled </tt>arc we know this is an older format. &nbsp;We 
  can   reconcile the profile's    older format panels.rdf with the central 
 application   datasource since we  are  not eliminating arcs, only adding 
 new ones which   will receive reasonable   defaults if missing as and when
they are  consulted. &nbsp;Users   who then switch back   to an older installation 
 of mozilla will not be broken   since the additional   arcs from the proposed
format change will be ignored.   &nbsp;<br>

<h3>VI. <a name="Conclusion"></a>
                                    Conclusion</h3>
                 The proposed unified solution should address all four contingents 
    identified     at the outset of this document: locale-switching, missing 
   local panels,   installation  of new panels after an initial install, and
   expiration of panels  controlled  by the panel provider. &nbsp;The only
 outstanding  issue remaining  is whether  we want to allow panel providers 
 to be able to set expiration  of panels. &nbsp;We will take that up separately 
 in the future. &nbsp;For  now, we will work on implementing said design in
 the Mach V time frame after addressing any deficiencies identified during
the review of this proposal.<br>
