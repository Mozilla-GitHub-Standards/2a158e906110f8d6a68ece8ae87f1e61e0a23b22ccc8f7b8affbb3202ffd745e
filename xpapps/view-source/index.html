Implementing "View Source"
<BR>an XPApp Case Study
</FONT></B>
<BR>by <A HREF="mailto:law@netscape.com">Bill Law</A>

<P>I decided to tackle implementing of "View Source" as a means of
learning a bit about the nature of writing cross-platform application code
and to familiarize myself with the current xpfe state-of-the-art.
This document relates the hurdles I ran into and the lessons learned.


<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">
Basic strategy
</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE="-3"><IMG SRC="space.gif" HEIGHT=3 WIDTH=1><BR></FONT>

Fortunately, "View Source" had been recently (like, the very same day!)
implemented in the "viewer" test application. I looked into how that
was done. While done much differently than I might have envisioned
(I have written <A HREF="strategy.html">more on that strategy</A>), it worked as well as I
needed it to and it was readily accessible to clients of the web shell.
Basically, the member function nsIWebShell::LoadURL takes an additional
"command" argument that allows you to specify "view-source." The
web shell then shows the HTML source, suitably decorated, rather than rendering
the HTML proper.
<P>So I set out to add a "View Source" menu choice and to wire it up to
this nsIWebShell function.


<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">
Adding the new menu choice
</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE="-3"><IMG SRC="space.gif" HEIGHT=3 WIDTH=1><BR></FONT>

To add the "View Source" menu choice to the "File" submenu, I had to make
the following changes/additions:
<UL>
<LI>
Add a constant <TT>VIEWER_FILE_VIEW_SOURCE</TT> to the file mozilla/xpfe\xpviewer\src\resources.h.

<LI>
Add the line <TT>CreateMenuItem(fileMenu, "View Source", VIEWER_FILE_VIEW_SOURCE);
</TT>to the function CreateBrowserWindows (in nsBrowserWindow.cpp).

<LI>
Add another case to the switch statement in <TT>nsBrowserWindow::DispatchMenuItem
</TT>which simply dispatches a new member function <TT>nsBrowserWindow::DoViewSource</TT>.

<LI>
Add DoViewSource member function to the declaration and implementation
of nsBrowserWindow (more on this in the next section).
</UL>
All in all, this is pretty isomorphic to what I'd have to do to implement
a similar feature to the old browser (on Windows, at least). The
first thing to note is that when I do it here, it's done for all platforms.

<P>Of course, in an ideal world one wouldn't write code for this, one would
simply add some tags to an XML file and write a little JavaScript.
Someday, hopefully, we'll get closer to making that a reality.

<P>But for now, let's look closer at the fact that I had to make 3 different
changes to the <B>window </B>in order to add a new menu choice that really
didn't have anything to do with the menu, per se. It would be nice
if the window were clever enough to simply have a collection of menu choices
that it dutifully attaches to itself and to which it dispatches appropriate
events. The window wouldn't have to know anything about those menu
choices. In other words, DispatchMenuItem wouldn't look for specific
menu IDs. It would simply wire up the menu so that the menu ID could
be used to do dynamic lookup in its collection of menu items. The
selection would then be relayed to the menu item, which would implement
the corresponding command.

<P>Note that when I speak of "menu items" above, I really mean "commands"
in a more general sense, since the menu is really just the presentation
of a command (i.e., it might be a button, instead).

Doing </FONT><FONT SIZE="+2"><TT>DoViewSource</TT>
</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE="-3"><IMG SRC="space.gif" HEIGHT=3 WIDTH=1><BR></FONT>

Next, I looked at implementing nsBrowserWindow::DoViewSource so that
it caused the document source to appear in a new window.

<P>My first thought was that this was not really the responsibility
of the window. I can think of lots of ways of implementing "view
source" and I wouldn't think I'd have to tweak the window to implement
an alternative at some future date.

<P>Plus, there are some possible pragmatic reasons why the window shouldn't
be given this responsibility. It might be that a window with the
source might already be open. The window ought not have to remember
that. And "view source" might be implemented as another "application"
in which case we'd like to pass the request out to the app shell to process
(so it could, for example, load the "view source application").

<P>So I implemented nsBrowserWindow::DoViewSource to that it punted
the request to the "browser application":
<BR>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" >
 <TR>
  <TD>
<PRE>
<TT>void</TT>
nsBrowserWindow::DoViewSource()
{
    // <I>Ask the app shell to open a "view source window"</I>
    // <I> for this window's URL.</I>
    PRInt32    theIndex;
    PRUnichar *theURL;
    if ( // <I>Get the history index for this page.</I>
         NS_OK == mWebShell->GetHistoryIndex(theIndex)
         &amp;&amp;
         // <I>Get the URL for that index.</I>
         NS_OK == mWebShell->GetURL(theIndex,&amp;theURL) ) {
        // <I>Tell the app to open the source for this URL.</I>
        mApp->ViewSourceFor(theURL);
        //<I>XXX Find out how theURL is allocated, and perhaps delete it...</I>
    } else {
        // <I>FE_Alert!</I>
    }
}</PRE>
  </TD>
 </TR>

<CAPTION ALIGN=BOTTOM>nsBrowserWindow::DoViewSource Implementation</CAPTION>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>The code itself (i.e., get the index, load the url, tell the app to
open a source window) comes from the equivalent code in the plain (non-xp)
viewer. This code is reasonably straightforward, aside from being
a nsBrowserWindow member function versus a nsViewerApp or nsAppshell member
function (as discussed in the preceding section). The error handling
could use some work, though.
<BR>


<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">
<TT>nsViewerApp::ViewSourceFor</TT>
</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE="-3"><IMG SRC="space.gif" HEIGHT=3 WIDTH=1><BR></FONT>

I next had to add this member function to the browser application class,
nsViewerApp. The implementation was essentially the same as from
the plain viewer:
<BR>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER WIDTH="100%">
 <TR>
  <TD>
<PRE>
// <I>I think this should be punted to the</I>
// <I> app shell to allow for "view source"</I>
// <I> to be better separated from plain </I>
// <I>browsing. But, this way is better given</I>
// <I> the current situation.</I>
NS_IMETHODIMP
nsViewerApp::ViewSourceFor(const PRUnichar *pURL)
{
  // <I>Create browser window</I>
  nsBrowserWindow* bw = nsnull;
  nsresult rv = 
     nsRepository::CreateInstance(kBrowserWindowCID, 
            nsnull, kIBrowserWindowIID, (void**) &amp;bw);
  // <I>Hey, this isn't kosher, is it?  What if this</I>
  // <I> isn't a nsBrowserWindow?</I>
  bw->SetApp(this);

  PRUint32 chromeMask =
    (PRUint32)~( NS_CHROME_TOOL_BAR_ON // <I>No toolbar.</I>
               | NS_CHROME_LOCATION_BAR_ON // <I>No location bar.</I>
               | NS_CHROME_PERSONAL_TOOLBAR_ON ); // <I>No personal toolbar.</I>
   bw->Init(mAppShell, mPrefs, nsRect(0, 0, 620, 400), 
            chromeMask, PR_FALSE);

  // <I>Tell the new window's web shell to view the source.</I>
  nsIWebShell *pWebShell = 0;
  if( NS_OK == bw->GetWebShell(pWebShell) ) {
    pWebShell->LoadURL(pURL,"view-source");
    bw->Show();
    NS_RELEASE(pWebShell);
  } else {
    // <I>FE_Alert!</I>
  }

  return NS_OK;
}
</PRE>
  </TD>
 </TR>

<CAPTION ALIGN=BOTTOM>nsViewerApp::ViewSourceFor Implementation</CAPTION>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>This code works, more or less. But I wasn't at all happy with it.

<P>First, I really wanted to pass this request up another level to
the application shell (as the comment indicates) so that one could have
a pluggable "view html source" application distinct from the "browser"
application. But, I did it here for expediency.

<P>It was expedient because I used an nsBrowserWindow to display the
HTML source and there was already code just like this in nsViewerApp to
open browser windows. But I think it would have been better to create
a new app/window class combination to do "view source." That would
permit the chrome hacking to go there, rather than here (it is a little
unseemly for the browser window to know have to know how to fiddle chrome
settings for a non-browser window).

<P>There's some other hackery here. The CreateInstance call asks
for an nsIBrowserWindow interface but presumes that an nsBrowserWindow
is created, which seems optimistic. I "inherited" this code from
nsViewerApp::OpenWindow.

<P>Additional stuff should be done here, like disable "View source"
in this new window and give it an appropriate title. But again, that
seems contrary to the job of a browser application/window and I'd rather
create the view-source application/window classes to handle that stuff.
<BR>


<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">
<TT>Fixing nsBrowserWindow</TT>
</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE="-3"><IMG SRC="space.gif" HEIGHT=3 WIDTH=1><BR></FONT>

That's all it took, except for the fixing of an over-abundance of breakages
that ensued with the imiplementation of nsBrowserWindow.

<P>The problem was that I turned off the the toolbars. This resulted
in some data members of nsBrowserWindow being null. This caused problems
when the browser window tried to do things like reposition the toolbars
during layout, disable/enable the stop button, etc.

<P>There were about a half-dozen places that broke. I think the
general problem is essentially the same as seen when one adds a simple
menu item: the browser window has to know far too much about the browser
window widgetry for its own good.

<P>Instead of manually laying out the toolbars, it should do something
more like what MFC does for this: simply maintain a collection of toolbars
and at layout time, simply iterate over the list, sizing and position each
based on attributes of the toolbar (whether its on top or bottom, fixed
or variable sized, etc.). That way, if the personal toolbar is in
the collection, it gets layed out, if it's not, it doesn't. You don't
have to add if statements all over looking for null pointers.

<P>The button enabling problem is similar. The window should
surface a number of observable events and the buttons that care about document
load starting, ending, etc. would look for those and enable/disable themselves.


<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial,Helvetica">
Conclusions
</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE="-3"><IMG SRC="space.gif" HEIGHT=3 WIDTH=1><BR></FONT>

After this simple 2-day exercise, it is my conclusion is that the current
xpviewer source base isn't up to the task of serving as more than an architectural/design
guide for the real XPApp shell and browser application. It requires
too much fundamental re-architecture to permit saving enough code to be
worth the effort.

<P>It continues to serve as a test bed for testing out ideas and investigating
the use of some of the underlying core interfaces.
