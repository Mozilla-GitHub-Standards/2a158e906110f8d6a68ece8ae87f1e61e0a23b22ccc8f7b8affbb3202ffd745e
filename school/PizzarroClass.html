<font face="Times">SHIPPENSBURG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS PARTICIPATE IN NETSCAPE
PROJECT</font></h3></center>
A Shippensburg University computer science class is contributing to the
latest software from Netscape Communications Corp. through a unique classroom
project that gives them experience with cutting-edge technology.
<p>Richard H. Pizzarro, principal software development engineer at Netscape
and a 1988 Shippensburg University graduate, arranged the project.
<p>"It's unbelievable exposure for students to get involved in a project
like this," said Pizzarro. "Without being thrust into it, they can see
what a large-scale engineering project is like."
<p>Nine students in Dr. Carol Wellington's Software Engineering class are
adding features to the Netscape software that will widen its appeal in
the market. The software includes a browser that allows users to surf the
Internet.<img SRC="Rich201.jpg" BORDER=0 height=135 width=200 align=RIGHT>
<p>"The opportunity that my students have to work on Netscape cannot be
outdone by bigger schools," said Wellington, assistant professor of computer
science. "We don't know of any other place that, as part of its curriculum,
is doing Netscape development. That's an impressive thing to have on your
r&eacute;sum&eacute; when you go to look for a job."
<p>Five students are working on a feature to enable software users to view
cafeteria or restaurant menus. Another group is designing a user interface,
or skin, to allow blind people to use the software.
<p>"We're all really learning a lot," said Adam Gonsman, a 19-year-old
sophomore. "This whole project is on the cutting edge. We're going into
unfamiliar territory. We're really fortunate."
<p>The opportunity arose through emergence of the Open Source method of
software engineering. In March 1998, Netscape publicly released the source
code for its Communicator software through Mozilla.org, allowing independent
developers to contribute additions and modifications to the original source
code.
<p>"We have people all around the world who are contributing to the Mozilla
effort," said Pizzarro, who helps monitor the software contributions. "It
makes the product better. It lets us expand our reach, because it's not
just a Web browser, but you can build applications on it. It's a platform
on which to build applications. It's just so flexible. We've never had
this offering before. The software will eventually be used in a number
of products, not just computers. In five or 10 years, you're going to have
devices -- that haven't been invented yet -- in your house to help you
access information. Those devices are going to be based on this technology.
That's what's exciting."
<p>By allowing a diverse group of people to contribute to its development,
Netscape is ensuring that the software will have wide appeal. In turn,
the Shippensburg students and other contributors gain experience and help
create a new product.
<p>"The experience is going to be great," said Doug Albright, a 20-year-old
sophomore. "I'm going to be learning a lot about html, XUL and how the
browser works."
<p>He and others taking the Software Engineering I course are working on
the requirements analysis and design phase of their project. This fall,
in Software Engineering II, they will test and implement their designs.

<td WIDTH="45%">&nbsp;The project "is a good way to attract quality students
and quality faculty members," Wellington said. "The more real-world things
we give our students, the better prepared they are, and that makes our
program better."
<p>Pizzarro hopes to trigger similar projects at the other universities
of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education and enhance Pennsylvania's
reputation in the computer industry.
<p>"There's nothing that would make me happier than for the State System
to be considered a leader in this high-tech field," he said. "On a grand
scale, I'd like people to think of Pennsylvania as an emerging high-tech
area."&nbsp;</td>

<p>He believes that telecommuting technology will allow more Pennsylvanians
to work for computer companies in states like California and Washington.
Living in Mechanicsburg and working for Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape,
Pizzarro is a testament to the potential of telecommuting and the utility
of e-mail, instant messaging and other communication devices. "It can happen
anywhere, especially now, the way I'm working."
<p>He's confident about Pennsylvania's potential partly because his former
company, InSoft Inc., maker of desktop videoconferencing software, blossomed
in Mechanicsburg, far from the glitter of Silicon Valley.
<p>Pizzarro and his former partner, Daniel L. Harple Jr., started the company
in 1991, working out of their homes, and built it into a 70-employee firm
valued at about $145 million. Netscape acquired the company in 1996. "I
was fortunate and lucky, but I also worked my tail off," Pizzarro said,
recalling his 100- to 120-hour workweeks. "It's amazing how hard I worked."
<p>For all his success, this son of a Puerto Rican immigrant is determined
not to forget his roots. Remembering that a reference from an SU professor
led him to his first job, Pizzarro wants to help students make contacts
with potential employers through the Netscape project. "It's great exposure
for them to network and meet decision makers."
<p>As a product of a State System university, he also wants to give opportunities
to students who didn't have the means to attend a larger school. "I want
to make sure that students at the state schools don't get overlooked just
because mom and dad didn't have enough money. There's too much made of
the old-world prestige. High-tech's not like that. If you can do the job,
I don't care where you went to school."
<p>With his help, the Shippensburg students are getting a chance to prove
their worth while gaining experience that will enhance their resumes.
<p>"It's kind of nice to have this opportunity to work on a real project,"
said Bruce Miller, a 21-year-old senior. "A larger project like this definitely
shows a lot more ability on the programmer's part."
<p>Pizzarro hopes the Mozilla project will also help him recruit employees
for Netscape. "The beauty of it is that you've got potential employees
out there who are training themselves. I'm going to meet some bright, go-getter
students whom we need to hire. You can never find enough talent."
<p>While visiting Wellington's class recently, he introduced himself to
the students and admired their work. "This is good," he said, viewing the
cafeteria-menu design on a laptop computer. "We could really use this at
Netscape. This is just great."
<p>The students appreciate his support. "I think it's really great," Gonsman
said of Pizzarro's contributions to the class. "It really stands as a testimony
of what kind of graduates this college produces and how loyal they are
to their alma mater that they're willing to come back and help the students."
