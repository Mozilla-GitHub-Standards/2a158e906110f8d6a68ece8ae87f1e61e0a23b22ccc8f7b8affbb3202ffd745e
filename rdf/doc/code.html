<P>
The good news is that a very large part of it is done and working.
The bad news is that a lot of it needs to be cleaned up and finished.

<P>
Here are some of the major chunks of work that need to be done:
<UL>
<LI> Finish garbage collection of RDF_Resources and of RDF_Assertions.
<LI> Need to separate out core RDF code (mostly mcf.c) from the code for
the rdf data sources (fs2rdf.c, hist2rdf.c, etc.)
<LI> Finish implementing RDF_ArcsIn and RDF_ArcsOut.
<LI> Reflection of the RDF APIs into JavaScript (<a href=mailto:jg@netscape.com>jg</a> is working on this)
<LI> Finish implementing <a href="pcs.html">PCS (Persistent Client Store).</a>
<LI> Finish implementing <a href="shack.html">Shack</a> 
(<a href="mailto:spence@netscape.com">Spence Murray</a>) is doing this.
<LI> Finish exposing LDAP as an RDF data source.
<LI> Make the RDF parser use the XML parser. See <a href="xml.html">XML</a>
<LI> Expose RDF APIs to plugins via XPCOM so that we can dynamically load new data sources.
<LI> Lots of general cleanup and bugfixing.
</UL>

<code>ns/modules/rdf/include</code> has the header files for the APIs exported
out of the RDF module. 
<P>
<code>rdf.h</code> is the header for the core RDF api.
<P>
<code>ht.h</code> is the header for the hyper-tree api built on top of the 
RDF apis. 
<P>
Send mail to 
<a href="mailto:rjc@netscape.com,guha@netscape.com,jg@netscape.com">us</a>
if you are interested in working with the RDF or Aurora code.
