<h3>Overview</h3>

This document is a high level overview of the 
RDF code in Mozilla. You need to 
understand the material in this document before
hacking the Mozilla RDF code. You'll also need to read the formal <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</A> specifications. We do not attempt a
formal overview of RDF here. Instead, consult the W3C Recommendation for
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/">RDF Model and Syntax</A>. See
also the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-rdf-schema/">RDF Schema</A>
Proposed Recommendation, which describes the RDF type system and model for
metadata vocabulary description.</P>  


<P>
If all you want to do is use the Mozilla RDF APIs for your
own application, you don't need to understand everything
given here, but it might be a good idea anyway.
<P>
If you are looking for material on how RDF is used
in applications, see the <A HREF="aurora.html">'Aurora'</A> document or
the  guide or the <A HREF="xul-template-reference.html">XUL Template
Reference</A>; these describe how RDF data sources manifest themselves in
the user interface.

<h3>The Basic Idea</h3>


We have a lot of different pieces of structured data --- bookmarks,
history, file systems, document structures, sitemaps, etc. The
creation/access/manipulation code for these are completely
independent. So, each of them has its own storage system, editing and
viewing tools, query and manipulation APIs, etc. 

There is a substantial lost opportunity here. There is considerable
overlap in the data model used by all these different structures. All
these structures are instances of directed labeled graphs. 

So, the basic idea behind RDF is : if you can manifest yourself via
the RDF data model (which is built upon directed labeled graphs),
there is a marketplace of services that you can utilize. Some of these
services include, 

<OL>
  <LI> Viewers and Editors for these structures. 
  <LI> Persistent Storage 
  <LI> Query Mechanisms 
  <LI> Inferential services such as type checking and inheritance. 
  <LI> Compositing, i.e., the ability to provide merged views of multiple
     graphs. Uses of this are described later. 
  <LI> Serialization and transmission via the RDF-XML format. 
  <LI>and many other services that we haven't yet thought about ... 
</OL>

Another way of looking at it is as follows: Just as COM/beans/...
allows pieces of code to work together because they manifest a common
object model, RDF tries to do the same thing for data and the common
data model is built upon that of directed labeled graphs. 


<h3>What is RDF</h3>


<h4>Informal Overview</h4>

<P>
RDF, in its most simple form, is a directed labeled graph.  Imagine
triples of the following: 
nodes (keyed off of URLs such as "http://people.netscape.com/rjc/") with
arc nodes (such as "Owner Name") pointing to other nodes (such as "Robert
John Churchill"). Each triple is an RDF "assertion" or "statement".
</P>

<P>Most people, including end users, are familiar with hierarchies... from
file systems to Netscape's bookmark window, a hierarchy helps to indicate
organization in a tree. Through the use of mechanisms (ie. XUL templates
and RDF's built-in notion of containership) that project an RDF graph onto a
tree structure, we can present hiearchically oriented interfaces to 
arbitrarily complex RDF graph strutures.
</P>


<P>Question: How does data make its way into RDF graphs?

<P>Answer:  For every type of data, there is an associated data source. 
For example, file and folders from the local file system are reflected
into RDF's graph via a file system data source that responds to queries
from RDF's engine.
</P>



<H2>Model vs Syntax</H2>

There are a couple very different things meant by 
the term RDF. 
<UL>
<LI> RDF as a data model / data abstraction layer / query language.
Directed Labeled Graphs (DLG) are a very general mechanism
for representing things. Naturally, it turns out that
you can model a wide range of information as a DLG.
It doesn't matter how the information is stored
on disk or transmitted over the wire --- if it can
be modeled as a DLG, we can make it queriable as a DLG.
<LI> RDF as a file format using XML. It would be nice
to have a canonical file format to ship snippets of
RDF across the wire. This is the RDF File format. Note that future <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">W3C</A> work may result in alternative
mechanisms for shipping RDF graphs around in XML. The RDF 1.0 syntax
is just one of many possible ways we might use XML to interchange RDF.
</UL>

Nodes in RDF DLGs are Resources in the sense of U<B>R</B>Is.
This means that you can get two different graphs from
different sources that reference some of the same nodes.
You can superpose the two graphs (making sure that the
common nodes are properly aligned) and you have just
aggregated the information from the two sources.
<P>
This aggregation ability is used all around the place 
with RDF for personalization, overriding, etc.


<h3>RDF Datasource</h3>

<P>
An RDF datasource represents a directed labeled graph. See the <A
HREF="datasource-howto.html">Datasource HOWTO</A> guide for more
details on the RDF datasource APIs.
</P>


<P>
 Every RDF graph consists of 
<OL>
   <LI> A set of nodes which are either 'resources' or 'literals'.
Resources in the Mozilla RDF API are defined in the interface <A
HREF="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/rdf/base/idl/nsIRDFResource.idl">nsIRDFResource</A>.
Literal nodes are defined in the interface <A
HREF="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/rdf/base/idl/nsIRDFLiteral.idl">nsRDFLiteral</A>

   <LI> A set of arcs, each labeled with a resource (actually in the RDF
specs a specific sub-type of 'resource' called 'property') and a <em>truth
value</em>, i.e., a true/false label. 
 </OL>   

An RDF datasource (<A
HREF="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/rdf/base/idl/nsIRDFDataSource.idl">nsRDFDataSource</A>)
can be aggregated with other RDF graph using <A
HREF="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/rdf/base/idl/nsIRDFCompositeDataSource.idl">nsIRDFCompositeDataSource</A>.
This interface presents as a single graph an aggregation of an ordered
list of RDF data sources, each contributing a portion of the graph. The
aggregation of the graphs is defined by simple superpositioning. The
ordering of data sources specifies a priority and if an arc appears in
multiple data sources with different truth values, the arc from the
higher data source overrides. Each data source itself is identified by a
URI. Note that the RDF Model and Syntax iteself only provides for
<EM>positive</EM> assertions; the ability to store negative assertions is a
behind-the-scenes mechanism and does not have any representation in the
XML syntax.
</P>

<P>Some standard data sources already in progress are </P>
<UL>
<LI> A file encoded in RDF, MCF, Netscape bookmarks or any of the data file
formats that Navigator understands.
<LI> FTP directories
<LI> Local file systems (A, C, D, etc. drives, Mac Volumes, etc.)
<LI> Berkeley DB encodings of RDF
<LI> Browser history
</UL>

<P>
More data sources can easily be added. We hope this will happen with
the help of the developers outside Netscape. 
</P>

<P>
The Mozilla RDF Query API is a very standard graph query API. It can be
used both to traverse and to edit the graph. It is easy to expose a new
source of data via the RDF APIs. To do this, one provides a wrapper
(around that data source) that implements the RDF APIs.
<P>
A data source could be a read-write store or a read-only store. It can
also be a read-partial-write store, i.e., it can execute only some of 
the edits presented to it. e.g., folder based file system directories
are far less expressive than general RDF graphs. In the more general
model, it is possible to make statements like "File001 contains the
response to email0017". Neither the file system (nor the email system)
is capable of representing such a statement. The wrapper for the
file system (and email system) can legally refuse to perform such
an edit. If a more general purpose RDF data source (for example one
based on Berkeley DB), that database  could perform the addition.
The user of the query API need not know the difference.
<P>
