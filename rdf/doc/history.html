<h3>Goals</h3>
<OL>
<LI> Better (i.e., faster, leaner, easier to use) organizations and
presentations of history.
<LI> More intuitive auto-complete, possibly using history for pre-caching.
</OL>

<h3>How it works today</h3>


mozilla.hst (or netscape.hst) is a DBM hashtable of the pages that have
been visited in the last N (where N is typically equal to 9) days. Each
entry has a title, date stamp, etc. The code that creates and maintains
this hashtable is in ns/lib/libmisc/glhist.c
<BR>
ns/modules/rdf/hist2rdf.c walks over this database and creates in-memory
RDF structures corresponding to the clustering presented in the history
section of NavCenter. Since the clustering is done when the browser comes up, 

<OL>
<LI> We can't afford to do very sophisticated clustering.
<LI> It wastes memory
</OL>

<h3>How it should work</h3>

<OL>
<LI> We have a simple history update API that netlib uses to update
the history database. The API is implemented on top of the RDF APIs.
<LI> The on-disk representation should include the clustering which should
be adaptive. The code for this can be taken from nlcstore.c. 
modules/rdf/src/hist2rdf and lib/libmisc/glhist.c should be replaced with this.
<LI> glhist currently stores a lot more than it needs to --- images,
interior frames, etc. We should avoid this. It would also be good
to store trail information.
<LI> glhist also currently supports auto-completion and this should be
supported by the new representation.
<LI> It should be possible for the history to be stored on a remote server
(using some other on-disk representation --- this will be handled by the
RDF abstraction layer).
<LI> We should look into using trail information for pre-caching.
</OL>
