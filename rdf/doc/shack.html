<h2>Shack : NavCenter as an HTML Widget</h2>

The NavCenter widget does not have dependencies on the window
into which it is drawing. The basic idea behind shack is that
we could use an object tag like,

<pre>
&lt;object data="...foo.rdf" height=... width=...&gt;
</pre>

and have a NavCenter tree widget appear in the html. It will
allow for sorting, multiple selection drag and drop, etc.
Changes made to the data in foo.rdf can be sent back to a server
(or the foo.rdf can be specified to be read-only, in which case,
changes will not be allowed).
<P>
This will provide a very scalable version of data binding.
The ability to tell the server what has changed is also very
important : it allows for the next generation of HTML-based applications.
