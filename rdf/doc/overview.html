<H1>Status:</H1>
<P>This document is <B>outdated</B>, and reflects the state of RDF in
Mozilla before we moved to use of the new layout engine. It remains mostly
accurate but specifics of technical details are a little dated.

<h3>This Document</h3>
The document is a high level overview about the 
RDF code in Navigator. You need to 
understand the material in this document before
hacking the Navigator RDF code in <code>ns/modules/rdf/</code>.
<P>
If all you want to do is use the RDF C Apis for your
own application, you don't need to understand everything
given here, but it might be a good idea anyway.
<P>


<h3>The Basic Idea</h3>


We have a lot of different pieces of structured data --- bookmarks,
history, file systems, document structures, sitemaps, etc. The
creation/access/manipulation code for these are completely
independent. So, each of them has its own storage system, editing and
viewing tools, query and manipulation APIs, etc. 

There is a substantial lost opportunity here. There is considerable
overlap in the data model used by all these different structures. All
these structures are instances of directed labeled graphs. 

So, the basic idea behind RDF is : if you can manifest yourself via
the RDF data model (which is built upon directed labeled graphs),
there is a marketplace of services that you can utilize. Some of these
services include, 

<OL>
  <LI> Viewers and Editors for these structures. 
  <LI> Persistent Storage 
  <LI> Query Mechanisms 
  <LI> Inferential services such as type checking and inheritance. 
  <LI> Compositing, i.e., the ability to provide merged views of multiple
     graphs. Uses of this are described later. 
  <LI> Serialization and transmission via the RDF-XML format. 
  <LI>and many other services that we haven't yet thought about ... 
</OL>

Another way of looking at it is as follows: Just as COM/beans/...
allows pieces of code to work together because they manifest a common
object model, RDF tries to do the same thing for data and the common
data model is built upon that of directed labeled graphs. 


<h3>What is RDF</h3>

There are a couple very different things meant by 
the term RDF. 
<UL>
<LI> RDF as a data model / data abstraction layer / query language.
Directed Labeled Graphs (DLG) are a very general mechanism
for representing things. Naturally, it turns out that
you can model a wide range of information as a DLG.
It doesn't matter how the information is stored
on disk or transmitted over the wire --- if it can
be modeled as a DLG, we can make it queriable as a DLG.
<LI> RDF as a file format using XML. It would be nice
to have a canonical file format to ship snippets of
RDF across the wire. This is the RDF File format.

</UL>

Nodes in RDF DLGs are Resources in the sense of U<B>R</B>Is.
This means that you can get two different graphs from
different sources that reference some of the same nodes.
You can superpose the two graphs (making sure that the
common nodes are properly aligned) and you have just
aggregated the information from the two sources.
<P>
This aggregation ability is used all around the place 
with RDF for personalization, overriding, etc.


<h3>RDF Database</h3>

An RDF database is a directed labeled graph. Almost all 
the RDF apis include reference to an RDF Database.

<P>
The graph consists of 
 <OL>
   <LI> A set of nodes called <em>RDF_Resource</em>. 
<P>   
        In addition to RDF_Resource, nodes can also be char* or int32.
        The type of a node (i.e., RDF_Resource, char* or int32) is specified
        as an argument in many of the APIs.
 
   <LI> A set of arcs, each labeled with a RDF_Resource and a <em>truth value</em>,
        i.e., a true/false label. 
 </OL>   

An RDF Database is actually an aggregation of an ordered list of RDF data sources,
each contributing a portion of the graph. The aggregation of the graphs is
defined by simple superpositioning. The ordering of data sources specifies
a priority and if  an arc appears in multiple data sources
with different truth values, the arc from the higher data source overrides.
Each data source itself is identified by a uri. The following calls
are used to create an RDF Database and eventually to dispose it.

The char** argument to RDF_GetDB specifies the uris for the RDF data sources.
Some standard data sources already built into navigator are <BR>
<UL>
<LI> A file encoded in RDF, MCF, Netscape bookmarks or any of the data file
formats that Navigator understands.
<LI> FTP directories
<LI> Local file systems (A, C, D, etc. drives, Mac Volumes, etc.)
<LI> Berkeley DB encodings of RDF
<LI> Netscape history format
</UL>

More data sources can easily be added. We hope this will happen with
the help of the developers outside Netscape.


<h3>RDF Queries</h3>
The RDF Query API is a very standard graph query API. It can be
used both to traverse and to edit the graph.
<P>
Every RDF Query API takes an RDF database as an argument. Each RDF
data source is required to implement a set of RDF Data Source APIs. A database
itself implements the RDF Query API by by issuing RDF Data Source
API queries to its data sources.
<P>
The RDF Data Source API is a strict subset of the RDF Query API.
This means that an RDF Database can also be an RDF Data source.


<P>
<h3>RDF Data Sources</h3>
It is easy to expose a new source of data via the RDF APIs. To do this,
one provides a wrapper (around that data source) that implements the
RDF APIs.
<P>
A data source could be a read-write store or a read-only store. It can
also be a read-partial-write store, i.e., it can execute only some of 
the edits presented to it. e.g., folder based file system directories
are far less expressive than general RDF graphs. In the more general
model, it is possible to make statements like "File001 contains the
response to email0017". Neither the file system (nor the email system)
is capable of representing such a statement. The wrapper for the
file system (and email system) can legally refuse to perform such
an edit. If a more general purpose RDF data source (such as the one
based on Berkeley DB), that database  could perform the addition.
The user of the query API need not know the difference.
