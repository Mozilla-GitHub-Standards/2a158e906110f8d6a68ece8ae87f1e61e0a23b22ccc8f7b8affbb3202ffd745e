<p>
Time flies when you're having fun.
</p>

<p>
It's already been a year since the Mozilla Foundation was created, and it's been
quite a year. The Mozilla Foundation has prospered, our products are receiving
rave reviews, consumer and enterprise interest in Mozilla products is at an all
time high, the awareness of the importance of choice in browser software
is growing and our community remains vigorous and energetic.
</p>

<p>
The Mozilla project has long been an open source technology leader. With our new
Firefox and Thunderbird products, we are now focusing on bringing a better
Internet experience to millions of new users.
</p>

<p>
There have been many highlights for the Mozilla Foundation this year:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We've built a potent development team to lead continued innovation.
    Our small team is built entirely of veterans with many years of experience
    in the Mozilla project.
  </li>
  <li>
    We turned our attention to the end user for the first time, after years of
    being solely a technology project. The result: Firefox (for browsing)
    and Thunderbird (for email). 1.0 launches for both products are now just
    a few months away. To help end users we've started offering CDs (we ship
    more than 5000 CDs for every new release!), telephone support and Mozilla
    wares (our new tshirts are proving to be a big hit). With help from
    David Shea and others, we've also given our web site a make-over.
  </li>
  <li>
    Our friends in Europe have created <a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/">Mozilla Europe</a>, a non-profit organization that's working to promote Mozilla throughout the continent. Similar efforts
    are now underway in other parts of the world.
  </li>
  <li>
    We continue to innovate. Just a few weeks ago, the Mozilla Foundation
    spearheaded an <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/press/mozilla-2004-06-30.html">announcement</a> with Macromedia, Apple, Opera, Sun Microsystems
    and Adobe to deliver a richer plugin experience. Mozilla engineers are
    active participants in the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">WHAT Working Group</a>, a collaborative effort
    with Opera and Apple engineers to bring innovation to web forms and other
    parts of the web.
  </li>
  <li>
    US CERT, a division of the US Department of Homeland Security, recently
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/713878">recommended</a> that Internet Explorer users switch to a different browser
    to avoid dangerous security exploits affecting IE. Secunia, a leading
    third party security firm, also <a href="http://secunia.com/advisories/11793/">recommends</a> using another browser.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The results?
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    5.5 million downloads of Mozilla products in the last 30 days, including over 3 million downloads of Mozilla Firefox.  That's close to 200,000 downloads a day over the last month.
  </li>
  <li>
    More than 300 million page views on our web site for the year. This month
    alone, an estimated 10 million visitors have come to mozilla.org -
    and we're just halfway into the month.
  </li>
  <li>
    Growing buzz for Firefox, with more than 20,000 web sites linking to the
    Firefox product page!
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Most importantly, the tide is finally beginning to turn: after years
  of increasing monopolization of the web browser market, Mozilla-based browsers
  (browsers based on the Gecko rendering engine, that is) are now gaining modest
  but noticeable market share. Both Web Side Story and OneStat.com,
  leading web analytics firms, <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1622837,00.asp">confirm</a> this trend.
</p>

<p>
  All of this terrific news wouldn't have been possible without help
  from lots of individuals and organizations. The Mozilla Foundation is a small
  organization (we employ just a dozen people), but we have lots of friends
  and contributors:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Financial assistance from AOL, IBM, Sun Microsystems and Mitch Kapor
    allowed us to launch the Foundation last year.
  </li>
  <li>
    IBM, Sun Microsystems, Red Hat and others employ dozens of engineers
    who dedicate their full time energy to the Mozilla Foundation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org">MozillaZine</a> has become a lively hub for Mozilla news, community feedback
    and end user support.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.mozdev.org">MozDev</a> is home to hundreds of extensions and other projects that keep
    Mozilla on the leading edge.
  </li>
  <li>
    Close to 4000 individuals have <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/donate.html">donated</a> almost $10,000 per month
    to the Mozilla Foundation.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/marketing/">Visual Identity Team</a> has done an amazing job on the Firefox
    and Thunderbird logos and default themes - and they're not done yet!
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://store.mozilla.org">MozSource</a>, the company that operates the Mozilla Store, ships thousands
    of CDs and Mozilla merchandise every month, processes a good chunk
    of the donations coming to the Mozilla Foundation, and is now sponsoring
    SilverOrange to improve the Mozilla web site. <a href="http://www.silverorange.com">SilverOrange</a> is also doing
    a lot of this work on a volunteer basis.
  </li>
  <li>
    Most importantly: the thousands of hackers and testers who participate
    in producing great software.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  What's next? Firefox and Thunderbird 1.0 - just around the corner.
  But don't wait. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/index.html">Download the preview releases today</a> and help spread the word.
  And if you prefer to go with a proven, mature Internet suite that's been
  around for years, make sure to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/index.html">download Mozilla 1.7</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Help us take back the web!
