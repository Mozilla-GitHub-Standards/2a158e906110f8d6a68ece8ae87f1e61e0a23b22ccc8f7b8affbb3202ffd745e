<h2>--- Section 1: General Questions about the Mozilla Project ---</h2>

<dl><dt>1.1) What is Mozilla?</dt>
<dd>Mozilla is a project to continue Netscape Communicator as an
	open project. The project is maintained by employees of Netscape (now a
	division of AOL), RedHat, some other companies, as well as contributors
	from the community.</dd></dl>
	
<dl><dt>1.2) On what is Mozilla based?</dt>
<dd>The Mozilla project started near the end of life of the 4.x line of
	Netscape Communicator. Originally, the plan was just to re-stabilize
	the code and release 5.0, but it was decided within the community that
	the more ambitious changes that were planned for later integration were
	close to being ready. The old layout engine, networking engine, and several
	of the older modules were gutted, and much later, the sources reached the point
	where Netscape was comfortable making a release, and so Netscape 6.0 was released.
        Netscape 6.0 and above are based off of the Mozilla source.
	Mozilla 1.0 (Mozilla uses a different versioning system than Netscape) is due for
	release soon. </dd></dl>

<dl><dt>1.3) When was Mozilla released?</dt>
<dd>The source to Mozilla was first released on 31 March 1998. The code has
	been continually available since then via CVS (see section 1.8), and
	occasional binary releases (first as milestones, and more recently as
	versioned releases) have been made. As of the time of this update,
	Mozilla 1.0 Release Candicate 2 is the most recent release.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>1.4) What is the current version of Mozilla?</dt>
<dd>Mozilla is continually available via CVS, and also is occasionally released
	as versioned numbers. If built from CVS, the date of the CVS checkout
	is the best way to refer to the version, otherwise use the release
	number. Older versions used milestone numbers (e.g. the Milestone 7 release
	was known as M7).</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>1.5) What is the relation between Mozilla versions and Netscape versions?</dt>
<dd>The current arrangement between Netscape (AOL) and the Mozilla project is that Mozilla
	develops its own releases, and when Netscape (AOL) is preparing to make a release, it
	takes the current version of Mozilla, makes modifications, and does its own QA.
	In return for this, Netscape (AOL) contributes developers to work on the project. The
	Netscape versions may have a different look/feel than Mozilla versions, and also
	may add proprietary features. The Netscape versions are all branded as Netscape (AOL)
	products.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>1.6) What resources are available to the Mozilla community?</dt></dl>
       <p>Webpages:</p>	
       <ul>
	 <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla Project Homepage</a></li>
	 <li><a href="http://devedge.netscape.com">Netscape Developer Program Website</a></li>
	 <li><a href="http://www.mozillazine.org">MozillaZine (News service)</a></li>
         <li><a href="../projects/tech-evangelism">Mozilla Evangelism Effort</a></li>
         <li><a href="http://mozdev.org">MozDev Projects</a></li>
       </ul>

       <p>IRC:</p>
       <ul>
	<li>Server: irc.mozilla.org channel <strong>#mozillazine</strong><br>
	Note that recent versions of Mozilla include an IRC client. Other IRC clients
	can be found at <a href="http://www.irchelp.org">irchelp.org</a>.</li>
       </ul>

<p>Usenet:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All newsgroups in the <i>netscape.public.mozilla.*</i> hierarchy.
		If your news server doesn't carry these, you can use the
		<a href="news://news.mozilla.org">Mozilla news server</a>.
		(Some people receive the newsgroups via a mailing list. Take
		this into consideration when posting things)</li>
</ul>

<p>FTP:</p>
<ul>
	<li>See the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/mirrors.html">Mozilla FTP Mirror section</a> for FTP sites</li>
</ul>

<dl><dt>1.7) Under which license terms was Mozilla released?</dt>
<dd>Mozilla is released under the NPL/MPL (Netscape/Mozilla Public Licenses)
	which are in some ways similar to the GNU GPL, and in some
	ways similar to a BSD-style license. Take a look at
	<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">mozilla.org's NPL area</a>
	for details.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>1.8) What's CVS, and what does it have to do with Mozilla?</dt>
<dd>CVS is a system which is used to synchronize source code
	between developers. It's used to distribute changes to the
	Mozilla source without requiring frequent huge tarballs to be
	downloaded. Check out <a href="http://www.cvshome.com/">
	CVSHome</a> for more info on CVS.
	For specific info on updating your current mozilla source with
	CVS, see <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/cvs.html">mozilla.org's CVS area</a></dd></dl>

<dl><dt>1.9) What are all of the codenames given to various Netscape/Mozilla projects?</dt>
<dd>Gecko (formerly Raptor) is the new HTML rendering engine in
        Mozilla. It features speed improvements, a more modular nature,
	and significantly less platform-dependant code. It is more suitable
	for being embedded in other applications than the previous rendering
	engine. <br><br>

	Gemini was a previous rendering engine project, renamed NGLayout<br>
	Aurora is the Navigation Center in Mozilla and Navigator5<br>
	SeaMonkey refers to versions of Mozilla based on XPFE and NGLayout<br>
	Normandy refers to the Mail/News branch of Mozilla</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>1.10) What are all these acronyms people are using in the newsgroup?</dt>
<dd>Here are a few that are specific to the Mozilla newsgroups:<br><br>

	FE = Front End -- The part of Mozilla that handles the interface<br>
	BE = Back End -- The part of Mozilla that does all the
		behind-the-scenes stuff<br>
	NSPR = Netscape Portable RunTime -- An abstraction layer over
		the local OS<br>
	GTK = A free GUI toolkit native to Unix<br>
	Qt = Another GUI toolkit<br>
	XP = Cross Platform<br>
	XPFE = Cross-platform frontend based on NGLayout<br>
	M[number] = Milestone release [number] (no longer used)</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>1.11) I'm wondering how to do XXX with Navigator 3.x...</dt>
<dd>The mozilla newsgroups are intended to be used by people
	who will be working with Mozilla, either in an organizational
	fashion, suggesting features, or coding. Visit <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape's
	website </a>for help on that software.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>1.12) I went and made a suggestion and people were rude to me. Why?</dt>
<dd>If you posted it to the mailing list/newsgroups, remember that on
	Usenet, people are not always polite to each other. Some people
	are just rude, and some people have a low tolerance for uninformed
	people. If you're new to the mozilla newsgroups, you probably
	should be reading the newsgroup for a few days regularly before
	you post anything. Reading this FAQ might help as well.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>1.13) I did all that, and people were still rude to me. Why?</dt>
<dd>If you're proposing reworking something (like HTTP, HTML, etc)
	you're expected to have a pretty good knowlege of it first.
	For example, if you were to make a proposal to compress whole
	webpages before sending them, devise a new protocol to do
	so, research how HTTP works, how HTML works, and think about
	all the good *and* bad points of reworking things. To start
	understanding the issues with this example, you should dig
	up the RFCs for the relevant protocols, any documents written
	on the subject, etc. For this particular example, you would want
	to go look at</dd></dl>

<h2>--- Section 2: Building Mozilla ---</h2>


<dl><dt>2.1) I get x error when trying to build Mozilla - what's wrong?</dt>
<dd>First, make sure that you have the latest release of the Mozilla
	source. Secondly, ensure that you have fully read the build
	instructions for your platform. These instructions are included
	in the source tree, and are also available on the mozilla website:
</dd></dl>

<p>Detailed build instructions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/unix-details.html">Unix/X</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/win32.html">Win32</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/mac.html">Mac</a></li>
</ul>
<dl><dd>

	If your version of make chokes on the makefiles (on Unix), you
	might not be using GNU make. Grab the latest version of GNU make from
	<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/">The GNU FTP site</a>.

	Regarding shells, I would like to recommend the following:
		If you are using Unix, use bash-family shells
		for the build because of the better control over
		redirection (in case you want to log errors and messages)
		If you are using Win32, using the default shell cmd.exe (as
		opposed to 4DOS or 4NT) will probably yield better results.

	Regarding compilation options, it would be good NOT to compile with
		optimization, because it's much slower to build, and on Windows
		platforms, there's a bug in some versions of VC++ that makes Mozilla crash
		in many common circumstances if compiled with optimization on.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>2.2) What platforms have had successful builds so far?</dt>
<dd>This list will be updated with time, but (according to
	netscape.public.mozilla.general) the following platforms
	have been built successfully:<br>
		Solaris 2.4, 2.5, 2.6<br>
		FreeBSD 2.2, 3.0<br>
		Linux/Intel and Alpha 2.0, 2.1<br>
		MacOS<br>
		WinNT 4.0<br>
		IRIX 5.3, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4<br>
		Win95, Win98<br>
		Digital Unix 4.0<br>
		NetBSD<br>
		OpenBSD<br>
		BSDI<br>
		HP/UX 9.05, 10.20, 11.0 (see 2.7)<br>
		Hurd .03<br>
		DG/UX<br>
                Mac OS X<br><br>
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>2.3) I'm *still* having problems getting mozilla to build on my platform!</dt>
<dd>
	If it's NSPR that's failing to build, take a look at
	config/your_platform.mk, as NSPR still uses the classic build
	system. If it's in mozilla and you're checking out from CVS, check
	tinderbox to see if the tree is on fire. If it is, do another
	CVS pull later. If not, post to netscape.public.mozilla.builds
	or try to fix it yourself. Patches are appreciated.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>2.4) In what directory should I be in order to get a CVS update of the source?</dt>
<dd>You should be at the top of the source (the directory with the
	top-level makefile). If you wish only to refresh a certain area
	of the tree, you can go to that area and do a CVS update there.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>2.5) When I try to use CVS on Windows, I get an error about no home directory</dt>
<dd>You need to set the HOME environment variable to a valid directory,
	as CVS was designed with Unix in mind, and wants to put a file in your
	home directory (the password file)</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>2.6) I'm on a Unix system, and still am having problems building</dt>
<dd>Here's a brief guide to common build problems:<br><br>
			<i>cc1: Invalid option 'foo'<br>
			cc: No such file or directory 'foo'<br></i>
		These are almost always caused by your platform-specific
		Makefile being incorrect for your system, either because
		you're not using the compiler that you're expected to
		(i.e. GCC instead of the Sun Workshop compiler), or because
		you're not using a recognized version of your OS. Go dig
		through the makefiles in config and remove the offending
		portions, and see if that fixes things. If not, post to
		netscape.public.mozilla.builds
		Problems of this sort are currently most likely to happen
		in NSPR, as it still uses the classic build system. It's
		doubtful that this will happen in the main tree. <br><br><i>

		/usr/include/stdlib.h:196: previous declaration of
				`seed48'</i><br><br>
			See section 3.7<br><br>

		<i>Nothing looks much like an error, except something
		returned error status</i><br><br>
		Your compiler has a switch (probably) that prints everything
		it's doing (i.e. programs spawned), which might help you
		find out what arguments it's passing to ld, or whatever, and
		thus perhaps enlighten you as to the problem. On gcc, try
		gcc -v (rest of command line).</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>2.7) How long will Mozilla take to build?</dt>
<dd>A long time, but this will depend quite a bit on your system. RAM
	will probably be the bottleneck in most cases, at least until you are
	well over 128M RAM. Here are a few representative systems (please
	send your specs in to me)<br><br>

	Removed because the tree has changed enough that we'll probably
	need new times for all the builds. Please send stats to me in
	the following format:<br><br>

	CPU/Mhz, Architecture, RAM, disk type,
		OS Version, Compiler version, build type,
		tree date --  build time
<br><br>
	Example:<br>
	21164/533, Alpha, 512M EDO, Ultra2 SCSI,
		Linux kernel 2.2.11, GCC 2.95, non-debug,
		19 August 1999 CVS -- 25 minutes<br><br>


</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>2.8)How do I run the binary on unix? I get library errors</dt>
<dd>In <B>dist/bin</B> there's a script called mozilla.
Use that to launch Mozilla for you -- it sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH automatically.
To launch other binaries from dist/bin with the correct environment, use run-mozilla.sh ./your_binary
</dd></dl>

<hr>

<h2>--- Section 3: Features, Patches ---</h2>

<dl><dt>3.1) What platforms is Mozilla available for?</dt>
<dd>Mozilla is currently targeted for Win32, MacOS, and
	Unix/X systems. Mozilla also runs on Mac OS X, OS/2, and BeOS,
        and ports exist for some other platforms.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>3.2) What does Mozilla lack that Netscape 7 has?</dt>
<dd>Netscape 7 has versions with a number of plugins (which Mozilla.org does
    not have the source for). Netscape 7 also has ICQ/AIM integration, as well
    as integration with an internet radio tool.
	</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>3.3) What does Mozilla have that wasn't in Communicator 4?</dt></dl>

<p>Mozilla has (at least) the following new features:</p>

<ul>
	<li>XML support</li>
	<li>A highly configurable appearance (courtesy of XUL)</li>
	<li>publicly available source code :)</li>
	<li>HTTP compression</li>
	<li>Exists on more platforms</li>
	<li>MathML support (somewhat limited at the moment)</li>
	<li>A significantly faster rendering engine</li>
	<li>Better HTML support (CSS 1 and partial CSS 2, DOM 1 and partial DOM 2)</li>
	<li>Plug-in JVM support</li>
        <li>Tabbed browsing</li>
        <li>Message filtering</li>
        <li>An IRC client</li>
</ul>

<dl><dt>3.4) Why is the animated icon different?</dt>
<dd>The N logo is only to be present on Netscape's Communicator.
	This will serve as a way for an end-user to determine if they
	have Mozilla or Communicator. The icon that's distributed in
	the source will be used in mozilla.org distributions of Mozilla.
	The first 3 tarballs had a simple sample logo, whereas the current
	source includes an icon from the community that won a contest.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>3.5) Where can I get a binary?</dt>
<dd>mozilla.org now provides Mozilla binaries. Both nightly builds
	and numbered releases are available, numbered releases being
	made less frequently but with more of an emphasis on stability.
	You can find the binaries at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">Mozilla.org's Binaries page</a> </dd></dl>

<dl><dt>3.6) On Win32, it fails to build, with the message <I>'.\WIN32' unexpected</I></dt>
<dd>You didn't properly set the environment variables -- you must not
	include a space at the end of the set statements (be careful if
	you are cut'n'pasting).</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>3.7) On Unix, it fails to build, with complaints about lcong48 and seed48!</dt>
<dd>You probably have GCC 2.8.1, which currently won't work
	with Mozilla. Get 2.8.0 or 2.7.2+ (2.8.0 has some problems, 2.7.2 would
	be best, at least until the problems with 2.8.1 are ironed out)</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>3.8)Where can I get the sources to Netscape 4.x or lower?</dt>
<dd>These sources are not available. Much of the old code cannot be released
	due to legal concerns, and at the time of Mozilla's initial release,
	that code was removed from the tree. The 'Classic' branch of the
	current CVS tree is as close to the 4.x source as the public will
	ever see, although that branch has been abandoned in the move to
	the modern codebase.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>3.9)Removed</dt>
<dd>Removed
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>3.10) How do I tweak the interface (replace the logo, etc)?</dt>
<dd>The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe/xptoolkit/">XPToolkit docs</a> might help
	in writing the needed XUL. You can find replacement themes in Preferences,
        under Appearance->Themes, using the 'get new themes' link there.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>3.11) Where can I get patches?</dt>
<dd>There is not currently a central repository of patches. However,
	via CVS, you can keep up with the latest source from Mozilla.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>3.12) I made a patch! How do I submit it?</dt>
<dd>The current best way to do this is to post it in 
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a>, either attached to the bug
	it fixes or a new entry describing what it changes. If that doesn't work, it also
	could be posted in diff format in the newsgroup.
	<i>netscape.public.mozilla.patches</i>
	Note that context-sensitive patches (diff -c)
	are preferred over other formats.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>3.13) I want to add X feature to Mozilla. Who do I contact?</dt>
<dd>First, you should make sure that Mozilla doesn't already have the
	feature you wish to add. There have been changes since Communicator
	4.0. Check out section 3 for details. Assured that it's not already
	there, you should post to the mozilla usenet groups, asking for
	help. Finally, you should make sure that someone is not already
	working on the code you would need to modify to implement your
	feature. On www.mozilla.org, there is a list of	module 'owners'.
	This system ensures that 2 people are not working on the same
	part at the same time. Check for for the module owner, and
	contact him/her. The specific area that you can find this is on
	the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/owners.html">Mozilla Owners Document</a>.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>3.14)How do I embed Mozilla's rendering engine into my application?</dt>
<dd>Check out <b>GTKmozilla</b> in your tree at <b>webshell/embed/gtk</b> for
	an example of how to do this</dd></dl>

<hr>

<h2>--- Section 4: Common Topics of Discussion ---</h2>

<dl><dt>4.0) What's this section about?</dt>
<dd>This section is to prevent rehashing of the same debates
	over and over again on the newsgroups. It might slightly
	reflect the opinions of Pat Gunn, and if you're really angry
	about this, drop him an email at <a href="mailto:qc@apk.net">qc@apk.net</a>
	I'll try to keep this section with only debates that are frequent
	that seem to have a right answer.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>4.1) How about a Mozilla Operating System?</dt>
<dd>Mozilla is positioned well as an application software. However,
	it makes very little sense to try to make Mozilla into an operating
	sense, almost as little sense as it would to make a Word Processor
	or a MP3 player into one. Beyond technical reasons, the operating
	system market is currently glutted, and a new entry would be
	unlikely to attract enough users to ensure the writing of drivers
	for a new system, a critical mass point. People who want to work
	on an operating system no doubt would be welcomed by the
	BSD teams, the Linux team, the Freedows team, or any of the many
	other open source operating system groups out there.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>4.2) How about a Netscape release of Linux?</dt>
<dd>This isn't quite so far fetched, but it has the problem of possibly
	doing a great deal of harm to the relations between Netscape
	and several Unix vendors who bundle Netscape's servers. It is
	unlikely that Netscape would do anything that would endanger
	its revenue stream. As another point, there are already plenty
	of Linux distributions out there, most of them doing a pretty good
	job of making a usable system. Reinvention of the wheel is a poor
	use of volunteers.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>4.3) Why don't we make a way to compress all the components of a webpage
		into one big file, and send that across?</dt>
<dd>This breaks a lot of things that work currently. It is very
	difficult to determine what components of the webpage actually
	needs -- certain images may be shared between several pages,
	the user may have images turned off or lack capabilities to use
	a certain type of media. Dynamically generated pages make this
	nearly impossible. Devising a system that would handle all of
	these situations would make web servers more complex, slower,
	and likely hurt the transfer time that this proposal is attempting
	to save. Also, progressive display of the webpage would be
	completely gone with this idea. For these reasons, this is
	generally considered a bad idea.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>4.4) I'd like to port Mozilla to XXXOS. Any advice?</dt>
<dd>If you're targeting a relatively recent Unix, you probably will have
	very few problems. Otherwise, the more Unixlike the target system
	is, the easier your port will go. I would suggest that before you
	devote much time and effort to your port, you consider:<br><br>
		<small>How many users the OS has that are likely to use Mozilla<br>
		Does the OS support multitasking well enough for Mozilla<br>
		Does the OS have a sufficiently evolved GUI for Mozilla to work<br>
		Does the OS have sufficient networking support for Mozilla<br>
		Is the OS typically run on systems that have the resources
			to run Mozilla<br>
		Does GCC or some other easily available compiler exist
			for the target platform<br><br></small>
	If many of these answers are no, then there will be large issues
	that will hamper the port. This is not meant to state that the
	port is not worthwhile, but that it will be difficult. </dd></dl>

<h2>--- Section 5: How to help ---</h2>

<dl><dt>5.1) What projects are there for programmers?</dt></dl>

<p>This project is largely about coding. You could tackle:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Porting Mozilla to the OS you use</li>
	<li>Work on moving <b>#ifdef PLATFORM</b> to <b>#ifdef FEATURE/BUG</b></li>
	<li>If you're on Unix, port Mozilla to the toolkit you prefer</li>
	<li>Modularize/Clean up APIs</li>
	<li>Fix Bugs</li>
	<li>Work on the expermental features (Mail/News, Aurora, NGLayout)</li>
	<li>Add new things:<br>
		Make OpenDoc and OLE NGLayout controls<br>
		Write new skins (see themes.org)<br>
		Add preference interfaces for the hidden features</li>
	<li>There's plenty to do..</li>
</ul>

<dl><dt>5.2) What subprojects are there for documentation people?</dt>
<dd>Mozilla currently has far more developers than documenters. As a result, the
	project is in dire need of documentation work. Maintenance of old documentation
	would be helpful, new documentation is also welcome. Post to
	netscape.public.mozilla.documentation your intent, and you might get some help.
	</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>5.3) What projects are there for others?</dt></dl>

<p>There are some important things that you can do if you don't code
	or care to document:</p>
<ul>	<li>Ideas - If you have an idea for what you'd like to see in Mozilla, post
		a feature request to Bugzilla</li>
	<li>Artwork - Design new icons and other resources for Mozilla</li>
	<li>Use Talkback - Talkback-enabled builds help the community by letting
		Mozilla.org members where in the code crashes occur.</li>
</ul>
<dl><dt>5.4) What's the best way to feel part of the community and talk to other developers?</dt>
<dd>Be sure to read and participate on the relevant newsgroups and drop by
	on IRC. Both are great ways to meet others working on mozilla, including
	lots of netscape employees as well as other interested people (like myself).
	To get an IRC client, go to <a href="http://www.irchelp.org">this site</a>

<h2>--- Section 6: Meta Information ---</h2>

<dl><dt>6.1) What changed since the last version?</dt>
<dd>Added a new 3.8
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>6.2) What other versions of this FAQ are out there?</dt>
<dd>Various other people have decided to take the original of this FAQ
	and modify it, usually making a web version. Some of these have
	more (or less) information than this FAQ includes.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>6.3) Does the author mind if I make my own version, HTMLify it, or whatever?</dt>
<dd>Nope. Go for it. I would suggest you try to keep looking at mine
	occasionally, so you can add new things that I do, but you can
	do whatever you want to with it.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>6.4) The FAQ is wrong on section X.X! What can I do about it?</dt>
<dd>Drop a note to <a href="mailto:qc@apk.net">Pat Gunn </a>. Alternatively,
	post a bug on the FAQ to <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org">BugZilla</a>.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>6.5) Help! I'm getting spam from Mozilla</dt>
<dd>You probably arn't really getting spam from mozilla. If you think you're
	getting it from mozilla because the X-Mailer field mentions Mozilla,
	then you're misinterpreting the meaning of the X-Mailer field --
	it indicates that the sender is *using* Netscape Communicator to
	deliver the mail. If you're getting mail contents of one of the
	mozilla newsgroups, it's likely because you subscribed (or someone
	subscribed you) to the mailing list form of those groups. As to the
	first case, there's no connection between the Mozilla project and
	the spam. You might want to visit <a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/Abuse/Spam/">The Open Directory Project's spam pages</a> to help you track
	down the origin. For the second case, go to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/community.html">The Mozilla
	Community section</a> to unsubscribe</dd></dl>
