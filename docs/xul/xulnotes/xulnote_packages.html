<a name="intro"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<P>Mozilla has introduced major changes to the way that themes and all the other parts of 
the UI are packaged. Under the <b>chrome\</b> directory in recent builds, you'll notice that
in addition to the package subdirectories, there are now also a handful of JAR files, 
or Java archives (see figure below). These archives are redundant with the subdirectories:
Mozilla now installs both the compressed and uncompressed versions of the UI, though you can
change this when you build Mozilla yourself.</P>

<P>In addition to these JAR files, there are also several new RDF files. 
These new files represent a redesign of the way that the 
Mozilla UI is packaged and installed. Though the chrome directory still includes
subdirectories of uncompressed files by default, a new way to aggregate and distribute 
the files has improved performance, made the UI components more portable and easier 
to install, and made the installation process a much easier one.</P>

<blockquote>
<img src="chrome_dir.gif" border="1" />
</blockquote>

<P>However, this new arrangement does not make things much easier for
the web or user interface developer. The relatively simple process of
finding the appropriate resources (i.e., XUL, JavaScript, or CSS
files) in the chrome subdirectories and editing them with a text editor
has been replaced by something a lot of developers find more confusing
and esoteric. This article describes the new packaging scheme of the
Mozilla and offers a tutorial for creating a new package that can then
be redistributed, installed, and made available to users.

<a name="new"></a>
<H2>The New Packaging Scheme</H2>
<p>A complete description of the new packaging scheme is beyond the scope of this 
article. The reader is referred to a recent addition to the mozilla.org website, 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/jar-packaging.html">Jar Packaging</a>,
which describes the design, goals, and options available for jar packaging in some depth.
What follows is a <i>very</i> brief overview of the design and a description of 
what Mozilla expects in installable packages.

<P>Resources are collected in JAR archives whose contents are specified in
<i>contents.rdf</i> files at their own top level. The <i>contents.rdf</i> file 
explains the structure and contents of the archive to Mozilla's chrome registry; 
as long as the explanation is accurate, the contents can be arranged in almost
any way you want. In the package you create in this tutorial, for example, all
of the resources are located under the <b>content\</b> subdirectory, but
they could just as easily have been archived directly at the top--along with
skin and locale resources, if you wanted.

<P>Where before a single <i>manifest.rdf</i> file described the resources
in an entire package directory or archive, now <i>contents.rdf</i> files can
be used for as large or as small a part of your package description as you want;
you can use several <i>contents.rdf</i> files in your package to describe the
various parts (e.g., one for the skin of your package, another for the content, 
and so on), or you can use a single one, as was common before.

<P>Mozilla is alerted to these content specifications and the resources they
manage either through registration as part of an installation process 
(as described in this tutorial) or by way of a shortcut file
called <tt>installed-chrome.txt</tt>, in which developers can point at their
new contents.rdf files and have them registered as they develop 
(a process we do not describe here). One way of another, the chrome registry
is shown the contents.rdf files; the contents.rdf files in turn point to new
resources, and the resources are then registered with Mozilla and accessible to the
user.

<a name="create"></a>
<h2>Creating a New Package</h2>

<p>The package described in this section is a very simple one, but it uses the 
new packaging scheme and the chrome registry to make itself a piece of self-contained 
and redistributable software. Once you have created a package like the one described
here, Mozilla users can download and install it in a single step.</P>

<H3>The Barley Package</H3>
<p>The barley package is a simple XUL window with a couple of buttons and an image element.
One of the buttons, labeled "show aphids", displays an alert dialog by calling a function 
defined in the JavaScript file <i>barley.js</i>.
<blockquote>
<img src="barley_win.gif" border="1" />
</blockquote>

<P>Since we are not updating the Mozilla UI to provide special access to this window
(e.g., an item in the Tasks menu or elsewhere), the measure of the success of the installation 
of the barley package is that the user can, as before, invoke our software by using
a special startup option:

<blockquote>
<pre>
mozilla -chrome chrome://barley/content
</pre>
</blockquote>

<P>This option tells Mozilla to load a chrome other than the default, which is the main
browser window. For this option to work, the designated chrome must have been installed
and registered properly with Mozilla. The chrome:// url pointer corresponds to the
directory Mozilla/bin/chrome/barley/content, where the main XUL file and the other
resources live once they are installed.

<H3>Package Creation Overview</H3>
<P>This tutorial describes the following sequence of steps for creating a new package:
<ul>
<li><a href="#xul">Developing the Resources</a>
<li><a href="#organize">Organizing the Resources</a>
<li><a href="#contents">Creating the contents.rdf File</a>
<li><a href="#install">Making the Barley Install Script</a>
<li><a href="#xpi">Creating a XPI</a>
</ul>

<P>You can examine (or install!) the package described here 
by downloading the following XPI file and using zip software to open it.
<ul><li><a href="barley.xpi">barley.xpi</a>
</ul>
<P>All of the resources described in this article are in the XPI archive
and can be adapted for use in your own development.

<a name="xul"></a>
<H3>Developing the Resources</H3>
<P>Needless to say, one of the first things you will have to create is the actual software 
you wish to make redistributable. The Barley package UI is a single XUL window with 
an accompanying image:

<blockquote>
<table><tr><td style="background-color: #eee;">
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="chrome://communicator/skin/" type="text/css"?>

&lt;window title="barley window"
  xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"
  width="175" height="375" x="20" y="20" persist="width height x y" 
  orient="vertical"
  autostretch="always">

  &lt;script src="<font color="darkblue">barley.js</font>"/>

  &lt;image src="<font color="darkblue">barley.gif</font>" />
    &lt;box orient="horizontal" autostretch="never">
      &lt;button label="barley corn" />
      &lt;button label="show aphids" onclick="bar();" />
    &lt;/box>
&lt;/window>
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</blockquote>

<P>The other files that the window imports are defined in <font color="darkblue">dark blue</font>. Note that the stylesheet
processing instruction at the top of the XUL file does not refer to any new skin, but imports
communicator.css to make use of that skin's basic widget styles.

<P>The JavaScript file <i>barley.js</i> contains a single function, bar(), defined as follows:
<blockquote>
<table><tr><td style="background-color: #eee;">
<pre>
function bar() {
	alert("aphids");
}
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</blockquote>

<P>If you want to use the same GIF image that is used in the Barley package, it
can be grabbed from <a href="barley.gif">here</a>.

<P>While you are developing these resources and before you have made them a package 
of their own, you can test the basic layout and functionality by opening <I>barley.xul</I>
from within Mozilla by using File -> Open. Though Mozilla will not display the file
as a separate window (much less interpret it as a separate package), you ought to be
able to see the image and the JavaScript function working as defined in <i>barley.js</i>
(provided that both all three files are in the same working directory).

<a name="organize"></a>
<H3>Organizing the Resources</H3>
<P>Now that you have created the basic files to be included in your package, you should
put them all in a single directory so that they can be bundled up. When your package includes
its own theme, localization packs, or other components it's convenient (but not necessary
to create a subdirectory structure that reflects the role of the different parts. For
the Barley package, you only need to create a single subdirectory, <b>content\</b>
(see figure below).

<blockquote>
<img src="barley_dir.gif" border="1" />
</blockquote>

<a name="contents"></a>
<h3>Creating the contents.rdf File</h3>

<P>One of the most important ingredients of the software package is the <i>contents.rdf</i> 
file that describes the contents of the package in terms that the chrome registry can make
sense of. For a package such as this one with its own content but no special localization
or custom skin, the <i>contents.rdf</i> file describes package in terms of its relation
to the "root" package of Mozilla. In the following listing, the items in red are particular
to the barley package and can be edited for your own distribution:

<blockquote>
<table><tr><td style="background-color: #eee;">
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;RDF:RDF xmlns:RDF="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
 xmlns:chrome="http://www.mozilla.org/rdf/chrome#">

 <font color="green">&lt;!-- list all the packages being supplied --></font>
 &lt;RDF:Seq about="urn:mozilla:package:root">
   &lt;RDF:li resource="urn:mozilla:package:<font color="darkred">barley</font>"/>
 &lt;/RDF:Seq>

 <font color="green">&lt;!-- package information --></font>
 &lt;RDF:Description about="urn:mozilla:package:<font color="darkred">barley</font>"
   chrome:displayName="<font color="darkred">Barley Grain</font>"
   chrome:author="<font color="darkred">Ian Oeschger</font>"
   chrome:name="<font color="darkred">barley</font>">
 &lt;/RDF:Description>

&lt;/RDF:RDF>
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</blockquote>

<P>Create a contents.rdf file like the one in the listing above and put it in the <b>contents\</b>
subdirectory with the other package resources.

<blockquote>
<img src="barley_contents.gif" border="1" />
</blockquote>

<P>These four files are all you need in your new package. The next step is to zip up the contents of
the working directory. Using WinZip or another shareware ZIP software program, create a new archive
of the contents\ subdirectory and name it <i>barley.jar</i>:

<blockquote>
<img src="barley_jar.gif" border="1" />
</blockquote>

<P>Once this step is complete, the Barley package is in the same state as the JAR packages
of the Mozilla UI. <i>comm.jar</i>, <i>en-US.jar</i>, and all of the other archived
UI packages have a similar--if slightly more complex--structure and content specification
as the <i>barley.jar</i>

<a name="install"></a>
<H3>Making the Barley Install Script</H3>
<p>What remains is to package up your JAR file in such a way that it can be installed using
Mozilla's XPInstall technology. The XPI file format (pronounced "zippy") is used to designate
archives that use Mozilla's XPInstall to install themselves. An XPI file typically contains
the resources to be installed (in this case the <i>barley.jar</i> we want to have installed
in the Mozilla/bin/chrome directory) and an install script that guides the installation process.

<P>For Barley, that installation script should read as follows:

<blockquote>
<table><tr><td style="background-color: #eee;">
<pre>
<font color="green">// initInstall(<i>name + version</i>, <i>name</i>, <i>version</i>); </font>
var err = initInstall("<font color="darkred">barley v</font>", "<font color="darkred">barley</font>", ""); 
logComment("initInstall: " + err);

addFile("<font color="darkred">Barley Grain</font>",      <font color="green"> // displayName from contents.rdf </font>
  "<font color="darkred">barley.jar</font>", 	      <font color="green">// jar source </font>
  getFolder("Chrome"),      <font color="green">  // target folder </font>
  "");                       <font color="green"> // target subdir </font>

<font color="green">// registerChrome(<i>TYPE</i>, <i>location</i>, <i>source</i>)</font>
registerChrome(PACKAGE | DELAYED_CHROME, getFolder("Chrome","<font color="darkred">barley.jar</font>"), "<font color="darkred">content/</font>");

if (err==SUCCESS)
  performInstall(); 
else
  cancelInstall(err);
</pre></td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<P>Note that there is no version number on Barley, and so the <i>name + version</i> parameter has a "v" and then nothing else.
Note also the use of resource attributes specified in the <i>contents.rdf</i> file in the JAR. It is the 
correspondence of this installation script, the resources themselves, and the contents.rdf file that registers the 
package and makes it available.

<a name="xpi"></a>
<H3>Creating a XPI</H3>
<P>The final step in the tutorial is to create a XPI archive in which the <i>install.js</i> script and the <i>barley.jar</i>
can be redistributed. The archiving of an archive may seem a little redundant--and if you want you can instead use the
XPI to archive the install script and "flat", or uncompressed, versions of the resources. But the XPI puts all of 
the resources of your package together, including the instructions for installing it. Like the JAR format that Mozilla uses to archive the UI packages, the XPI format is just a specially-ordered ZIP file. For a XPI file to be valid and installable, it must contain an installation script like the one above that tells Mozilla XPInstall where to put the new resources and how to register them.

<P>To create a XPI, use your zip software again to archive the JAR file and the installation script <i>install.js</i>. The archive,
named barley.xpi, should have the following two files:

<blockquote>
<img src="barley_xpi.gif" border="1" />
</blockquote>

<P>This file, when opened from Mozilla using File -> Open, will initialize its own installation and display a message like the following:

<blockquote>
<img src="barley_dlog.gif" border="1" />
</blockquote>

<P>When you click OK, Mozilla installs the new package. Exit Mozilla and restart it with <tt>mozilla -chrome chrome://barley/content</tt>, and the new package displays. The resources are installed in the <b>mozilla\bin\chrome\</b> directory, and the XPI itself can be redistributed for installation on other machines.
