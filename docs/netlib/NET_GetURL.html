URL_s (ns\include\net.h) - A pointer to a url struct which describes the
url to retrieve.
<BR>output_format - An FO_Present_Type which describes the context that
the url data retrieved will go to.
<BR>window_id - A pointer to the context.
<BR>exit_routine - A pointer to the function to be called (prior to completion)
when the url has been completely processed.

<FONT COLOR="#3333FF">Returns:</FONT></H4>
An integer. If the return value is less than zero on error, or if the entire
transfer completed during the first call. Otherwise it returns zero or
greater.

<P>A call to NET_GetURL() is made when a caller wants to receive or send
data. How the data is received or sent (including whether data should be
received or sent) is determined by the properties of the URL_Struct passed
in. One of the first things NET_GetURL() does is parse the url to determine
what scheme/protocol (i.e. http, ftp, data) it's dealing with. It then
determines whether a proxy auto-configuration file or proxy config file
is to be used. If so the config file is loaded first, putting the orginal
url in a temporary queue which will call NET_GetURL() again once the config
file is loaded. The total number of processing urls count is incremented.
If a plugin is supposed to handle the url, it takes over processing and
it will call the exit_routine passed in, NET_GetURL() won't. If the url
passed in only contains the two forward slashes after the <I>scheme</I>:,
and no others, one slash is appended to the end.

<P>Next, the cache is consulted for existance of the url. If the url exists
in the cache and hasn't expired, it is used. If the there's room for processing
(eg. the maximun number of connections won't be exceeded), continue processing.
Otherwise place the url on the wait queue which will call NET_GetURL()
with it later.

<P>At this point a new entry (type ActiveEntry) is created, intiailized
(includes adding the passed in URL_Struct to a member variable) and added
to the entry list. If we have a config file (loaded from a previous call
to NET_GetURL(), see above), ask it whether or not a proxy or socks server
is supposed to be used for this url. If so, add it to the entry properties
so it gets used later in processing.

<P>Finally, a protocol implementation is found for the given url, hooked
up with it's active entry, and the protocol implementation's init routine
is run.
