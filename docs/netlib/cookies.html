netlib Cookies</H1>
Cookies evolved so state could be maintained in the otherwise stateless
http protocol. They were introduced in version 1.0 of Netscape Navigator
and are implemented by extending http headers which are a part of the http
protocol 1.0 and higher. As of the first free source release, netlib supports
the <A href="http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">original
cookie specification</A>. None of Netscape's (or Mozilla's as of the first
free source release) browsers are RFC 2109 compliant.

<A NAME="response"></A>Server Response</H4>
When an http response is parsed by netlib via a call to net_parse_http_mime_headers(),
if a "Set-Cookie:" header is found, NET_SetCookieStringFromHttp() is called.
NET_SetCookieStringFromHttp() calls the private net_IntSetCookieString()
function after making the cookie expiration time relative to the GMT as
reported by the server date. This is done to compensate for client systems
that don't have any concept of timezone (i.e. dos systems that don't have
the TZ environment variable set). net_IntSetCookieString() parses the cookie
attributes out of the Set-Cookie header and copies them into a net_CookieStruct
(defined in ns/lib/libnet/mkaccess.c), which is added to the netlib cookie
list in memory.

<P>As of the first free source release, when javascript cookie is set,
NET_SetCookieString() is called which simply wraps a net_IntSetCookieString()
call. Javascript cookie setting code should be modified to call NET_SetCookieStringFromHttp()
so it can have the same expiration time protection.
<H4>
<A NAME="request"></A>Client Request</H4>
When the http headers are being constructed for an http url request (GET,
POST, or otherwise) via a call to net_build_http_request(), the NET_GetCookie()
function is called to determine whether or not a cookie, or cookies, should
be sent along with the http request. NET_GetCookie() has the current url
string passed into it. NET_GetCookie() searches the netlib cookie list
for any cookies that should be sent along in the http request. If it finds
a cookie, or cookies, based on the criteria outlined in the <A href="http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">original
cookie specification</A> it allocates a string as a char* and returns it
to the calling net_build_http_request() for inclusion in the http headers.

<P><I>Every</I> http request prompts a call to NET_GetCookie(). If cookies
are disabled, NET_GetCookie() will never return anything.
<H4>
<A NAME="foreign"></A>Foreign Cookies</H4>
The <A href="http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">original
cookie specification</A> allows cookies from servers other than the one
your main document resides on to be set. These cookies are refered to as
foreign cookies. Netscape client's 4.x and higher allow users to configure
they're clients to not accept foreign cookies. If the client has been configured
not to accept foreign cookies, net_IntSetCookieString() compares the host
of the document currently being viewed (the url most recently accessed
in the session history database) with the one in the url that is setting
the cookie; if they don't match, the cookie is not set.
<H4>
<A NAME="persistance"></A>Cookie Persistance</H4>
Each profile has a cookies text file that resides in the root profile directory.
This file contains formatted ascii text and contains all the cookies that
haven't expired. The file is written out everytime a cookie changes (is
added or modified) in the netlib cookie list (the file is only written
out at the end of the session in Navigator 3.x and lower). Cookies are
read from the file and parsed into net_CookieStructs then added to the
netlib cookie list during netlib initialization which occurs only once,
at the beginning of a session.

<P>As of the first free source release cookies are only removed from the
netlib cookie list (expired) when a call to NET_DisplayCookieInfoAsHTML()
(about:cookies), or NET_RemoveAllCookies() is made. However, cookies that
have expired are never sent and are not written to disk.
<H4>
<A NAME="filters"></A>Javascript Cookie Filters</H4>
As of the first free source release cookies can be filtered via javascript
functions. There is no ui for this feature. In order to filter cookies
via javascript, two things need to be done: the line, <TT>user_pref("network.cookie.filterName",
"cookieFilterFunctionName");</TT>, must appear in the user's pref file,
and a javascript file defining the cookieFilterFunction (the function can
have any name, it must match the name in the pref file) must be created
in the same directory as the cookies text file. The javascript cookie determine
whether a cookie should be accepted, rejected, or confirmed by the user,
based on any of the information provided in the javascript cookie object
(<A HREF="#cookieObj">see netlib javascript cookie object description below</A>).

<P>If the user's configuration is set to:
<UL>
<LI>
"Accept all cookies" - the javascript cookie filter function is executed
if it exists (i.e. the two criteria above are met).</LI>

<LI>
"Only accept cookies that get sent back to the originating server" - (i.e.
don't accept foreign cookies) the javascript cookie filter function is
ignored only if a foreign cookie is encountered, otherwise it is executed
if it exists.</LI>

<LI>
"Disable Cookies" - the javascript cookie filter function is ignored.</LI>

<LI>
"Warn me before accepting a cookie" - the javascript cookie filter function
is executed if it exists and overrides the warning preference.</LI>
</UL>
Here's a sample <A HREF="cookies.js.txt">cookies.js</A> file. This file
can be used to filter cookies if you place it in the same directory as
your cookies text file and add the user_pref line described above. You
can then edit the values in the arrays to determine how you want your cookies
accepted, rejected, or confirmed.

<A NAME="cookieObj"></A>netlib Javascript Cookie Object</H4>
The netlib javascript cookie object has the following properties.
