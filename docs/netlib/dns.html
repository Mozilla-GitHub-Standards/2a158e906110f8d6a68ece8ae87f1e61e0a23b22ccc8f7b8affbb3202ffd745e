netlib dns</H1>
<B>implementation:</B> ns/lib/libnet/mkconenct.c
<BR><B>see:</B> net_FindAddress()

<P>In order to resolve host names, netlib uses the standard dns lookup
mechanism. net_FindAddress() makes the gethostbyname call to lookup the
ip address for the specified host, and is called from NET_BeginConnect().
If a numeric ip address is passed into net_FindAddress(), it is passed
directly into the getHostByName call which will always return success when
an ip address is passed in. If a successful lookup is made, the result
is cached in the netlib dns cache (a simple XP_List struct) for a default
time of 900 seconds (15 minutes). The dns cache expiration time is user
configurable via the prefs.js file, simply add/edit this line:

<P><TT>user_pref("network.dnsCacheExpiration", 900);</TT>

<P>Dns lookup behavior can be asynchronous or not, depending on whether
or not a front end specific async dns lookup routine is provided. If an
async routine is provided, the host name is passed into it along with a
host entity structure. The first call to the async routine returns the
"waiting for lookup" value immediately so execution is not blocked, and
the next_state variable for that connection is updated to "NET_TCP_FINISH_DNS_LOOKUP"
so netlib knows to call net_FindAddress() again to get the result of the
lookup. net_FindAddress() is actually called repeatedly until it returns
success or failure. Upon success the host entity struct is filled out,
and cached. Upon failure, the host entity struct is freed and the "not
found" result is passed back up to the caller.

<P>If no async routine is provided, net_FindAddress() makes a direct, blocking
call to PR_GetHostByName(). If this call returns success, the host entity
is cached, otherwise memory is free'd and the "not found" result is passed
back up to the caller.
<H4>
Unix</H4>
On unix platforms netlib provides nonblocking dns lookup behavior by implementing
it's own routines that maintain an array, on a separate thread, of forked
processes, each of which makes a blocking gethostbyname call.
<H4>
Round Robin Support</H4>
A single host name may resolve to multiple ip addresses, each of which
is stored in the host entity returned after a successful lookup. Netlib
preserves the order in which the dns server returns the ip addresses. If
at any point during a connection, the ip address currently in use for a
host name fails, netlib will use the next ip address stored in the host
entity. If that one fails, the next is queried, and so on. This progression
through available ip address is accomplished in the NET_FinishConnect()
function. Before a url load is considered complete because it's connection
went foul, it's host entity is consulted to determine whether or not another
ip address should be tried for the given host. Once an ip address fails,
it's out, removed from the host entity in the cache. If all ip addresses
in the host entity fail, netlib propegates the "server not responding"
error back up the call chain.

<P>Netlib used to select an ip address from a particular host's entity
structure at random, however, since dns servers themselves have started
to employ load balancing algorithms to determine in what order to return
the ip address.
<H4>
TTL (Time To Live)</H4>
A dns A-record has a field that designates a ttl time. This ttl time indicates
how long a particular ip address should be valid, and would ideally be
consulted during/after a dns lookup to determine how long to cache the
host entity. However, netlib has not been in the business of working with
dns at this level, it instead relies on nspr's host name lookup routines
with currently map to system host name lookup routines, which do not provide
this level of visibility into the dns lookup. <I>Netlib doesn't use ttl's
to do smarter caching because ttl's haven't made it through the host name
lookup apis.</I>
