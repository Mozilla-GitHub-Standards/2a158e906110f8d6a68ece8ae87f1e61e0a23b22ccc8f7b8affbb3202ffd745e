netlib Initialization</H1>
Before any netlib functions can be called, it needs to be initialized.
This is accomplished via a call to NET_InitNetLib(). The function takes
two arguments; the first is the size of socket buffers netlib should use,
the second is the maximum number of connections that netlib can open. The
maximum number of connections my differ from the number passed in depending
on platform. For example, dos has a low limit on the maximum number of
file descriptors that can be open, thus, the number passed into NET_InitNetLib()
may be reduced.

<P>NET_InitNetLib() initializes netlib related lists, the cache, reads
cookies from file, registers preference callbacks (this registration process
provides a notification scheme so netlib can receive events based on user
preference changes), and calls protocol implementation initialization routines.
