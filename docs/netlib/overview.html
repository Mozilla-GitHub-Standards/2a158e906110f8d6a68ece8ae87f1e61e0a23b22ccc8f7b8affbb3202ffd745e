<FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT>t the heart of Netscape client products lies the
Netscape Network Library (netlib). The underlying mission of any network
library is to move data (html files, images, etc.) over a network connection.
You'll soon learn that Netscape's netlib responsibilities have grown over
the years to encompass more functionality than simple data movement, however,
the mission core remains the same.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT> necessity of any network based client app is
to send and receive data over a connection. This is accomplished in netlib
by making a call to <A HREF="NET_GetURL.html">NET_GetURL()</A>. Among <A HREF="NET_GetURL.html">NET_GetURL()'s</A>
arguments is a URL_Struct which contains the actual url to be retrieved.
When a call to <A HREF="NET_GetURL.html">NET_GetURL()</A> is made, a connection
is established between the client making the request and the host machine
named in the url, a request is sent in a particular format specified by
the protocol (i.e. http, ftp), and data is received by the client, from
the host machine. Now, there is a considerable amount of activity that
takes place to accomplish this, and there are many issues to consider before
retrieving the data; should a proxy be used to retrieve the data, does
the data already reside locally (in part or in whole) in the cache, how
do we give focus back to the calling application while data is in transit
(you don't want your application to lock up, waiting for the data, do you?),
and so on. These issues are part of netlib's responsibility to resolve
and take appropriate action. These issues are discussed in pertinent sections
of this documentation.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>O</FONT>nce data has been retrieved over the network,
it has to be interpreted, otherwise it's meaningless. Once data is received
(or before data is sent), it is in a stream. Content type converters register
themselves as stream handlers, and do the interpretation. Content type
converters are registered with a call to NET_RegisterContentTypeConverter().
This registration call associates a function pointer with a particular
stream type (mime-type), which is called when a stream of this type arrives.
It then becomes the responsibility of the converter, not netlib's, to interpret
the data coming down the stream. Recall that netlib simply moves the data
back and forth, it doesn't know anything about it. Perhaps the data coming
in is html in which case whichever converter registered itself to handle
html for the given context (<A HREF="streams.html">see Streams for more
info.</A>) will handle it. In the browser context, the converter would
wind up displaying the data in the browser window.

<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>R</FONT>arely is a client in an environment in which
it establishes only one connection to retrieve only one url. Most of today's
web pages consist of some html text and multiple images. This fact requires
netlib to be able to process many urls "simultaneously." Simultaneously
as far as perception is concerned. This can be accomplished in several
ways. One solution would be to create a new thread for each url to retrieve,
and call <A HREF="NET_GetURL.html">NET_GetURL()</A> on each new thread.
For many reasons, this is not what netlib does. Another solution, which
netlib employs, involves a list of urls currently being processed (active
urls), which netlib maintains (adds a url to the list when a call to <A HREF="NET_GetURL.html">NET_GetURL()</A>
is made, and removes a url from it when it's been completed) and continuously
processes. If there are active entries in this list, netlib "processes"
one of them for a timeslice, then passes focus back to the loop. The loop
is aware that active entries still exist, and calls back into netlib (via
a call to <A HREF="NET_ProcessNet.html">NET_ProcessNet()</A>) so more processing
occurs. This looping continues until all active entries are gone (all urls
have been retrieved). Netlib runs in the main mozilla thread and is not
designed for multithread use, it instead relies on this loop-back call
mechanism and the asynchronous nature of each <A HREF="protoImps.html">protocol
implementation</A> to handle multiple connections simultaneously.
