<H3>
Assumptions:</H3>
Gemini needs to use the same networking paradigm as Gromit to allow easy
integration.  It is unlikely that Gromit will abandon its current
asynchronous <I>push</I> networking model provided by NetLib-1.
<H3>
Objectives:</H3>

<OL>
<LI>
Repackage the NetLib code into a stand-alone component which is shared
by both Gromit and Gemini.</LI>

<LI>
Move the network processing performed by NetLib onto its own thread(s).</LI>

<BR>This allows other threads to receive data even when the UI thread is
blocked
<LI>
Allow streams to process the pushed data either on the NetLib thread or
to marshal it onto the requesting thread.</LI>

<BR>Streams being processed by non-threadsafe code can marshal the data
to prevent re-engineering  existing code.
<LI>
Create new APIs providing synchronous URL loading which can be used by
newer code (such as java) that runs on different threads...</LI>

<LI>
Incrementally shore up the NetLib code so it is more maintainable and efficient
over time...</LI>
</OL>

<H3>
Milestones:</H3>

<OL TYPE=I>
<LI>
Repackage NetLib as a stand-alone component.  This requires defining
a strict public API which will isolate the underlying implementation from
its consumers.</LI>

<LI>
Deal with threading issues and requirements.</LI>

<LI>
TBD...</LI>
</OL>

<H3>
 Issues:</H3>

<OL>
<LI>
Exposed or shared data structures:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
MWContext.  This structure is only used for progress notifications
and displaying error messages.</LI>

<LI>
URL_Struct.  There is a whole pile 'o stuff in this structure!
I doubt that it is all strictly URL related!</LI>

<LI>
NET_StreamClass</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Threading...</LI>

<H3>
Overview of current NetLib-1 operations</H3>
In NetLib all URLs are loaded <I>asynchronously</I>.  A URL load is
started by calling NET_GetURL(...) which  places the request on the
net_EntryList or on a wait queue if there are too many active connections.
URL loads are driven by repeatedly invoking the NET_ProcessNet(...) function.
NET_ProcessNet(...) walks the net_EntryList and reads any data available
for each ActiveEntry.  This data is ultimately <I>pushed</I> out the
associated stream via calls to the stream's put_block(...) function.

<P><IMG SRC="netlib-1.gif" HEIGHT=452 WIDTH=560>

<P>Netlib also maintains lists of converters and decoders which provide
stream factories for various MIME types.  Whenever a stream is created
these lists are consulted to determine the appropriate type of stream to
create for given data...
