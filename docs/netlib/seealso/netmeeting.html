<H1>Netlib rearchitecture meeting</H1>



<P>July 1 1996:</P>



<P>The meeting began with a discussion of the redesign goals. These were

the goals listed:</P>



<UL>

<LI>Modularize the old code</LI>



<LI>Make sure the new code is thread safe</LI>



<LI>Allow for third party protocol plugins</LI>



<LI>Support the old client api (mostly)</LI>



<LI>Support the newer JAVA URL connection API</LI>

</UL>



<P>&quot;Threads&quot; were also listed as a design goal but the room couldn't

agree to it so it was removed from the list.</P>



<P>The meeting then proceeded into a discussion about why threads were

used in the new design. These were the reasons given:</P>



<UL>

<LI>we want to support a syncronous programming module for protocol plugins

since an asyncronous module is easy to do wrong and any mistake by a plugin

would block the navigator</LI>



<LI>we want to make it easier to program the native protocol modules by

using a syncronous model.</LI>



<LI>ssl becomes much simplier if written syncronously</LI>



<LI>The proxy team pointed out that they wanted threadsafe code but didn't

think they wanted threads due to the expense of thread context switching.

</LI>



<UL>

<LI>we decided to write a threaded test case to compare the performance

of a new threaded design to their proposed asyncronous design</LI>

</UL>

</UL>



<P>We also discussed problems with threads:</P>



<UL>

<LI>Programmer education. Programmers using threads need to know how to

consistantly write thread safe code</LI>



<UL>

<LI>We didn't come to any solution to this other than acknowledge the problem</LI>

</UL>



<LI>debugger/tools many current tools don't handle threads well. We need

to be sure that we have the tools necessary to live in a threaded world</LI>



<UL>

<LI>Lou will be trying to make sure there is a solution to this problem</LI>

</UL>



<LI>threads can be expensive on some platforms</LI>



<UL>

<LI>The new netlib design will allow the reuse of threads to counter thread

creation bottlenecks. User level threads can be used on systems that have

poor context switching performance. (an NSPR issue)</LI>

</UL>



<LI>The proxy team pointed out that they wanted threadsafe code but didn't

think they wanted threads due to the expense of thread context switching.

</LI>



<UL>

<LI>we decided to write a threaded test case to compare the performance

of a new threaded design to their proposed asyncronous design</LI>

</UL>

</UL>



<P>It was pointed out that we could meet most of our goals by using a threadsafe

asyncronous module for the netlib and not use threads. This would trade

the complications of threads for the complications of the asyncronous model,

but it would be isolated to the netlib + ssl. This discussion went on for

quite a while with no clear outcome. Since we were not coming to consensus

we instead moved on to covering the design spec.</P>



<P>Instead of covering the design in this document you should read
<A HREF="thread_netlib.html">the

actual design spec</A></P>



<P>At the end of the design discussion and alot of question and answer

we again revisited the question of whether threads were a good idea for

the new netlib architecture. The group agreed that the design proposed

helped to eliminate many of the dangers of adding threads to otherwise

non-thread safe code. The event queue model for interaction between the

front end and the netlib isolated the most problimatic areas of the codebase

into a controllable queue. By the end of the meeting there little strong

opposition to the design and many people were strongly in favor of it.

Based on that rough consensus the design will proceed, with the condition

that better tools need to be found for all of our supported platforms.</P>
