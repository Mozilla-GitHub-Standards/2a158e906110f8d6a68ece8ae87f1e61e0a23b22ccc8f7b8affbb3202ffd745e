netlib &amp; NSPR (Netscape Portable Runtime)</H1>
Netlib was written using nspr, the Netscape Portable Runtime libraries,
to allow the developers to focus more on network library related issues
rather than cross-platform base functionality problems. For an in depth
explanation of nspr please reference the nspr documentation.

<P>Functions preceded by "PR_" are nspr library functions and replace most
system calls. In some cases these calls simply map to the vanilla system
calls they replace, but, often the system call has been completely rewritten
for optimization and/or portability reasons.

<P>Some nspr routines netlib uses are listed here:
<BR>PR_NetAddrToString() - converts a host entity to a string
<BR>PR_NEWZAP() - allocates memory and zeros it out
<BR>PR_DELETE() - frees memory
<BR>PR_Read() - reads data from a file descriptor
<BR>PR_Write() - writes data to a file descriptor
<BR>PR_Close() - closes a file descriptor
<BR>PR_CurrentThread() - returns the current thread
<BR>PR_SetSocketOption() - sets options on a socket
