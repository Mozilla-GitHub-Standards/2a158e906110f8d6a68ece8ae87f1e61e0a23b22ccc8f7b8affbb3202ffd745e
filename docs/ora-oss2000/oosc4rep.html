<h2>
A Personal Report on the 4th Open Source Conference</h2></center>

<center>July 19-20, 2000&nbsp; Monterey, CA</center>

<p>Reported by <a href="mailto:momoi@netscape.com">Katsuhiko Momoi</a>
<br>Date: 7/24/2000
<p>I attended the 2-day <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon2000/index.html">Open
Source Conference</a> in Monterey primarily to check out Mozilla track
sessions but also to gauge how the Open Source movement itself is going.
The following represents my **personal** takes on some of the things I
observed at the conference.
<p><b>Overall Impressions</b>
<p>The 4th Open Source Conference attracted nearly 2000 people. The biggest
draw seemed to be the Perl/Python crowd. Their session rooms were much
bigger than those allocated for other meetings. A bunch of people attended
from Netscape/Mozilla.org. In addition to presenters, Mitchell Baker, Brendan
Eich (Michael Ang, formerly at NS), Paul Everitt (Zope), Rob Ginda, Scott
Collins, Alec Flett, Frank Hecker, and Ben Goodger, I recognized Dawn Endico,
Gagan Saksena, Eric Pollman, Chris Hoffman, and a few others.
<p>The browser of the choice among the presenters -- not just in the Mozilla
track but also in the Key Note speeches -- was overwhelmingly Mozilla.
Our share at the conference was probably in the above 95% range. People
and exhibitors were mostly running Linux and that was probably the reason.
But there was also a consensus emerging that Mozilla is critically important
to the Open Source Community and a lot of people in this crowd are using
Mozilla. In the network room, I saw several people trying to download nightly
builds on a not so fast connection. About the only people I noticed who
were using IE were sales clerks at O'Reilly booths browsing their book
titles.
<p>Mozilla sessions went very well. The first day's sessions -- six in
all -- were very well-attended. The state of Mozilla and the general architecture
sessions were packed and people sat on the floor to listen. Other sessions
also attracted the room full of attendees. There were 2 sessions on Mozilla
on the 2nd day and the crowd was somewhat smaller but overall well-attended.
<p>Many key people were stressing the importance of Mozilla in the Open
Source movement at this juncture in time. (See below summaries of Key Note
speeches by AndyHertzfeld, intro to StarOffice announcement, and Tim O'Reilly.)
<p><b>Key Note speech by Andy Hertzfeld (7/19/2000): Bringing it All Back
Home: Open Source &amp; the PC Revolution</b>
<ul>
<li>
After tracing the history of personal computer revolution in the last 30
years and Apple's role in it and noting that these early pioneers like
Steve Wozniak had much in common with today's Open Sourcers, he worked
in the following points among others:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Programmers need to pay attention to real users and design software that
helps people.&nbsp; Need for non programmer UI people and programmers to
work together.</li>

<li>
Net-based services rather than desktop computing will be what will define
the near-term future</li>

<li>
He did his presentation using Mozilla and said that Mozilla is critically
important to the Open Source Movement at this juncture. He urged people
to get involved.</li>

<li>
His company's <a href="http://www.eazel.com/about.html">EAZEL</a> Linux
desktop interface is built on GNOME.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b>Sun StarOffice announcement (7/19/2000)</b>
<ul>
<li>
Right after Andy Hertzfeld talk, The MC&nbsp; introduced the next speaker
by saying that</li>

<ul>
<li>
Even though Sun gets a bum rap sometimes, Sun has 40-50 engineers working
on Mozilla currently. He asked rhetorically how many companies can claim
that level of support for Mozilla other than Netscape.</li>

<li>
Marco Boerries, vice president and general manager of webtop and application
software at Sun then made an announcement that StarOffice 6.0 -- greatly
re-written from the 5.x code base and CJK-enabled will <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/project/www/press/sun_release.html">become
open source</a> on Friday, 10/13/2000. They gave away StarOffice 5.2 CD
at the conference. Sun had a big promotion booth giving away CDs and T-shirts
for this occasion. This announcement was met with great applause. The open
source software will be managed by <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffcie.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b>Key Note Speech by Tim O'Reilly</b>: "<b>Open Source Challenges" (7/20/2000)</b>
<ul>
<li>
Tim O'Reilly noted that there is currently healthy support among the Open
Source community for Linux, Perl, and Apache and the like. Stressing that
networked-services rather than desktop computing will be the key for the
future, he noted that Mozilla presents a concern for him because</li>

<ul>
<li>
Support among the Open Source community for Mozilla has not been as great
due to an impression that Netscape engineers spend the majority of their
time optimizing Windows code and not so much on Unix/Linux code. Right
or wrong this is the common perception. He said that the evidence is mounting,
however, that Mozilla will be a crucial part of the Open Source future.</li>

<li>
He cited some companies like Intel using Mozilla in devices. He said that
Zope, Application Server environment, is developing Zope Mozilla for its
web-based content management. Zope is attracting a lot of attention these
days.</li>

<li>
He urged people to recognize how important it is to have a great open source
browser and that Mozilla should get much more support from the Open Source
community.</li>
</ul>

<li>
He then talked about not only sharing desktop top application source codes
but possibly sharing web-based application sources. For example, would
it not be a good idea to share "Map It" software in the open source?</li>

<li>
He mentioned that one of the new emerging paradigms is "chat". For example,
Napster is a form of chat in which the chat centers around the question
of&nbsp; "do you have this piece of music"?</li>
</ul>
<b>Special un-announced presentation by Eric Raymond: "Great Brain Race"
(something like this title)&nbsp; (7/20/2000).</b>
<ul>
<li>
Raymond introduced the notion of&nbsp; "in-corporated"&nbsp; vs " ex-corporated"
workplace of the future. In an older economic model we are used to, we
created an organization like a company to create a walled-community in
which you can exchange goods, services and ideas inexpensively. In the
network-connected world we live in today and tomorrow, this economic calculation
will no longer be true. In fact, the Open Source movement has proven that
"ex-corporated" people -- those who are associated with a project out of
personal interests rather than financial interests -- can be as efficiently
involved (low cost) in a project as the "in-corporated" people.</li>

<li>
His main point was that techno-society of today and tomorrow promises to
provide good earnings to technologically "skilled" people.</li>

<li>
Thus "skilled" people can earn enough to support themselves and will get
involved in things that interest them personally. This is what we have
found out in various Open Source projects. That is, "skilled" people are
not motivated by money alone any more.</li>

<li>
The great puzzle is how we can keep such an "ex-corporated" segment interested
in a project for a long haul.</li>

<li>
Raymond suggests that the key is to offer something "ex-corporated" people
can be passionate about. It is not the monetary reward but the passion
that will drive "skilled" people. Corporations which do not realize this
and can offer only financial rewards will be at a great disadvantage in
the 21st century.</li>

<li>
Raymond mentioned that there are 2 ways to answer the question, "Should
you not be afraid of people plagiarizing your open software code and become
your competitor?"</li>

<ul>
<li>
A timid answer:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Yes, this is possible but the benefits of sharing knowledge and gaining
"ex-corporated" contributions outweigh that risk.</li>
</ul>

<li>
A daring answer:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Plagiarizing is a costly proposition because any software worth stealing
requires great amount of learning time to catch up to the present. While
the plagiarizer is trying to bring out the software which is based on old
technology, your open source engineers have already moved on to the next
future putting further distance between yourselves and the plagiarizer.
Plagiarizers are never able to catch up with the open source movers.</li>

<li>
Thus, from a business point of view, plagiarizing is a losing proposition.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<b>Mozilla sessions: </b>(Brief impressions.)
<p>One thing that struck me is that&nbsp; the people who presented their
talks really knew what they were talking about. These 8 speakers represented
Mozilla projects extremely well. These presentations should become available
at
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/w/sessions.html">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/w/sessions.html</a>
(O'Reilly OSS site)</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/ora-oss2000/">http://www.mozilla.org/docs/ora-oss2000/</a>&nbsp;
(Rob Ginda's OSS Mozilla sessions page)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>State of Mozilla: </b>Mitchell Baker</li>

<ul>
<li>
The room was small but oblong and had bad acoustics but the crowd of 100
people or so attentively listened to Mitchell's address. This was a very
good intro to where Mozilla is today. One could tell the high level of
interest. All of the Wednesday's sessions attracted good crowds but this
one and the next architecture overview had people sitting on the floor.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Inside the Lizard: Mozilla Architecture Overview: </b>Michael Ang and
Brendan Eich</li>

<ul>
<li>
I don't know if these dynamic duo ever did this together but their joint
talk, Michael and Brendan talking and commenting on each other's talk,
was very effective.</li>

<li>
Together they presented a concise yet very informative overview of Mozilla
architecture explaining things like XPCOM, XPIDL, XPCONNECT, NGLayout,
etc.</li>

<li>
This was the session a lot of people were interested in. People raised
a number of questions and this session naturally extended into the lunch
hour. Nobody seemed to mind.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Zope Mozilla Initiative</b>: Paul Everrit</li>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a> is an open source application server.
<a href="http://www.zope.org/Resources/Mozilla/index_html">Zope
Mozilla</a> is a content-management software built on Mozilla. It lets
you manage/revise/update any web-based content as if it is there locally.
Such contents are presented in natural tree views with a variety of means
to organize the content better in the Zope environment. Contents can be
web pages, source codes, etc.</li>

<li>
Zope Mozilla seemed to be attracting a lot of people who normally attend
only scripting language sessions partly because it heavily uses Python.
But Zope as Application Server environment seems to be appealing to a lot
of attendees as well.&nbsp; Zope Mozilla promises to be a showpiece application
built on Mozilla.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Writing a Mozilla application with XUL and JS: ChatZilla</b>. Rob Ginda.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Rob presented a concrete tutorial type talk on how to use XUL to build
an application on Mozilla.</li>

<li>
This was a very good example of how XUL is used on a small scale application
and he also touched on topics like XUL overlays, chrome registry, chrome
url, etc. This would be a good paper to read for anyone wanting to write
a JS based application on XUL.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>How to build a pluggable component:</b> Scott Collins.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Standing in for Mike Shaver, Scott explained Mozilla's component architecture
and how a developer can build a component which can be used/plugged into
by Mozilla. He explained various requirements for building a pluggable
component. A good technical talk.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>An in-depth look at Mozilla Mail/News:</b> Alec Flett &amp; Seth Spitzer</li>

<ul>
<li>
Alec gave an excellent (I'm biased toward Mail/News naturally) overview
of Mail/News architecture explaining in the process that Mail/News is the
largest piece of application built on nearly all of Mozilla's technologies.
His explanation of how RDF is used in Mail/News was very informative.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Open Source Crypto and Mozilla:</b> Frank Hecker</li>

<ul>
<li>
Frank gave an excellent summary of where we are in the Crypto project.
He explained what Crypto services/modules are available and how they are
architecturally built. He explained how the PSM (Personal Security manager)
libraries built on top of NSS (Network Security Services) worked. He also
touched on how Mozilla complies with new the US export rules, some of the
upcoming projects like S/MIME toolkits, etc. Lots of good info here. People
seem to be interested in S/MIME but its implementation is a long-term goal
at this point. A lot of work is to be done by iPlanet. Anyone interested
in Security issues and want to learn what's currently available and what
should be coming in the near future should look at Frank's presentation
when it becomes available online.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Many Faces of Mozilla:</b> Ben Goodger</li>

<ul>
<li>
An excellent intro to skins/themes. Ben covered what one needs to know
to write a skin, i.e. CSS and ability to understand different elements
available in XUL -- though not necessarily the ability to write in XUL.</li>

<li>
Ben later privately talked of the need to create a much more hands-on tutorial
with examples and actual codes connected to them in such a way as to explain
how CSS changes can affect the look and feel of elements.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><br><b>Some ideas/suggestions:</b>
<ul>
<li>
Mozilla had an independent track of 8 sessions in all and a lot of people
were interested. I wish we had a booth and/or other promotions to take
advantage of high level of interests people have shown in Mozilla. Key
noters were solidly behind Mozilla and there were non-Mozilla sessions
which touched on or talked about Mozilla. This was a promo opportunity!</li>

<li>
There probably should have been a freewheeling BOF in the evening to catch
the interested crowd.</li>

<li>
A key note speech by a Mozilla guru -- don't have to be as colorful as
Eric Raymond but an engaging personality would help.</li>

<li>
The acoustics in some of these rooms was pretty bad. There should be a
loudspeaker.</li>

<li>
We should make these presentations available from the Mozilla.org web site
also. --> Now there is a page by Rob Ginda:</li>
