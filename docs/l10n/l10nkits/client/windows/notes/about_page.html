History</H4>
5 May 1998: moved information from the Navigator 4.04 notes, with very
minor edits.
<BR>20 May 1998: edited for public release.

The "About Communicator" page is originally a cross platform HTML resource.
For the Windows client, however, it is converted into stringtable resources
and stored in resdll.dll. Editing these strings is difficult and error-prone.
This technote provides information and tools for handling this more gracefully.

<P>We now recommend doing the About Page as follows:
<OL>
<LI>
Use <A HREF="#getabtbox">GetAbtBox.exe</A> to extract the HTML for the
About Box from your localized Communicator 4.x, and and compare it with
the current file in English.</LI>

<LI>
Edit the HTML file you extracted from Communicator 4.x to make sure that
the HTML file has the same structure as the current US file.</LI>

<LI>
Generate a .rc file using <A HREF="#abpack">AbPack.exe</A>.</LI>

<LI>
Open resdll.dll in your Windows resource editor. Delete the about page
STRINGTABLE resources (begining at 60200 and continuing to about 60240).</LI>

<LI>
Open the .rc file produced by <B>abpack</B>. Copy the STRINGTABLE resources
ONLY (NOT the header or footer information; i.e. only those strings that
are preceded by numeric resource IDs). Paste the STRINGTABLE items into
resdll.dll.</LI>

<LI>
Save your changes to resdll.dll.</LI>

<LI>
Test your work.</LI>

<OL>
<LI>
Use <B>GetAbtBox.exe</B> to extract the new .html file from your localized
resdll.dll and view that page in Communicator. Fix any errors you find.
(You must repeat steps 2 through 6.)</LI>

<LI>
Launch Communicator and choose Help | About Communicator (or type about:
in the location field), and check for the security string that displays
near the RSA icon. If you've done your work correctly, a localized version
of this string will appear in your now localized About Box.</LI>
</OL>

This is a Win32 command line program that will extract the About Page STRINGTABLE
resources and convert them into an HTML file. The syntax is simple:
<UL><TT>GetAbtBox.exe [RESDLL file]</TT></UL>
Redirect the output to a file to generate your HTML file:
<UL><TT>GetAbtBox.exe RESDLL.DLL > about.html</TT></UL>


<P><A NAME="abpack"></A>
<H3>
<A HREF="../tools/abpack.exe">AbPack.exe</A></H3>
This is a Win32 command line program that will convert an HTML file into
a Windows resource script file (.rc). It supports many languages and code
pages, including non-Latin single byte as well as multi byte languages.

<P>Here is the help page for the tool, abpack.exe:
<UL>
<H4>
<TT><U>Netscape Communications Corp. L10n ABPACK Utility</U></TT></H4>
<B><TT>abpack [/c code_page_number] [/l locale_name] file_to_pack.html</TT></B>

<P><TT>The abpack command takes an HTML file and sends to standard output</TT>
<BR><TT>a Win32 resource file that contains a string table formatted for
use</TT>
<BR><TT>as a Communicator or Navigator 4.0.x about box. Currently, the
HTML</TT>
<BR><TT>file should contain exactly 3 '%s' arguments, which the client
will</TT>
<BR><TT>fill-in at run-time</TT>

<P><TT>By default, the program will process the HTML file as Latin 1 text.</TT>
<BR><TT>You may specify code pages with the /c argument, or a locale with
the</TT>
<BR><TT>/l argument. If you specify both, only /l will be used. You need
not</TT>
<BR><TT>have the specified code page installed on your machine, since the
program</TT>
<BR><TT>has the necessary information already</TT>

<P><TT>Legal locals are:</TT>

<P><TT>en,fr,de,da,ja,nl,it,pt,es,sv,ko,zh-tw,zh-cn,no,fi,cs,hu,he,ar,ru,pl,ga</TT>

<P><TT>Supported code pages are:</TT>

<P><TT>932,936,949,950,1250,1251,1252,1255,1256</TT></UL>
To use the tool to generate the resources for Korean, either of the following
calls would work:
<UL><TT>abpack /c 949 Korean.html > Korean.rc</TT>

<P><TT>abpack /l ko Korean.html > Korean.rc</TT></UL>
Or for any European language that uses Latin1 (code page 1252)
<UL><TT>abpack MyHTML.html > MyStringsRC.rc</TT></UL>
