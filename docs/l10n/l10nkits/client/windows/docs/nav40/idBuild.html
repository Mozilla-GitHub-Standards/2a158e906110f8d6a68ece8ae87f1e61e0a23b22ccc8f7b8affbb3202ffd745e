<A NAME="idbuild"></A>Using the idBuild</H3>
A special build of the US English product is provided with this kit, called
the idBuild. This version of the product is designed to help you
locate where specific strings are coming from within the resources.
It does this by prepending to the resource string (putting in front) a
token representing the resource ID. The token will be in the following
form:
<UL>
<LI>
an initial letter, either M,D or S, which stands for Menu, Dialog or Stringtable.
(RCDATA is ignored.)</LI>

<LI>
the resource's numeric id</LI>

<LI>
for Menus and Dialogs, a dash followed by the Item number</LI>


<P>Example: D2298-3 = DIALOG2298Item3</UL>
This knowledge can help expand upon the information provided in the localization
notes by giving you the actual context in which a specific string appears.
It can also help you locate problematic issues, such as stringtable resources
being used in menus, concatenated strings, etc.

<P>NOTE: the idBuild is provided "AS IS" with no guarantees as to functionality,
stability or fitness for any purpose. It may crash, or some features
may not work due to the unexpected way in which the resources have been
modified. Use it at your own risk.

<P><B>To use the idBuild:</B>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>
Install the current version of Communicator (4.03 as of this writing)</LI>

<LI>
Make backup copies of the 8 resource binaries listed in the<A HREF="#localize_these_files">
table above</A>. Store these copies somewhere safe.</LI>

<LI>
Copy the 8 resource binaries provided in the <B><TT><I>kitRoot\</I>products\client\windows\32bit\en\nav40\program\idBuild
</TT></B>directory to the installed version's <B><TT>Program</TT></B> directory
(replacing the originals).</LI>

<LI>
Start the program as usual.</LI>
</UL>
What you will see will be the modified Communicator, with resource IDs
visible next to the actual English strings. In some cases, you might
not be able to see the entire string because of the increased string length.
If absolutely necessary, you can modify the idBuilds binaries using MSDEV
to produce a more usefull version, or you may simply inspect the strings
you can't fully see at runtime.

<P>In the image above, you can see the Communicator's main menu and the
toolbar buttons displayed with attached resource IDs. Note how most of
the menu items begin with "M", telling you they are standard menu resources.
However, a few begin "S", indicating they come from the stringtable resources.
These require special attention when assigning pickletters.

<P>If you see a string in the product itself (not a web page being displayed)
that does not have a resource ID attached, there are 4 possibilities as
it's origin:

<P>1. It is part of a multipart string. For example, the toolbar
buttons are made up of strings with 3 components, each separated by newline
characters (<TT>\n</TT> ). The first part is the status bar message;
this will have the resource ID. The second and third components are
the tooltip (pop-up help message) and the button label itself. These
won't show the resource ID because it is prepended to the first part.

<P>2. The string comes from an RCDATA resource. For example, the
Help menu contains a number of entries that come from CONFIG_PREFS.
These are not touched by the idBuild generation process.

<P>3. The string comes from an external source. For example, the
idBuild doesn't contain the MFC resources, so any strings coming from MFC42.dll
will be in there original form.

<P>4. The string is hard-coded in the Netscape binary. There are
still several strings that have not been resourced (for example, the Java
Console is entirely hard-coded). You will not be able to localize
these for this version.
