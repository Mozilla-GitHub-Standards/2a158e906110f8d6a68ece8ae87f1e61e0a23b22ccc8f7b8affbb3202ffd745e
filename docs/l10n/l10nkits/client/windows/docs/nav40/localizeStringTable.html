<A NAME="localize_stringtable"></A>Localizing String Tables</H3>
STRINGTABLE resources are the most sensitive, potentially problematic resource
type you will be working with. Therefore, you must pay close attention
to the instructions provided in the localization notes.
<H4>
<A NAME="locnote_stringtable"></A>Localization Notes</H4>
String table resources are identified by the word STRINGTABLE, followed
by the numeric resource ID generated from the project's header files.
For example, in the file brpref32.dll, STRINGTABLE109 contains the label
and explanatory text for the Languages pane of the preference dialog.
Localization notes for string table resources are provided in the comments
field for each resource contained in the associated .DOG file. Please pay
special attention to these notes and to the TRANSLATE field. In general,
be aware of the following:
<UL>
<LI>
Many strings contain C++ print format strings, such as %s, %ld, %lu, etc.
Do not modify these while translating the rest of the string.</LI>

<LI>
Many strings contain new line characters: \n. In general, you should
try leave these as you find them. In some cases, the new line is
used to delimit a matched set of strings used to build a button label,
a ToolTip and a status bar message all relating to single control. In these
cases, you must preserve the new line characters.</LI>

<BR>Many strings actually show up as part of an HTML or Javascript document
or dialog. Be careful not to break format tags, like &lt;TITLE>,
&lt;FONT>, etc. by translating these.</UL>
