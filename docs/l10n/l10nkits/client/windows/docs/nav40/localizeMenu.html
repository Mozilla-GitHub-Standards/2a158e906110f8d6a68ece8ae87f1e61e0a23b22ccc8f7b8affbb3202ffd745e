Menu resources can also be localized using ToolCool or your preferred localization
tools. Menu translation is usually not as tricky as localizing string tables;
however, you should take care to assign unique pickletters to menu choices.
This process can be made difficult by the fact that some strings that appear
in menus at runtime actually come from string tables. The special
ID Build provided in this kit can help you find these.

Menu resources are identified first by the word MENU, then by a resource
number, then by a sequential Item number. For example, in resdll.dll, MENU2ITEM0
contains the word "&amp;File". This resource is the first item in menu
structure structure #2 (the File menu). The ampersand character (&amp;)
denotes the pickletter is the letter "F". Localization notes for
individual MENU resource items are provided in the comments field for that
item in the localization databases. Not all MENU resource items need to
be translated so again, please pay special attention to these notes and
to the TRANSLATE field!
