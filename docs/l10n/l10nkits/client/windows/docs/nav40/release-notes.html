These are the current release notes for the localization kit for
Communicator and Navigator for 32 bit Windows. Please ignore any

<H3>
What's New in this Kit</H3>
This kit is the first update to the publicly available localization kits being
distributed under Netscape's universal localization program. The first kit 
was based on Communicator version 4.03; this kit is based on version 4.05. 
For information on the changes and improvements made to Communicator and Navigator
4.05, please read the product release notes 
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/4.0/relnotes/windows-4.0.html">here:</A>
<P>
(http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/4.0/relnotes/windows-4.0.html)
<P>
From the standpoint of localization, there are no major new components to translate,
although a fair number of strings and other User Interface elements have changed
since 4.03. (Our internal word counts showed some 800 words changed between 4.03 and
4.04, and some 3,000 words changed between 4.04 and 4.05). If you are localizing 
Communicator for the first time, these changes will be of no consequence to you. 
If, however, you have previously localized version 4.03 and wish to preserve your 
earlier work, please read the next two sections carefully.

<A NAME="known_issues"></A>
<H3>
Known Issues</H3>

As noted above, a large number of user visible strings changed between versions 
4.04 and 4.05. These changes are largely due to the reorganizing of the so-called
"Security Advisor" dialogs. These dialogs are cross-platform string resources
derived from HTML pages; they are visible when the user chooses Communicator | 
Security Info from the main menus, or presses any of the Security icons or buttons
in the product. They range in resource ID from STRINGTABLE30000 to STRINGTABLE32597.
The reorganization of these resources included changing some of the original
text, adding new strings, deleting old strings and changing the resource IDs of 
existing strings. In some cases, both the text and the ID changed simultaneously. 
These changes will make leveraging (automatically re-using) earlier translation 
work difficult. These changes were made for the following reasons:

<UL>
	<LI>Previously, if a group of strings required contiguous ID numbers, there was no way 
	to add a string to the group without moving other strings.</LI> 
	
	<LI>The old Security build system did not know how to build the security strings in 
	ALLXPSTR.H without assigning consecutive ID numbers at build time
	(this has now been addressed). </LI>

	<LI>A table of resource names had to be moved down in "ID Space" so that the Security 
	strings would not run out of IDs. </LI>
</UL>

If you plan on leveraging a previous translation into 4.05, using DogLev or another 
resource leveraging tool that depends on matching resource IDs, you will need to deal
with these changes. The section below discusses the approach we used at Netscape to 
address this issue.

<HR SIZE=3>

<A NAME="leveraging"></A>
<H3>
Leveraging from Previous Versions</H3>

&quot;Leveraging&quot; is the term we use to describe the process of
reusing translations from one version to the next. This avoids the 
cost and effort of retranslating items for which we already have usable
translations.
<P>
DogLev is the Netscape Leveraging tool for Windows resources. It is 
provided as part of this localization kit to help you preserve your
translation investment. You are not required to use this tool, but
if you choose to use it, please consult the 
<A HREF="../dogTool/dogToolUG.html">Netscape Translation Tools Users Guide</A>
for more information DogLev and ToolCool (the resource editing 
component of the translation tool set).
<H4>
Leveraging the 4.03 or 4.04 Security Advisor Strings</H4>
As mentioned above, you will need to deal with the changed resources 
in the Security Advisor strings. 
<P>
Following this section, there is a link to a .ZIP file containing several files, 
including a Windows resource script (.rc) file. This file contains the new 
STRINGTABLE resources from 4.05. Strings which have changed from 4.04 
are identified using standard C comments: 

<BR>
<FONT COLOR=green>
// Previously <I>n</I>
</FONT>
<BR>
where <I>n</I> is equal to the resource's ID value in version 4.04.
<P>

Also included in this .ZIP file is a perl script, a modified version of 
the 4.04 resdll.dll file and a couple of supporting files. You can use 
these to create a leveragable version of your localized 4.04 or 4.03 product
in the following way:

<P>
<OL>
	<LI>Download the attached .ZIP file and unzip the contents.</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>Make sure that allxpstr_win32.txt is in the current directory.</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>In Developer Studio or similar resource editor, create a new
	resource script file, and copy all of the string tables from your
	localized resdll.dll into the empty resource script.</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>Save the new resource script (we'll assume you call it old_strs.rc).</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>Run the Perl script, pulling your old strings from standard input,
	and redirecting the output into a new resource script file
	(we'll use "new_strs.rc"):
	<P>
		<UL>
		<B><TT>perl convert_404_st.pl < old_strs.rc > new_strs.rc</B></TT>
	    </UL>
	<P>
	If all goes well, your new string file should open up as a resource
	script in Developer Studio.  Fix any errors found by the compiler
	(in our tests, we had no such problems, although the script could 
	potentially generate an empty STRINGTABLE, which Developer Studio
	doesn't like).</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>Make a copy of your localized 4.04 resdll.dll, and delete the 
	entire string table from the copy.</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>Copy the "shifted" strings from your new_strs.rc file into the 
	copy of your localized DLL, and save the changes.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
The new "shifted" localized DLL can now be used to leverage with the
old "shifted" US file, and will result in better results when leveraged
against 4.05. A copy of the shifted 4.04 US resdll.dll is contained in the
.ZIP file.
<P>
The above steps will also work with 4.03, however, you may need to adjust a 
small number of strings after processing. These will most likely be identified
as ID ONLY matches in ToolCool's REASON field.
<P>
NOTE: You may want to adjust the .rc file's language settings to account 
for your language's requirements.

<P>
If you try to leverage without addressing the changed resource IDs first, 
you will have the cross platform Security Advisor strings scattered through the
product at random IDs. This will cause the program to malfunction or even crash.
<P>
The alternative to the steps above is to releverage from 4.04, but first
remove the cross platform (XP) strings from the string table. This will
treat all the XP strings as new (NO MATCH) and they will be in English. You
can then retranslate them.  
<P>
Hint: if you used the .dbf files to keep your translations up to date you can 
use ToolCool to "Import from Glossary". This might save you some work. Here's 
how to do this:
<OL>
	<LI>Open your resdll.dbf in ToolCool.</LI>
	<LI>Choose Export | Text and save as resdll.txt.</LI>
	<LI>Do the leveraging described above.</LI>
	<LI>Open the newXL resdll.dbf</LI>
	<LI>Choose "Import from Glossary" and select resdll.txt you created in step
     2.</LI>
	<LI>This will look up translations from the resdll.txt and try to match
     them to resdll.dbf.</LI>
	<LI>When that is done, choose Save and update RESDLL.DLL.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
(This may not be perfect but it might save you some retranslation work).
