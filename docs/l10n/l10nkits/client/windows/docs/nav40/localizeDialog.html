Dialog resources can also be localized using ToolCool or your preferred
localization tools. Dialog translation is usually not as tricky as localizing
string tables; however, you should take care to assign unique pickletters
to dialog controls. This process can be made difficult by the fact
that some strings that appear in menus and dialogs at runtime actually
come from string tables. The special ID Build provided in this kit
can help you find these. Once a DIALOG resource has been translated, the
dialog may need to be resized using a visual resource editor, such as MSDEV
(Microsoft(R) Visual C++ 4.0 or greater) or Borland(R) Resource Workshop.

<A NAME="locnote_menus"></A>Localization Notes</H4>
Dialog resources are identified first by the word DIALOG , then by a resource
number, then by a sequential Item number. For example, in nsmailui.dll,
DIALOG129Item0 contains the word "Password". This resource is the first
item (the dialog title) in DIALOG129. Localization notes for individual
DIALOG resource items are provided in the comments field for that item
in the localization databases. Not all DIALOG resource items need to be
translated so again, please pay special attention to these notes and to
the TRANSLATE field!

<P><B>A special note on Dialog fonts</B>:
<BR>The second item in each dialog definition (e.g. DIALOGnnnITEM1) is
the font information for that dialog. If you find it necessary to
change the font name or size, be aware of the following fact: the font
size is represented in the translation database by the ASCII character
corresponding to that size. In the US product the default font size
is 9, which appears as a Horizontal Tab (Font size = 9 = ASCII character
9 = tab). In the database, this will appear as an unprintable character,
such as a black box. There are two concerns here: first, if you change
the font name, be careful not to accidentally delete the tab character.
Second, if you decide to change the font size, you can do so by substituting
the appropriate ASCII character which matches the new size you want.
For example, to change the font size to 10, replace the tab with a Line
Feed character (ASCII 10). This is rather confusing, so it is probably
best to avoid changing the fonts if possible.
