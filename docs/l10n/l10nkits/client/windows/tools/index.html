<P>This page lists some of the tools we've been using to make our binary
localization model easier. If you know of other tools we should list here,
let me know.

<P>Win32 console programs are designed to be run from the command shell.
These will probably work best on Windows NT.

<P>Note: these tools are distributed "AS IS", with no warranties, expressed
or implied that they are suitable for any purpose. Use them at your own
risk.

<B><A HREF="GetAbtBox.exe">GetAbtBox.exe</A></B>:
a utility for extracting the "About Communicator" box that gets put up
by the client. Point it at resdll.dll, and redirect the output to
some place useful.</LI>
<P>

<B><A HREF="abpack.exe">abpack.exe</A></B>:
a utility for taking an HTML file that you want to use for the about box
in the Netscape client, and munging it into something that can be imported
into resdll.dll. The output by default is a Win32 .RC file, but the
tool can also generate output suitable for importing into ToolCool.</UL>
