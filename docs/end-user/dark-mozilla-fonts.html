      <p class="justify">There are far better pages scattered around out
there, but this is the page I wish I'd found to begin with; a linux newbie
guide based on a RedHat6 workstation install. I've used Linux at home only
since '99 but use UNIX at work. LL: This is for You.</p>
                                               
      <p class="justify">A Choice of Operative System is traditionally based 
    on what we'll use a machine for, but borders between OS aspects of usability 
    are fading. Consider Linux if security, uptime, server- and multi-user 
 abilities,  automation, tunability or low costs matter.</p>
                                               
      <p class="justify">If you're the only user on your PC and mainly use 
    it for office tasks, games and occasional mail and web browsing - stick 
  with Windows, it's excellent for that use. Then again.. if you can't afford 
  an Office suite, Linux offer a lot. But if you're a designer and used to 
 Mac's.. hmm.. well. </p>
                                               
      <p class="justify">Some call Linux a "do it yourself" OS - there's
some truth to that. You may have to undergo a steep learning curve to unlock
 it's treasures. But the hype is hot, the kids screaming for drivers.. I
decided  to take a harder look. And I'm impressed. Linux is getting ready
for the desktop. </p>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When you know your hardware is OK, partitioning
    disk(s) is next "obstacle". Give that some thought - it can prove invaluable
    when you later upgrade your PC. The RedHat Installation Guide is good
but    there are some points I think could have been made clearer: </font></p>
           
<ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The installation does 
not check for disk    space. If you choose more rpm packages than there's 
room for, the install    simply hangs. If you install a lot of rpm's, you 
need more space in /usr   than the 500 Mb's the Guide mention. I stuffed 700
Mb in /usr in no time.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Installation Guide 
is correct about    not needing much space for /tmp on a single user system. 
I set up 100 MB   but 50 would have been more than enough. NOTE: Let the system
administer  what  happens in /tmp: Files "older than..." are eventually deleted.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Rule of the thumb says 
the size of your    swapdisk(s) should equal your RAM, and not be smaller 
than 16MB. Earlier   versions of Linux didn't accept swap disks bigger than 
128MB and making several  swapdisks was a solution. Current Linux'es accept 
swapdisk over one gig. Note: New Linux kernels version 2.4.* should be given 
a swap-disk TWICE the amount of your physical RAM.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The day may come when 
you want to compile    a newer kernel, or at least need a kernel configuration 
file. The kernel   IS Linux and you'll want space for the kernel source files. 
These happily   chomp around 50 MB, placed in /usr/src/linux-nn.nn.. Don't 
get so cramped   you can't install them.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For future flexibility: 
Do make /home  a separate partition.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Read the Installation 
Guide about partitioning    with this in mind. Jot down your own partition 
layout before you do the  actual  partitioning. When it's partition time in

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Linux indicate partition names different
than MS operative systems. A Linux partition name also tells what kind of
disk we're dealing with, and which partition of that disk it is. There are
different types of disks. Single user systems normally use (E)IDE and/or
SCSI disks. </font></p>

        SCSI disks would be sda1, sda2, sdb1 etc. <br>
        The quickest IDE disks are as fast as SCSI disks. SCSI's benefit
is  "unlimited"   number of HD's. Most  mainboards only have controllers
for up to 4 IDE disks,   one of these normally  used for a CD-ROM. </font></p>

    on workstations. Typically used on servers demanding 100% uptime, mirrored
    disks, hot swapping etc. and they require expensive RAID disk-controller
   cards. Linux, however, also support "soft RAID", providing the mirroring
  abilities from the RAID system but used on "normal" disks. Private users
 aren't very likely to need this either. </font></p>

        In addition, a <u>user</u> called root is a basic concept in unix.
 A  home   directory for the user root will automatically be created under
 / and named   /root <br>

 make   a separate <u>partition</u> called /root </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">User root is the superuser with "a license

  you will be prompted for a password: It's the root password you then set. 
  <br>
        The root account is NOT the account you use on a daily basis. Your
 first  vital task  as root, after install, is to create a private account
 for yourself.  After  you've created your account, you from then on log
in  as your private  user  and only change to user root to do serious system
work, installations  etc.  (and then you swiftly log out from root again).
Using root as your normal  login would sooner or later prove disastrous.
One slip of the finger can erase vital files and mess your system up for
good. The user "root" is a key security concept on unix based systems.</font><br>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Linux by default create common users home-directories
    as sub directories under /home <br>
        What you assign as the new users login-name will become the name
of      his/her home directory. <br>
        Each user is set up to belong to a certain group or groups. These 
group    associations give the user certain rights and restrictions. A set 
of default    groups and users are predefined. If a new user is to be a common 
user on   the machine, assign this user to the group "users". <br>
        Someone you want to only be able to ftp into the machine, you would 
 assign   to the group "ftp" to restrict their access to ftp only. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The user identification is called <b>UID</b>
        . The group identification is called <b>GID</b>. Internally, Linux
 use   numbers  to say something about users or groups: root always has UID
 0. The  first common user root creates on the system will be assigned UID
 500, the  next one UID 501 and so forth. There is no reason to change that
 on a fresh  install UNLESS you're already in a permanent network and a mailserver
 for  instance know users by different UID's. If that is the case, you should
 probably  conform  to UID's already in use, and you will find them on the
 existing system in  a file called /etc/passwd  (if you don't find it
 consult the network  administrator.) </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For each new user you create, a set of default
    initialization files will be copied to that users home directory. The
user    can later modify these to her own liking. These files often start
with a dot when  found in a home directory, and can later be modified by
the user.  The basis for them  can only be changed by root, and are located
in /etc and various sub directories  there, like /etc/skel.</font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Usernames should be unique, alphanumeric, 
  and no longer than 11 characters. Longer usernames are possible but NOT 
practical.  They must not contain special characters, like spaces. Usernames 
longer than 11 characters are possible but NOT practical! Keep them short. 
 If you want a mail address with a full name, that is arranged via mail aliases 
and not the  system username.<br>
      Don't use space's in passwords either. A good password is "impossible"
  to guess. It shouldn't be something you read elsewhere.  Instead, compose
  it from of a mix of upper- and lowercase letters and numbers. This would
 be a good password, if it hadn't been for the fact that you just read it
here: ^D#s*iPL8 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Workstation users will typically want a GUI
    (Graphical User Interface). For that, you need X configured. Three different
    configurators are installed: </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">/usr/X11R6/bin/<b>XF86Setup</b><br>
        /usr/X11R6/bin/<b>xf86config</b><br>
        /usr/X11R6/share/<b>Xconfigurator</b></font></p>
           
<ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">XF86Setup: the one you 
maybe used when    you installed: An X app, low resolution, with setup options 
for mouse, language,   monitor and all that is X related. The most "advanced" 
of the setup apps.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">xf86config: basically 
the same as above    but a simpler VGA presentation of it.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Xconfigurator: Deals 
with setup of graphic    card and monitor only. Handy when you don't want 
to mess with the other  settings.  Can be started with --expert parameter 
if you need to modify for  instance  memory settings manually (without probing).</font></li>
           
</ul>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica">These all write to the same textfile:
XF86Config.     The names may confuse you - they're much alike: Remember
that UNIX/Linux    differ between uppercase and lowercase letters. All lowercase
<b>xf86config</b>        is a program that can write to a textfile, and the
textfile X read  it's   configuration  from is <b>XF86Config</b> - capital
X,F and C.</font>        
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During install you are given an option to
    start X by default. I advice you don't select that till all your setup
 is   guaranteed correct. Most fiddle around for a week before settling down
 with   X, tuning resolution and fonts. During that you're "safer" if you've
 made   a habit of logging in from commandline (at runlevel 3) instead of
from an   X-enabled login-manager (at runlevel 5). More about runlevels later
- just   remember X can get grumpy if it disagrees with your typos. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>startx</b> from commandline starts an
X session. <br>
        The startx command is a front-end to something called xinit. Xinit
 reads    the script .xinitrc - a prototype script provided with the installation,
   with heaps of settings you'll never use. When you get smarter you can
edit    that and for instance remove redundant lines, which will cause slightly
 less  text fly by as you start X. Just never experiment without having a
backup  of some sort. To force X to start with another colordepth than your
default,  here's a sample to start with 32 bits per pixel (your card must
support it):  <b> startx -- -bpp 32</b></font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Mouse:</b><br>
        If you have a two-button mouse, select "emulate three buttons". This
  makes   it act in special ways when you click both buttons. In Unix, that
  third button  is used to paste with, drag scrollbar buttons and more. You'll
  want this!  To set up a wheel mouse correct, add the line "ZAxisMapping
4  5" as the last  line under "section pointer" in XF86Config, or select
"5 button mouse" in  the setup menu. It doesn't actually have 5 buttons,
but it does in effect  have three, and events the wheel generate (scroll
up/down) add for two more  types of behavior.  Most applications understand
the wheel. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Virtual Resolution</b><br>
        With enough memory on your graphics card, you can set up a virtual
 desktop    larger than the actual display size. You can have a display resolution
 at   1024x768 on a 15" and a *virtual resolution* of 1280x1024. The effect
 of  this is NOT the same as the "desktop" options (1,2,3,4 etc.) where you
 can  "jump" between desktops via a pager (or sensitive screen-edges). Virtual
  desktops are valid for the <b>current desktop</b> and let you "slide" or
 "pan" the visible area, so when your cursor hits the edge of the screen
it  will move slightly right/left etc. and display the rest of the virtual
resolution   you set it up for. Personally I detest that feature - makes
me sea-sick.  </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Desktop Environments and Window Managers</b><br>
        X is the fundament for any GUI [Graphical User Environment] on Linux
  for   now. KDE, GNOME, or any other of those more or less good looking
desktop    environments and also the window managers utilize X. RH6 comes
with KDE/KDM,    GNOME/Enlightenment, fvwm, fvwm2 and AnotherLevel. In RH6
the default GUI    is GNOME. It's worth while to also test out KDE. You find
RPM packed upgrades    of GNOME and KDE at the RedHat site and I strongly
recommend to install  these.   <br>
        X also has it's own minimalistic GUI: If no desktop environment is
 specified,    a simple X session with one instance of the Xterm terminal
window will start.   </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A <b>desktop environment</b> is a complete
    GUI solution, providing toolbars, icons, applets, applications, and abilities
    like drag/drop. A <b>window manager</b> is just an application, working
  in  cooperation with the desktop environment and specializing in "makeup
 and behavior". It deals with wallpapers, frames, handles, borders and let
 you choose how you want windowing events to perform: whether a window shall
 rise to top when the mouse is over it, be transparent while moved etc. A
desktop environment can run with one of several different window managers.
KDE is a desktop manager and comes with its own window manager called KDM,
but you aren't obliged to run KDM under KDE. <br>
        Gnome doesn't have a window manager of it's own and the RH6 version 
 comes   bundled with a setup that gives you the choice of several window-managers.
    I fell flat in love with Enlightenment :) </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Since a desktop manager provide programs,
    it has to conform to some suitable programming language. <b>GNOME is
based     on <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> </b> , an Open Source
GUI toolkit    primarily developed for use with the X Window System. <br>
      <b>KDE is based on <a href="http://www.troll.no/">QT</a>  </b>
 - a  GPL   licenced cross platform GUI toolkit by a norwegian company called 
Troll  Tech.  QT2.0 got the 1999 LinuxWorld Editor's Choice Award for Best 
Programming/Library    Tools. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you want to compile programs made for
GNOME or KDE on your own, you need these libraries installed. Both are found
on the RH6 disk, but newer versions exist. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In addition to applications the desktop environments
    provide there's a plethora of "pure" X applications and widgets included.
    As a new user I kept wondering about why there were so damn many filemanagers,
    editors and process viewers added - it took me days to get oriented in
 menus...even   learn the names. A wilderness . Then again - there's something
 for every  taste and CPU so.. why not. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Switchdesk:</b><br>
        Let you select between KDE, GNOME and AnotherLevel as the desktop 
environment    to start the next time you run startx.  Start it by writing 
"switchdesk"    from a terminal window. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>"Runability":</b><br>
        &gt;Programs written for X run under any Desktop environment. In
addition     a Desktop environment can use extra libraries that X don't know
too much    about. Applications written for KDE *may* not run under GNOME
and vice versa.   Most do, however. If you're on KDE and start a GNOME application,
just avoid   using it's docking features or the GNOME toolbar will start
and mess up your  display. (it's gone again next time you start x though.)
</font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Toggle Resolution</b>: <br>
        Monitor resolution toggles on the fly with "ctrl alt +" and "ctrl 
alt   -"  IF you set up more than one resolution when you configured X. You 
can   also  define your own F-keys for resolutions. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>For the curious:</b><br>
        To save the text that flicker past your screen as you startx, redirect
   the  standard output- and error messages to a file. This syntax is valid
  for the  shell called bash: <br>
        startx &gt; startx.txt 2&gt;&amp;1 </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you don't want to see it at all you can
    dump the output to /dev/null (think of it as a trashbin with no recovery)

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In a virtual terminal window you can run
commands and start programs. A common icon for virtual terminals is the "X"

        What happens when you start a terminal window is comparable to what 
 happens   when you choose "run DOS in a window", but you can only start one
 shell called  command.com this way in Windows, and the terminal emulator 
  will always  look and behave the same way (apart from fonts). Linux has
plenty  of terminal  types AND shell-options, highly adaptable. <b>Xterm</b>
  is "the  mother of  all virtual terminals". It's unlikely that you will
need all it's  features.  I use <b>rxvt</b> instead - a smaller and quicker

        xfsft</a>  - a truetype fontserver - is made a part of xfs, the x

library and ghostscript    rpm from the install CD. To install a rpm package 
you must be user root.   Logged in as a common user: just write su in a terminal 
window, provide root's  password, write gnorpm &amp; and a graphical rpm administration
program starts.  Mount the CD-rom, click "add", find freetype and ghostscript
and install.  So far, so good. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Quirk 1:</b> Font-names must be in lowercase
    and contain no spaces. If you already have tt-fonts on a partition containing
    Windows, a quick way to copy them all in lowercase is to mount the partition
    as a DOS filesystem instead of fat32. This way they'll all seem to be
lowercase    without spaces, whatever they might look like on a fat32 partition.
Afterwards    you can change partition type back to whatever is relevant.
The file that    needs modyfying if you want to do this is /etc/fstab. Unmount
first - change    filesystem - remount and the files will be 8.3 type DOS
files se seen from    Linux. If you don't feel comfortable with editing this
file by hand, use   linuxconf to unmount. change filesystem, and remount.
That way you don't  risk typos. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Quirk 2:</b> Fonts can be more or less
    broken, and not so "true" to their type as the name indicate. Below is
 a  reference to a little program you shall run: "ttmkfdir". We testrun this
  first and watch the output, to see if some fonts look completely crappy.
 You'll know when that happens IF it happens - it looks pretty wild. Delete
 offending fonts and try again. If you think it ALL looks wild, it's probably
 OK. If unsure, compare with an existing file called fonts.dir in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc 
    </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Here the suggested approach to get TT fonts
    up and running. Commands are done as user root. What you write is annotated
    in bold fonts. Open a console window, <b>su root</b>, then: </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts <br>
        ls -la</b><br>
        If a directory called TrueType is not there - make it with <br>
      <b>mkdir TrueType</b><br>
        then <br>
      <b>cd TrueType</b><br>
        Now copy your truetype fonts to the new directory <br>
      <b>cp /dir/with/ttfonts/*.* .</b><br>
        (the last dot is a pointer to "current directory" - here applied
as  your   target directory) <br>
        When that is done (still in the TrueType directory) we do the mentioned 
   testrun of ttmkfdir, to see that the font descriptions we store afterwards 
   is set up ok in the long unix-wise manner. If one or more fonts seem to 
 vary  wildly from the other descriptions there's something crappy with the 
 internal  font description of that font. Delete it (rm somefont.ttf) and 
try again - till the output seems reasonable uniform. The line-lengths can 
vary but should contain the same "elements". <br>
      <b>ttmkfdir</b><br>
        If the output seem to follow the same type of pattern for all fonts 
 we  proceed:  <br>
      <b>ttmkfdir -o fonts.scale</b><br>
        Now for the smart part: For some reason ttmkfdir sort the font entries
   in  reverse.  This cause problems with character cell truetype fonts when
   the  font also contain proportional characters: TT charcell fonts  are
not   well  handled under X. If you ONLY use the command above when creating
fonts.scale,    you won't run in to problems: The character  cell letters
won't be included    for the common MS webfonts. But often we want to include
decorative fonts    in fonts.scale. These often lack many characters, and
ttmkfdir  by default    only tolerate 5 missing characters in a font. However,
we can tell it to   be more tolerant with the parameter -m nnn where nnn
 is the number of missing    characters we want to tolerate in a font. A
"ttmkfdir -m 100 -o fonts.scale"    will make a much larger file, however,
and since it sorts them in reverse,    the character cell fonts will now
be listed before the proportional variants    within the same font.  This
plainly sux, because applications can "jump  to  conclusions" and grab the
first and best occurance of a requested font  - and if that is a TT charcell
font it will look like there's heaps of white   space on both sides of it.
Bad bad bad. <br>
        So as a good rule - before we proceed now - we <b>reverse</b> the 
content    of the file fonts.scale to put it right again, like this: <br>
      <b>tac fonts.scale &gt; fonts.dir</b><br>
        If you write "head fonts.dir" now you will see the first font begins
  with   an "a" (most likely).  <br>
        Since the first entry in a fonts.dir and fonts.scale file should
be  a  number  listing how many entries there are in the files, we must 
do a  little  manual  editing to perfect it. <br>
        Open fonts.dir in an editor <br>
        Go to the bottom of the file <br>
        Cut out the number there <br>
        Go to top of the file and paste the number in there, so it is alone 
 on  the  first line. <br>
        Make sure the file ends with a linefeed. Then SAVE it and exit the
 editor.    <br>
        NOW we have an OK fonts.dir file! But we still have the old topsy 
turvy    fonts.scale file.  Since these two files in our case are meant to 
be identical    anyway, we now overwrite the original fonts.scale file we 
made: <br>
      <b>cat fonts.dir &gt; fonts.scale</b><br>
        We are ready to rehash xfs, which happens automatically whenever
a  fontpath    is added or removed with the utility "chkfontpath". <br>
      <b>/usr/sbin/chkfontpath --add /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType</b></font></p>

 to be   very limited  - often the case with decorative fonts. If you make
 a new fonts.scale  file  this way, remember to "reverse" it, move the number-entry

sizes differently. Netscape under MSWindows display a larger font at "12

2 points. What this means in practical life  is that TT fonts smaller than
9 points aren't readable under Linux. But many sites use them, since they
appear larger on MSWindows. </font></p>

 discovered    they are lacking in RH6. And that's  why helvetica fonts on
 typical unix   sites on web look way bad and scale as smooth as...a brick.
  If you recognize   the problem: Do this to check whether there at all are
 aliases for helvetica:    <br>
      <b>grep elve /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/fonts.alias <br>
        grep elve /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/fonts.alias</b><br>
        If it isn't already aliased: Check that you have it installed: <br>
      <b>grep elve /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/fonts.dir <br>
        grep elve /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/fonts.dir</b><br>
        If you didn't have aliases, but did get filenames listed after the
 last   two commands (lines mentioning helvetica outside filenames) - you
 have it  aboard, all is well and we will proceed: <br>
        Use the contents from these pages <b><a href="http://home.online.no/%7Erut-aane/75dpi.txt">75dpi</a>

        Then start by taking a copy for safekeeping of the original fonts.alias 
   files you already have in the mentioned directories. <br>
        Then - as root: <br>
        -fire up your favourite editor <br>
        -open the fonts.alias files in the above directories <br>
        -paste the content into the corresponding files AFTER what is there

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Roman Sulzhyk</b> [roman@starmedia.net]
    sent me a nice mail including a python script he wrote to ease the creation
     of a fonts.alias file. And after I had edited this page to include the
  script,  he read the page here once more and modified the  script to take
  into account  the error with fontsizes rendering smaller under Linux than
  under Windows.  I am still not sure whether this is a bug in FreeType or
  whether MS have  bumped up the sizes on Windows, but as long as we can
compensate   for it, it doesn't matter too much. So thank you Roman,  and
thanks again   :) It works  like a dream. <br>
        I added names for common MS webfonts to it earlyer, so this is already
   version  0.3 ;) <br>
        It is easy to add other fonts it should map, follow the same syntax.
  Roman   Sulzhyk's script is perfect for making an initial  fonts.scale
file   for tt-fonts.  You should not, however, use it for native X-fonts,
due to   the TT specific  compensation it does. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To use the script you need <a href="http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/redhat/6.2/i386/python-1.5.2-13.i386.html">
        python</a>  installed.  <br>
        (There are perl scripts that do the same thing, but noone ever mailed 
  me  one.) <br>
      <b>NOW:</b><br>
        - Save <a href="http://home.online.no/%7Erut-aane/mkfontalias.py">mkfontalias.py</a>  and then.. <br>
      <b>su root</b><br>
        - copy the file to a directory in your path. (echo $PATH). I copied 
 it  to  /usr/local/bin <br>
      <b>cp mkfontalias.py /usr/local/bin</b><br>
        - change filemode on it so it becomes runnable: <br>
      <b>chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/mkfontalias.py</b><br>
        - cd to your TT font-dir, e.g. <br>
      <b>cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType</b><br>
        - run the script by simply writing: <br>
      <b>mkfontalias.py</b></font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Depending on how you ran ttmkfdir the first
    time, you can now end up with a pretty large file: mkfontalias.py use
 the   existing fonts.dir file as basis for creating a fonts.alias. If you
 ran ttmkfdir  with for instance the "-m 100" option mentioned earlyer, 
you  now got a lot  of aliases for character sets you will never use, and
thus  don't need aliases  for. <br>
        So what we do now do is filter the file down to something that suits
  our   language and won't torture X too much.  In my case iso8859-1 do nicely,
  so  I now wrote: <br>
      <b>grep 'iso8859-1"' fonts.alias &gt; newfonts.alias <br>
        cat newfonts.alias &gt; fonts.alias</b><br>
        This trimmed fonts.alias down to contain only the iso8859-1 entries.
  </font></p>
           
<ul>
        <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><small>If you want both iso8859-1 AND
 another    set - say iso8859-3 - we do this a little different by filtering
  in two   steps and *appending* the output (with &gt;&gt;) from the last
grep to the   newfile. This of course assumes you have iso8859-3 fonts there
in the first   place:   <br>
         grep 'iso8859-1"' fonts.alias &gt; newfonts.alias <br>
         grep 'iso8859-3"' fonts.alias &gt;&gt; newfonts.alias <br>
         cat newfonts.alias &gt; fonts.alias </small></font>      
</ul>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So far so good. We now have a valid fonts.alias
    file. <br>
        Now remember the fontsize issue: A 12 point font under MSWindows
will   look  approximately like a 10 point font under Linux.  This isn't
a real  problem  untill the fonts get very small. You *may* want to edit
the fonts.alias    file  to become 100% consistant,  and alias ALL fonts
with an offset of  2  points.  But this isn't really required, and personally
i find the bigger    fonts become   too big for my taste if i do that.  <br>
        The script has already made aliases for 6, 7 and 8 pt. fonts refer
 to  what's  really the 9 point  version of it. Applications that want to
use them, now  "find" the small fonts, but what they display is size 9. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For the sake of comparision: Here is my own
    <a href="http://home.online.no/%7Erut-aane/sample.txt">fonts.alias</a>   for TT fonts, but it may contain 
fonts   you don't have, so do NOT copy it as such! Use mkfontalias.py and 
then finetune    It's quick, and if fonts you don't have are defined in the 
script, it simply   ignores them. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When all filemaking and editing is done:
To activate the aliases we restart xfs. You don't have to exit X first, just: 
    <br>
      <b>xset fp rehash</b></font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Then the final makeup: <br>
        After the file is created: Restart Netscape. <br>
        Open "preferences/fonts" and select: <br>
        "Allow Scaling" for variable width font <br>
        Check the checkbox for "use document-specified fonts". <br>
        Then select "Arial (monotype)" as your Variable Width Font and choose 
  font-size  12 in the upper dropbox. <br>
        Click OK. </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If after all this some fonts still look crappy:
    It's CSS bugs! Go to prefs/advanced and disable stylesheets to cure it.
  The  only bad stylesheet page i know of is Altavista where the error seems
  to occur for fonts defined as a % of a size. The new Netscape will handle
  this beautifully however, and Mozilla already does. <br>
         There is of course a lot more to dealing with fonts under X. Later 
 you   may want to add aliases for larger fonts, for instance. I'll add more 
 info   later when i get in the spirit ;) </font></p>
           
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A little <b>WARNING</b> to the incurably
curious: <br>
        If you get bloodthirsty after the success with TT-fonts: Be aware 
that   you  must be very very careful if you mess  around with fonts.alias 
files   in *other  font directories* than the truetype one. Some aliases <b>
must  be available  at all times!</b>  In particular you should keep your 
fingers  away from the  fonts.alias in the /misc directory. There the vital 
aliases  for  "fixed" and "variable" must be the first two entries mentioned. 
Mess  that up and X won't start. Also be careful with fonts.dir and fonts.scale
  files - don't fool around with them unless you mean it ;) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">   This is an area with a few pitfalls and 
  I'll give you a link covering it  better than I could. There's a variety 
 of protocols for dialup connections.  PPP is the one you'll want for Internet 
  use with a modem. RedHat has an excellent  and <a href="http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/tips/PPP-Client-Tips/PPP-Client-Tips.html">
        up to date howto</a>  full of hints and details about how to see
what  responses   the modem in the other end expect. There is no such thing
as a "windows"  or "Linux" ISP. If they can be connected to - they CAN be
connected  to. However,  it's common that ISP's won't know up from down on
a Linux system,  so their  support for Linux users can be meager. </font></p>
           
<p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">  Before you start you need to know the IP
of your ISP's nameserver. In my  case, it turned out all I needed of info 
  apart from that IP was the instructions  under "Setting up PPP with Linuxconf". 
  After having read that it took me 5 minutes to connect to my ISP first time
  and I had never done this before.   </font></p>
           
<p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Windows users who never struggled with modem 
  configuration under DOS may wonder about drivers:  In normal cases 
you don't need a "driver" for a modem. The drivers you install under MS Windows
  are in many cases basically  just some strings added to the register,
  adding info about which port the modem is on and what initialization strings
  it requires under various conditions. (When it's used to dial an ISP, when
  it's used for voice, fax, how it's supposed to be reset etc.)</font></p>
       
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I use a Rockwell v90 based modem and have
  this line in </font>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/chat-ppp0<br>
    '' 'AT&amp;FM0+MS=56'</p>
       
<p>That works well. The "FM0" here simply tells the modem to use default
factory settings. This may vary from modem to modem. If FM0 doesn't work
- try FM1 or FM2.<br>
    In addition, the basic reset-string in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ppp0
  is:<br>
    INITSTRING="ATZ"</p>
       
<p>I'll add the whole set of files to compare with, but again: It shouldn't
  be neccesary to worry too much about them.<br>
    </p>
       
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">--<br>
     If you notice errors about missing compression - it's there but not
yet    aliased: Add this to /etc/conf.modules (may be called modules.conf
on non-redhat    systems) </font></p>

<ul>
      <font face="Arial,Helvetica">  </font>            <li> <font face="Arial,Helvetica">
   Choose hardware compression. Most modem   support it and it's quicker
than  software compression.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">   Set connection speed 
to the highest   number you find, like 115200 bps. Never  hurts - probably 
helps.</font></li>

 Your assigned IP when online via PPP is found by writing "/sbin/ifconfig".
