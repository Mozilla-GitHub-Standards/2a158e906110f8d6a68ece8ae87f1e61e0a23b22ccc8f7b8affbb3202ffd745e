Summary</H3>

<UL>This document discusses design principles used for the menus in Netscape
Communicator.</UL>

<H3>
Design Goals</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Keep the menus simple.</LI>

<LI>
Menus must be consistent across components as much as possible, while respecting
platform guidelines and capabilities.</LI>

<LI>
Develop highly stable core menus (such as File, Edit, View, Communicator)
while grouping dynamic menu items separately.</LI>

<LI>
Support accelerators that have been assigned in previous versions</LI>

<LI>
Use menus as a way to integrate the suite of components in Communicator.</LI>
</UL>

Principles and Guidelines</H3>
<B>Menu titles</B>
<UL><I>Windows</I>
<UL>From the <I><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/uiguide/default.htm">Windows
Interface Guidelines for Software Design</A></I>, 1995 by Microsoft Corporation
<UL>A menu bar is an area displayed across the top of the window directly
below the title bar. Each menu title provides access to a drop-down menu
composed of a collection of menu items. The content of the menu bar and
its drop-down menus are determined by the functionality of the application
and the context of the user's interaction.

<P>Users can cancel a drop-down menu by pressing the ALT key whenever the
menu bar is active.  This not only closes the drop-down menu, it deactivates
the menu bar. Pressing the ESC key also cancels a drop-down menu. However,
the ESC key cancels only the current menu level.  For example, if
a drop-down menu is open, pressing ESC closes the drop-down menu, but leaves
its menu title highlighted. Pressing ESC a second time unhighlights the
menu title and deactivates the menu bar, returning input focus to the content
information in the window.

<I>Macintosh</I>
<UL>From the <I><A HREF="http://devworld.apple.com/dev/techsupport/insidemac/HIGOS8Guide/HIGuidelines-2.html">Macintosh
Human Interface Guidelines</A></I>, 1992 by Apple Computer
<UL>The menu bar extends across the top of the screen and contains words
and icons that serve as the title of each menu.  The application's
menu titles should remain consistent. When the mouse button is down while
the pointer is over the menu title, a pull-down menu appears.  The
application highlights the menu title and displays the menu. Users can
move the mouse away from the pull-down menu and release the mouse button
in order to "cancel" a pull-down menu.
<BR> </UL>
</UL>
<I>UNIX</I>
<UL>Generally, we follow the Windows convention for the UNIX platform.</UL>
 </UL>
<B>Accelerators</B>
<UL><I>Windows</I>
<UL>The modifier key for accelerators on Windows is Ctrl.
<BR> </UL>
<I>Macintosh</I>
<UL>The modifier key for accelerators on the Mac OS is Command (the key
next to the space bar with an Apple on it).
<BR> </UL>
<I>UNIX</I>
<UL>The modifier key for accelerators on UNIX is Alt.</UL>

<BR>Generally we'd like to keep menu accelerators consistent across the
application, so that ctrl-N will always create a new Navigator window,
regardless of the component being used.  Users benefitted from this
design because they didn't have to think about what they were currently
doing in order to open a new window.  However, as Communicator gets
larger and we invent more menu items, and as Communicator gets componentized,
keeping menu accelerators consistent across the application may be more
difficult to achieve and maintain.</UL>
<B>Keyboard Access Keys (Mnemonics)</B>
<UL><I>Windows</I>
<UL>From the <I><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/uiguide/default.htm">Windows
Interface Guidelines for Software Design</A></I>, 1995 by Microsoft Corporation
<UL>An access key is an alphanumeric key -- sometimes referred to as a
<I>mnemonic</I> -- that when used in combination with the ALT key navigates
to and activates a control.  For example, pressing ALT+O activates
a control whose label is "Open" and whose assigned access key is "O".
Typically, access keys are not case sensitive.

<P>Assign access keys characters to controls using the following guidelines
(in order of choice):
<OL>
<LI>
The first letter of the label for the control, unless another letter provides
a better mnemonic association.</LI>

<LI>
A distinctive consonant in the label.</LI>

<LI>
A vowel in the label.</LI>
</OL>
 </UL>
</UL>
<I>Macintosh</I>
<UL>There are no mnemonics on the Macintosh platform.
<BR> </UL>
<I>UNIX</I>
<UL>Generally, we follow the Windows convention for the UNIX platform.</UL>
 </UL>
<B>Mac-like menus vs. Cross-platform consistency</B>
<UL>Mac applications typically have static menu items for a single application,
with menu items disabled when they cannot be activated.  Because Communicator
appears to be a suite of applications but is actually one application,
there has been considerable debate as to whether the Macintosh Communicator
menus should be more classic Mac-like or behave as if Communicator were
truly componentized.  For now, we have erred on the side of cross-platform
consistency, for several reasons.  First, including all menu items
in all menus everywhere in the application would result in extremely long
menus.  Second, our long-term plan is to componentize the product,
in which case having all menu items in all menus everywhere is irrelevant.
Third, if all menu titles were to be included, Communicator would have
an extremely long menu title (File, Edit, View, Go, Message, Insert, Format,
Tools, Bookmarks, Communicator, Help).  This menu title would be insufficiently
long and unusable.  We have not collected usability data as to whether
this unMac-like menu system has an effect on usability, although some designers
previously employed at Apple have cited studies done there that show that
users care most about having the commands they need in the menu when they
need them, and care less about whether the menu titles and commands are
static.

<P>There are some cases where we prefer Mac-like menus over cross-platform
consistency.  Macintosh applications typically group Close with Save.
 Windows users, as we have observed in the usability lab, prefer Close
grouped with Exit at the bottom of the File menu.  "Clear" is used
in the Edit menu instead of "Delete".</UL>
<B>Core menu titles</B>
<UL>Throughout Communicator, the following menu titles are used (in this
order):  File, Edit, View, Communicator, Help.  Dynamic menu
titles which are specific to the component (Insert, Format, Tools, Message,
Go) appear between View and Communicator.</UL>
<B>New submenu</B>
<UL>The New submenu aims to integrate the product so that users can invoke
a new Navigator window, a new New Message window, or a New Blank Page window
anywhere within Communicator.  We felt it was important to be able
to do this because we wanted to allow users to naturally transition from
one component to another without having to think about which component
they currently were using.  Below these items are a separator, followed
by "New" menu items specific to the component.  For example, in the
Address Book window, the New submenu might look like this:
<BR>
<UL>Navigator Window
<BR>New Message
<BR>Blank Page
<BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="20%">
<BR>Card...
<BR>List...
<BR>Personal Address Book...</UL>


<P>The New submenu in the Inbox window might look like this:
<BR>
<UL>Navigator Window
<BR>New Message
<BR>Blank Page
<BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="20%">
<BR>Folder...
<BR>Discussion Group Server...
<BR> </UL>
</UL>
<B>Communicator menu</B>
<UL> The Communicator menu is another menu that is used to unify and
integrate the product.  First-class windows (i.e. Communicator components)
are listed first, with the corresponding accelerator being the modifier
key + the numerical order in which it appears in the menu.  Under
the first-class windows is a separator, followed by second-class windows
(i.e. "tools"-type windows).  The third set of items in the Communicator
menu are the window titles of the open Communicator windows.

<P>We have observed in usability studies that users have a hard time finding
items in the Communicator menu because it is too long.  This is a
problem that should be addressed in future designs:  how do we provide
menu access to all windows and components while making them discoverable
and easy to access quickly without cluttering the menus and/or the menu
title?
