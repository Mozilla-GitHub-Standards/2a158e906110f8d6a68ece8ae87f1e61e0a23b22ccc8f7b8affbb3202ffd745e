<b><font color="darkblue">Template Notes in dark blue</font>
<br>Example text in black</b>

<p><font color="darkblue">This template is designed for a frame-less HTML document with many different pages, but it can also be used as the top of a single-paged document, in which case the links in the table would be to anchors further down on the page rather than different pages.

<p>As with all of these templates, the format can be handled in different ways. The grey table is a good way to distinguish things such as chapter listings from regular text or any explanations you may have, as I do here. This template is, in a way, a book template, since the TOC suggests a basic book layout you can follow when you have a lot of different information that needs to be gathered into a single area. Note that when you use a TOC on a separate page, you should have links back to it in each of the chapters so readers don't lose track of the contents of the whole document.
