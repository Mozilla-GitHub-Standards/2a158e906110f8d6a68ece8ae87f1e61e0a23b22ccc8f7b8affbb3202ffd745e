<title>The document Interface</title>

<para>In the DOM, the document object provides a general way to
represent HTML, XHTML1 <footnote><para>In Gecko, XHTML documents are
supported as XML documents, and do not currently support the <varname>
HTMLDocument</varname> interface listed here.</para></footnote>, and XML
documents. In addition to the generalized document interface, the APIs
listed here include <varname> HTMLDocument</varname> , which is a more
specialized interface for dealing with HTML documents (e.g., <varname>
cookie</varname> , <varname> alinkColor</varname> ). Interfaces that are part
of this more specialized HTML document have asterisks next to them in
the table below.

<footnote><para> The <varname>Document</varname>interface that
document implements is more general than <varname>HTMLDocument</varname>,
which derives from it. <varname>Document</varname> is the interface that
provides such basic hierarchy-manipulating methods and properties as
<varname>childNodes</varname> , <varname>firstChild</varname> , 
<varname>nodeType</varname>, and others.</para></footnote></para>


<para>The <varname>document</varname> is contained by the <varname>
window</varname> object (see <filename>DOM window Reference</filename>
) and may contain any number of elements (see DOM Element Reference.)</para>

<para> As you can see from the lists below, the interfaces on
<varname> document</varname> deal with such things as the document
type, features of the document such as its color and formatting, the
plugins and applets that are exposed to the user in the document, as
well as methods for creating all of the document's
child nodes, or elements that typically live in the structural
representation of the whole document, such as the <varname>
&lt;BODY&gt;</varname> element, a <varname> &lt;TABLE&gt;</varname>
and so forth.</para>
