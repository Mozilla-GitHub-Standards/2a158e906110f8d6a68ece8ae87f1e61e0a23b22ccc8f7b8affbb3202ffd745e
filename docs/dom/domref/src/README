GECKO DOM REFERENCE SOURCE

dom_all.xml is the XML output from the FrameMaker source files. All of
the information in the book is in this XML file, albeit in a not very
usable markup. I have also removed all of the anchors, since DocBook
can build its own cross-referencing scheme.

domref.xml is the skeleton for a DocBook version of the Gecko DOM
Reference. Its external entities point to the various chapters of the
domref (e.g., elref.xml, docref.xml, etc.). The document subdirectory
is where I have begun to make separate XML files of each of the
attributes which are then included in the main docref.xml file there,
which in turn is included in the domref.xml book.
