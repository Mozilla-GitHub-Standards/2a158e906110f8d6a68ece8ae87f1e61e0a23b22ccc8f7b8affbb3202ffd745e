<h1>Mozilla Application Suite - Transition Plan</h1>

<p><i>March 10, 2005</i></p>

<p>In 2003 <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/roadmap.html#a-new-roadmap">we announced</a> our intention to shift development focus from the
integrated <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla Application Suite</a> (commonly referred to as "Seamonkey") to
a new generation of applications -- the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> browser and the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> mail and news client.  That
shift in focus occurred almost immediately, as the Mozilla Foundation
was formed and we hired the lead developers for Mozilla Firefox and
Mozilla Thunderbird.  At that time we also stated our intention to
maintain a long-lived, stable 1.7.x version of Seamonkey.  We noted that
a number of commercial distributors ship Seamonkey and will need the
means to maintain it for their customers.  There is also a user and
developer base that is fond of Seamonkey and would like to maintain it.
We have continued with this maintenance plan as well, with a 1.7.6 release scheduled for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>In the last few months we have also been releasing a series of 1.8 alpha
and beta releases.  The goal of these releases has been to test the
changes to the back-end aspects of our codebase.  Most users are
familiar only with the "front-end" of our code -- the actual end user
applications that provide browsing and mail functionality.  But
underneath this layer of code is a deep, complex layer of infrastructure
that makes things work behind the scenes.  There's no reason for end
users to be aware of this foundation, just as most of us aren't aware of
the details of the foundation of the skyscrapers we visit.  But it is
critical, and continued development and testing of this layer is vital
to keeping our applications healthy.</p>

<p>The ongoing alpha and beta releases of Seamonkey 1.8 have suggested that
the Mozilla Foundation itself will be creating a 1.8 final release.
This is not our plan.  The 1.8 releases have been for testing our
backend.  We intend that the 1.7.x line of releases will be the last
long-lived, maintained versions released by the Mozilla Foundation.
There is no doubt that the series of 1.8 alpha and beta releases have
caused some confusion about whether there would be a 1.8 product
released by the Mozilla Foundation.  In addition, a set of people have
done a non-trivial amount of work on 1.8 features, thinking this would
be part of an official Mozilla Foundation release.   This has been a major
error on our part.  These contributors have reason to be unhappy with
us. We can only apologize, at the same time recognizing that apologies only go so far and can't
fix the error.</p>

<p>Our plan for the Seamonkey suite is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The 1.7.x line will be the last set of Seamonkey products released and
maintained by the Mozilla Foundation. The Mozilla Foundation will
provide infrastructure for those interested in working on the 1.7.x
releases, which we expect will include a number of vendors who provide
these products to their customers. We've committed to support the 1.7
branch some time ago. If we ship 1.8 we'll need to support that as
well, and we just can't manage supporting that many versions as well as Firefox
and Thunderbird releases.</li>
<li>The Mozilla Foundation will provide infrastructure support (CVS
access, bugzilla, development tools, etc) for community members who wish
to continue to develop Seamonkey. This community group may wish to do
formal releases of Seamonkey, much as the Sunbird and Minimo developers
do. We support this. We probably won't use the same naming
conventions, as we need to be clear that this is not a Mozilla
Foundation product release.</li>
<li>Boris Zbarsky has <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bzbarsky/Public/SeaMonkey.txt">posted an open letter to the Mozilla Foundation</a>
signed by a set of interested parties, laying out a community transition
plan. We support this plan and will work with interested parties to
figure out strategy. There will undoubtedly be  some
implementation details to be worked out (e.g., can we actually use
Seamonkey as a formal trademark, how do we work the tinderbox machines,
etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>
The dedication to the product, the initiative of the developers and the
proposal of the transition plan as a solution are all hallmarks of the
Mozilla community. We support this effort completely.
