<div class="section">
  <h2><a name="adding">Adding Files</a></h2>

  <div class="section">
    <h3><a name="filenames">Filenames</a></h3>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Use descriptive file names.</strong> The ideal filename
     is succinct, specific enough to be descriptive, but general enough to
     accommodate change or expansion (e.g. becoming a folder). Don't just
     copy the page's title, as it isn't always appropriate for a
     filename.</p>

    <li><p><strong>Avoid abbrev.</strong> It makes the URL that much
     harder to read and remember. We are not limited to 8.3 names, so make
     the file names as long as necessary (and no longer).</p>

    <li><p><strong>Don't use page/part numbers.</strong> Don't name
     Chapter 4 <code class="filename">ch4</code>, because someday you may
     want to insert another chapter between Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. Name
     it after the chapter's title instead; this is also more descriptive.
     The only numbers in filenames should be dates and application version
     numbers.</p>

    <li><p><strong>Filenames are lowercase.</strong> It makes URLs
     consistent throughout the site, and it's easier to remember the URL
     when case isn't an issue. The exception is documenting code: a doc on
     <code>nsFoo</code> should be <code class="filename">nsFoo.html</code>,
     not <code class="filename">nsfoo.html</code>, to match the code's casing.
     In no event should you have two files in the same directory that differ
     only in case: don't have <code class="filename">Foo</code> and <code
     class="filename">FOO</code>.</p>

    <li><p><strong>Hyphenate.</strong> Don't use StudlyCaps to separate
     words. You can't use uppercase anyway. Use hyphens. Don't use
     underscores to separate words; underscores don't show up in
     underlined text.</p>

    <li><p><strong>Don't use funny characters in file names.</strong>
     Stick to alphanumerics and hyphen. Our server is a Unix machine, and
     life gets somewhat more difficult if you use files with spaces,
     ampersands, quotes, and so on in their names. <code
     class="filename">this-and-that</code> is good. <code
     class="filename">This&amp;That.HTM</code> is bad. You will royally
     screw anyone using a Macintosh (and Windows, I think) if you use
     colons, so don't do that.</p>

    <li><p><strong>Avoid redundancy; don't over-qualify.</strong> <code
     class="filename">dom/domref/dom-window-ref</code> is too much&#8212;<code
     class="filename">dom/reference/window</code> is better.</p>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h3><a name="location">Location</a></h3>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Pick (or create) the most logical location for the
     document.</strong> Get a feel for the site's organization and fit the
     document where it most belongs. <!-- Look at the site through it's tree
     structure rather than through the site navigation to get a better
     idea of where things go. The URI you're assigning to that file is
     more or less permanent, so it has to be forwards-compatible. Choose
     well, and run the new location past someone else before
     publicizing.--></p>

    <li><p><strong>Use subfolders.</strong> If you have a few files that
     belong together, or <em>if you expect to</em>, make a subfolder that
     contains all the related files.</p>
<!--
    <li><p><strong>You can change a file to a directory!</strong> If
     something logically belongs under what is right now a file, make it
     the <code class="filename">index.html</code> of a folder with the
     same name and put your file inside that folder. So if you want to add
     a related page, or split a long page into several sub-pages, or add
     an image, you can do that.</p>
-->
    <li><p><strong>A file's images go in its folder.</strong> Don't create
     an "images" folder. For example, a <code
     class="filename">roadmap/</code> (<code
     class="filename">roadmap/index.html</code>) would put its diagram at
     <code class="filename">roadmap/diagram</code>. If the same image is
     used in several pages, then put it in the deepest common
     folder.</p>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2><a name="linking">Linking, Anchors, and URLs</a></h2>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Don't point to <code class="filename">index.html</code>
   directly.</strong> Point to the directory rather than the <code
   class="filename">index.html</code> file. (Include the trailing
   slash.)</p>

  <li><p><strong>No file extensions on DevMo.</strong> Drop the
   file extension when linking to files on developer.mozilla.org.
   This way we can change the format of a file without changing the
   content. Also, files can expand to become directories later on.</p>

  <li><p><strong>Use relative links whenever practical.</strong> This
   reflects the relationship between the two documents, and the link
   won't break if, for instance, someone copies the documents to a
   test site.</p>

  <li><p><strong>Use <code class="markup">id="anchor-name"</code> for
   intra-page anchors</strong> <em>except</em> for navigation leading
   up to a download, in which case use
   <code class="markup">&lt;a name="anchor-name"&gt;</code>. Linking
   to an ID isn't supported in many older browsers, and the visitor just
   might be trying to update an outdated system. Also, anchors should,
   like filenames, be lower case.</p>

  <li><p><strong>Anchors should not be empty.</strong> They should
   enclose some relevant fragment of text. For example, to create an
   anchor for a section add the <code class="markup">id</code> attribute
   to an enclosing <code class="markup">&lt;div class="section"&gt;</code>
   (if there is one) or to the heading tag itself (if there isn't). If
   using <code class="markup">&lt;a name="anchor-name"&gt;</code>, place
   the anchor tags around the full text of the heading, not an empty
   string just before it. If this is done right, highlighting all anchors'
   text can be a meaningful and useful styling.</p>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2><a name="code">Page Code</a></h2>
  <div class="section">
    <h3><a name="format">Code Format</a></h3>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Use the ISO-8859-1 aka. Latin-1 character
     encoding.</strong> Represent characters that are outside the
     ISO-8859-1 repertoire (eg. typographically correct dashes and quotes)
     as decimal numeric character references. For example, encode the em
     dash (&#8212;) as <code>&amp;#8212;</code>.</p>
     <p>Do not use references to Windows CP1252 code points even if they
     appear to work. That is, do not use <code>&amp;#151;</code> for em
     dash (or any other references to the 128&#8230;159 range).</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Use short lines.</strong> Some HTML editors like to
     produce documents that only insert line breaks in the HTML source at
     the ends of paragraphs. Don't do that. Use editors that give the HTML
     source sensibly short lines. If every paragraph is one long line,
     then <span class="command">diff</span> is mostly useless (since
     <span class="command">diff</span> is line-oriented.) Also there's
     always the chance that some random Unix utility is going to blow a
     buffer. Don't go there.</p>

    <li><p>Lowercase is preferred (but not required) for HTML tags and
     attributes.</p>

    <li><p><strong>Don't use <code
     class="markup">&amp;nbsp;</code> unnecessarily.</strong> The fact
     of life of HTML is that sentences don't end in two spaces. Accept
     it. Don't try to work around it by using <code class="markup">&amp;nbsp;</code>.
     Corollary: use <code class="markup">&lt;pre&gt;</code> if you need
     to; not <code class="markup">&lt;tt&gt;</code> and a bucketful of
     non-breaking spaces. <!-- Note that the site stylesheets already assign
     no-breaking rules to code and filenames
     and the like, so if you mark the text up properly, things will take
     care of themselves. --></p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3><a name="validation">Validation</a></h3>
    <p><strong>All new pages should validate as HTML 4.01 Strict</strong>
     using the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator</a>. This
     ensures that the page doesn't have syntax errors, that it can be
     processed by all sorts of more obscure browsers, and that it doesn't
     use the presentational markup deprecated in HTML 4.0. Also, we're
     making one of the most standards-compliant browsers around. It would
     be bad show to have an incompliant website.</p>
     <p>You can validate against HTML 4.01 Transitional instead, but only
     if there's a good reason. (The <code class="markup">&lt;font&gt;</code>
     tag is not a good reason.)</p>
<!--
    <p>Any exceptions to this rule (e.g. <code
     class="markup">&lt;textarea wrap='x'&gt;</code>) must be approved by
     the <a href="mailto:webmaster@mozilla.org">site webmaster</a>.</p>
-->
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3><a name="markup">Markup</a></h3>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong class="very-strong">Use semantic markup.</strong>
     Semantic markup explains why something should be styled rather than
     how it should be styled. This lets different style sheets and
     different browsers present the same idea differently and still be
     correct. <code class="markup">&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code
     class="markup">&lt;code&gt;</code>, and <code
     class="markup">&lt;em&gt;</code> are semantic elements. <code
     class="markup">&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code
     class="markup">&lt;i&gt;</code> are not. Stylistic information
     belongs in the style sheet, not the markup. Nearly everything else is
     corollary. So:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Presentational markup is <em>discouraged</em> on mozilla.org even
       if it's allowed in HTML 4.01 Strict.
      <li>Use <code class="markup">&lt;p&gt;</code> to <em>enclose</em>
       paragraphs, not <code class="markup">&lt;br&gt;</code> or <code
       class="markup">&lt;p&gt;</code> to separate them.
      <li>Use <a
       href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#h-7.5.5">Headings</a>
       for headings, not an arbitrary combination of <code
       class="markup">&lt;b&gt;</code>, <code
       class="markup">&lt;big&gt;</code>, and/or <code
       class="markup">&lt;hr&gt;</code>.
      <li>Don't use tables for layout. Tables are for tabular data. Text
       columns are not tabular data.
      </ul>
    <p>You are encouraged to use the markup conventions defined in our
     <a href="/contribute/writing/markup">Markup Reference</a> if you want
     a richer presentation.</p>

    <div class="note">Recommended Reading: <a
     href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/documentation/reference/html/ch01.html#AEN367">"Structured
     and Semantic Markup"</a> from <cite>DocBook: The Definitive
     Guide</cite> (in Chapter 1) It's about 5 pages in the print
     version (4 pages printed), and worth the few minutes it takes to
     read.</div>

    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3><a name="style">Adding Style</a></h3>

    <p><strong>Check the classes defined in the <a href="/contribute/writing/markup">Markup
     Reference</a> first</strong>. The Reference defines a number of
     commonly-used classes that already have styles associated with them,
     so you may not need to write any style rules. Also, if you think
     something's missing from the Reference, file a bug asking fantasai to
     add it instead of working around the deficiency in your corner of the
     site.</p>

    <h4>Localized Style Rules</h4>
    <p>Stylistic information is centralized into several site-wide style
     sheets. This way, the site has a coherent look and feel and the
     formatting conventions are consistent. However, the site style sheets
     can't handle everything, so some pages may need to incorporate
     additional rules for local use or to handle specific page
     layouts.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Don't depend on any particular presentation for an
     element or class.</strong> HTML allows for alternate styles, which
     means different visitors can use different style sheets. You can
     depend on a set of sensible style rules, but don't depend on, e.g.
     all filenames being rendered in a monospaced font. A style might
     decide to make them italic serif.</p>
    <li><p><strong>No inline styles.</strong> The <code>style</code>
     attribute is banned from mozilla.org pages with two exceptions:
     <code>float</code> and <code>clear</code>. Use semantic markup and
     either <code class="markup">&lt;link&gt;</code>ed style sheets or
     <code class="markup">&lt;style&gt;</code>.</p>
    <li><p>If the same rules are used on more than one page, put them in a
     separate style sheet file placed in the deepest folder common to
     these files.</p>
    <li><p><strong>Avoid creating presentational classes.</strong>
     <code>class="center"</code> is no better than
     <code>align="center"</code>.</p>
    <li><p><strong>Do not set <code>font-family</code>.</strong> The font
     is handled by site style sheets. Other font properties are allowed,
     but don't change the font for the entire page (e.g. don't set
     <code>font-size: small</code> on <code
     class="markup">&lt;body&gt;</code>).</p>
    <li><p><strong>Avoid setting any colors</strong> on individual pages.
     </p>
      <p>If for some reason you need to set specific colors:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Make sure you reset all the element's children as well.
      <li>Make color rules <code>!important</code>.
      <li>Never set a text color without also setting a background color,
       and vice versa.
      <li>Use the <code>background</code> shorthand property, not
       <code>background-color</code> or <code>background-image</code>.
      <li>If you're using a background image, also set a matching
       background color.
      </ul>
      <div class="example">
        <pre class="code"><!--
        -->.class {
<!--				-->    color: black !important;
<!--				-->    background: gray url(slate.gif) !important;
<!--				-->}
<!--				-->.class * {
<!--				-->    color: inherit !important;
<!--				-->    background: transparent !important;
<!--				-->}<!--
        --></pre>
      </div>
    <li><p><strong>Make sure multiple window sizes work.</strong> Resize
     the window, both narrow and wide. Another common mistake made by
     people using HTML editors is the presence of random <code
     class="markup">&lt;br&gt;</code> tags at the ends of lines.</p>
    <li><p><strong>Pages must look decent in NS4+, MSIE4+, and
     Mozilla.</strong> Try to avoid exposing bugs in their CSS support; at
     the very least, make the page legible. A very useful resource is Eric
     Meyer's <a
     href="http://devedge.netscape.com/library/xref/2003/css-support/css1/mastergrid.html">Master
     Compatibility Chart</a>. If you must, block a problem browser from
     accessing your style sheet&#8212;but try to do it without scripting, ok?
     For example, @import a style sheet NS4.x shouldn't see or block out
     sections with the <a href="http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=CaioHack">comment
     hack</a>.</p>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2><a name="content">Content</a></h2>
  <div class="section">
    <h3><a name="meta">Meta Information</a></h3>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Each document's author should be listed at the
     top.</strong> If it's a communal document, or an index, it's ok to
     leave the author off. But if it's a document with real content, it
     should list a way of contacting the author and providing feedback.
     Anonymity is bad.</p>
    <p> Look at the top of the document you're reading right now for the
     suggested format.</p>

    <li><p><strong>Add meta <code>description</code></strong> to help indexing.
      The description text should be an <em>abstract</em> of the page.
      If you're adding a <code>keywords</code> tag as well, pick keywords
      that you would use if you forgot the URI and were searching for the page,
      not just any remotely relevant word that comes to mind.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <pre class="code">
<!--   -->&lt;meta name="description"
<!--   -->      content="Rules and guidelines for writing documents on

        </pre>
      </div>

    <li><p><strong>Use <code class="markup">&lt;link&gt;</code> elements
     to link to related documents.</strong> It will improve the navigation
     for visitors using a browser (like Mozilla) that supports this HTML
     2.0 feature. <code class="markup">&lt;link&gt;</code> denotes
     relationships between the entire page and another resource (as
     opposed to <code class="markup">&lt;a&gt;</code>, which is a context
     link; the relationship denoted applies to the immediate context of
     the anchor element). <!-- explanation courtesy of Ian Hickson and
     Christopher Hoess - see bug 87428. --></p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3><a name="writing-form">Writing Form</a></h3>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Avoid all caps.</strong> If the uppercase is used for
     style (e.g. for <strong class="very-strong">emphasis</strong>), let the
     style sheet handle it. If you are talking about SOME_RANDOM_C_TOKEN,
     make sure you mark it with <code class="markup">&lt;code&gt;</code>.</p>

    <li><p><strong>mozilla.org is spelled in lowercase.</strong> The name
     of the application is <strong>Mozilla</strong>. It is a proper noun,
     and is therefore capitalized. The name of the organization is
     <strong>mozilla.org</strong>. It is a host name, and therefore, is
     lowercase. Even if it is at the beginning of a sentence, it should
     always be lowercase. If it bothers you to begin a sentence with a
     lowercase word, rephrase the sentence. (It's not hard.) Never type
     Mozilla.org.</p>

    <li><p><strong>Use proper capitalization for titles and
     headings.</strong> This keeps capitalization consistent throughout
     mozilla.org. Also, although CSS can manipulate case, it can't do
     proper capitalization&#8212;so that needs to be written in.</p>

    <li><p><strong>Use a spell checker.</strong> Say no more.</p>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3><a name="writing-style">Writing Style</a></h3>
    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Eschew marketing obfuscation.</strong> These are
     technical documents, folks. One of the things that people seem to like
     best about the existing content on mozilla.org is that it is written
     by people, for people, without bluster or self-promotion.</p>

      <p>When describing something, don't tell people how great it is. Don't
       tell them how useful it is. Tell them what it does. Tell them what
       it's for.</p>

      <p>Don't use buzzwords. Instead, say what you mean. Never use a long
       word where a short one would do. If it's possible to cut a word out,
       cut it out.</p>

      <p>Read George Orwell's <a
       href="http://www.k-1.com/Orwell/site/work/essays/language.html"
       ><cite>Politics
       and the English Language</cite></a>. Read it again. Have it tattooed
       on the inside of your eyelids.</p>

    <li><p><strong>Separate technical and religious topics.</strong> It is
     ok to publish documents which advocate potentially controversial ideas
     or approaches. However, it is generally better if such advocacy not be
     in the same document as technical information. For example, a document
     explaining what you have to do in order to successfully use C++ is a
     good thing; and a document arguing that you should not use C++ is also
     a good thing; however, they should not be the same document, because
     the controversial part might cause the readers to disregard the
     factual, non-controversial part, and miss out on important
     information.</p>

    <li><p><strong>Speak for yourself.</strong> You don't speak for
     mozilla.org. Don't make promises about what mozilla.org will or will
     not do in the future. Hedge your bets with words like might or (sometimes)
     probably.</p>

     <p>Be careful with the word we. It would be bad if you made some assertion
     about what mozilla.org (as a whole) believes or desires or likes, only to
     find that there are others in the organization who disagree.</p>

      <p>Also, if you are employed to work on Mozilla, keep in mind that you
       likely wear two hats: your company hat, where you are concerned with
       shipping branded software; and your mozilla.org hat, where you are
       concerned with shipping source code on which other developers can base
       their own works. These two jobs are not the same, and you should be
       careful not to conflate the two.</p>

    <li><p><strong>Don't play lawyer.</strong> Sometimes you may find
     yourself writing something about what is or is not allowed by the
     terms of the NPL, MPL, or some other license. Be very, very careful.
     It's probably best to say nothing at all, but if you must, you should
     defer to the authority of the license itself. Unless you actually
     <em>are</em> a lawyer, you're not qualified to interpret what it says,
     and you don't want to inadvertently say something that might get
     either mozilla.org or your employer into trouble.</p>
