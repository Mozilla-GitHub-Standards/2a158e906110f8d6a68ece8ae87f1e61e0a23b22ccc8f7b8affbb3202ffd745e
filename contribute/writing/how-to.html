    <h1>How to Document Mozilla</h1>
    <p class="author">by <a href="mailto:alecf@flett.org?Subject=How To Document comments">Alec Flett</a>
    <p>This document will attempt to explain the process by which you
      should document pieces of mozilla. In some sense this document is
      just a "how to be a tech writer" with lots of mozilla-specific
      information thrown in.
    </p>

    <p>For details on obtaining access to edit documents on mozilla.org, please
      see the <a href="process">contribution</a> page.

      This document does not cover formatting of your document, styles
      to use, HTML coding conventions, etc. (That is covered in the
      <a href="guidelines">Style Guide</a>.) It does include guidelines
      for document structure but many factors may determine the structure
      or approach for your document.

    <h2><a name="about">About your document</a></h2>
    <p>
      Before writing a document you need to determine exactly what you are
      trying to write. Is it an overview of a module? A guide for end-users?
      A FAQ for plugin authors? Once you have established the goal of the
      document, you will be able to rely on that goal when deciding what to
      include and what to ignore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below you will find a few important questions that you should know the
      answer to before you even begin.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="audience">Who is your audience?</a></h3>
    <p>
      Mozilla has many clients, and it is important to try to imagine
      yourself as one of these clients when reading your document. Not
      every client wants to read every document, so some amount of
      duplication among various documentation is fine. <strong>The key
      is to make sure your indended audience maintains interest and
      understanding of your subject matter.</strong> Think about how
      much you expect the reader to know. Constantly ask yourself if
      the material you are presenting is relevant and appropriate for
      your readers.
    </p>
    <p>A few of the more signifigant groups include:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Developers working on Mozilla itself</dt>
      <dd>These developers often need very precise descriptions of
        subsystems, lots of sample code, and so forth. Developers are
        often somewhat familiar with Mozilla already, and do not
        necessary need verbose descriptions of every little thing, but
        may need to know of obvious pitfalls and mistakes in the
        existing codebase. The history of a module or subsystem may be
        important to explain the design of existing code, in the case
        where legacy code does not necessarily reflect new directions
        that may be expressed in your document.
      <dt>Developers working on Mozilla extensions</dt>
      <dd>These developers interact with only a few specific modules,
        and may be less familiar with the codebase. Code or API history
        is not often relevant as they are developing for the current and
        future versions of the product and may not be exposed to legacy
        code. Public (frozen) APIs and private APIs may need
        distinction. Suggestions for the proper API to use for
        specific cases can be very helpful.
      <dt>Developers of other products who want to embed mozilla:</dt>
      <dd>These developers often do not care about the nitty gritty
        details of how a particular API works or where it is going. They
        often want a very process-oriented approach to plugging their
        own application into mozilla or vice-versa. Often they care only
        about binary compatibility with future version of Mozilla and
        thus should be steered towards frozen interfaces.
      <dt>End users</dt>
      <dd>Most end user documentation is found within the Mozilla product,
        but extra end user documentation on mozilla.org should not expect
        a lot of technical expertise from the reader.
      <dt>Others</dt>
      <dd>There are many permutations of prospective readers, and it is
        important that your target audience be defined, if only for
        yourself.
    </dl>
    <p>If you write a document, <i>Extending menus with Overlays</i>,
      you might ask yourself if the user knows what an overlay even is.
      If they don't know what one is you might decide instead to write
      <i>Extending menus in mozilla</i> and include a brief overview of
      how overlays allow extension of the UI.
      Or perhaps they know what an overlay is and have used them before
      to add icons and UI, but don't know anything about menus in
      particular. Your document might become a description of the
      positioning features of overlays, to make sure menu items appear
      in the right place.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="type">What kind of document will this be?</a></h3>
    <p>
      It is important to determine the type of document you are
      writing so that you can determine its structure. Otherwise you
      will just end up with a mishmash of tips and tricks without any
      obvious path to enlightenment in the area you are covering.
      <strong>Try to choose one document format, and <em>stick with
      it</em>.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      While you should feel freedom to structure your document in your
      own unique way, most readers are familiar with a few common
      document types. If you choose one of these document types, your
      users will be able to navigate your document easily. Here are a
      few suggestions:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>HowTo</dt>
      <dd> A HowTo is usually process oriented, and
        walks the user through a fairly real scenario. Tips and tricks
        are offered along the way, as well as possible
        pitfalls. Typical documents like this might include how to create a
        plugin, how to add an item to a menu, or how to add a new CSS
        property. HowTos often include a few large examples that the
        user learns over the course of the document.
      <dt>Reference</dt>
      <dd>API references are usually documents whose
        structures closely match those of a particular API. There
        might be a chapter for each class and a seperate section for
        each method.
      <dt>Module architecture guide</dt>
        <dd>This kind of document
        describes the inner workings of a particular module. It is
        often intended to flush out architecture problems and describe
        future direction of the module itself. Code history can
        explain existing architecture. Often these guides are
        intended soley for the current and future developers of the
        module. They may also include descriptions of how to extend
        the existing design.
      <dt>Module consumer guide</dt>
      <dd>This kind of document
        describes the external APIs for a module. Usually this
        document is intended for people who might use this module but
        do not necessarily care about how the module works or what
        future directions it may be taking internally. More elaborate
        than a simple <b>Reference</b>, the guide should show examples
        describing recommended practices and common patterns.
      <dt><abbr>FAQ</abbr> (Frequently Asked Questions)</dt>
      <dd>Usually this is just a list of topics that a
        reader should understand. Answers to the questions are often
        brief, giving an answer without justification and/or history,
        but reference other documents which describe the answer
        in much more detail.
      <dt>Technote:</dt>
      <dd>Sometimes a simple one or two page
        document sufficies to describe a very specific problem and
        solution. A technote is often much like a HowTo, but its scope
        is very limited and intends to document something very
        specific. No background is given and many assumptions are made
        about a user's prexisting knowledge. Sometimes technotes can evolve
        into full-fledged HowTo's.
      <dt>Other</dt>
      <dd>There are many other document types out there, and
        often the content or target of your document may determine
        your document type automatically. The key is to be flexible:
        creativly structure your document to engage and educate the
        reader, but present it in a familiar enough format that you do
        not scare someone away from finishing your document.
    </dl>
    <h3><a name="scope">Determine your scope</a></h3>
    <p>
      Scope is a particularly difficult problem. You need to decide if
      you are going to document an entire module, a simple process, an
      elaborate architecture, or something else. More often than not, documents
      try to cover too much, in too much detail. <strong>When in doubt, cover
      <em>less</em> rather than <em>more</em></strong>. If your document
      is only an architectural overview, don't go into detail on the use
      of strings in the module. If your document is about something as
      specific as character set conversion, don't discuss localization
      or how to avoid excess string copying.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the difficulties in determining the proper scope of your
      document is that readers themselves often can't determine what is useful
      information and what is not. If you examples are too complex, or
      you include too much detail, users don't know which aspect of
      you document is important, and which details are inconsequential.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest benefit from determining your scope is to limit how
      much you write. Here are a few <i>examples</i>, though the
      concept of scope is much less granular than some of the other
      questions above:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Module Overview</dt>
      <dd>A description of the structure of a
        module, including descriptions of the way subsystems interact
        within the module. Minor edge cases or anamolies in the design
        should be ignored or played down. Pictures and process
        flow will guide the user to understanding of the overall concepts,
        and leave it to the user to find specifics in other
        documents. An example might be a
        general overview of XPCOM which describes the concept of the
        component manager, factories, creating objects, and so
        forth. Further detail such as the details of creating a DLL
        might be better left to a seperate document which specifically
        describes the creation of a XPCOM dll.
      <dt>Subsystem guide</dt>
      <dd>A detailed guide describing a
        particular subsystem in great detail. An example of this might
        be a guide to array classes, which gives specific examples in
        C++ and JavaScript about accessing array members, manipulating
        arrays, and so forth.
      <dt>Tutorial</dt>
      <dd>When covering a specific topic in a tutorial fashion, it
        helps to make assumptions about what the user knows, and
        direct them to other more documents before straying off the
        course of the tutorial. When a writer feels the need to
        describe something like this more completely, a seperate
        document can be written describe this alternate topic. For
        example, in a tutorial about adding items to a menu using
        overlays, it is probably not useful to include a sample
        JavaScript component, let alone describe what the sample
        does.
      <dt>Others</dt>
      <dd>There is a tremendous range of possible scopes in documents.
        The above are only a small samples of possible scopes.
    </dl>
    <p>
      The important thing to remember is to keep your scope
      consistent throughout your document. The easist way to do this
      is to decide on your scope early in the writing process, and
      stick to it. If your document evolves to cover a greater (or
      lesser) scope, make sure to thoroughly check the entire document
      to ensure the level of detail and abstraction is consistent.

    <h2><a name="research">Gathering Information</a></h2>
    <p>
      Once you have planned out the overall direction of the document,
      you can begin research. If you are an expert in the area you
      intend to cover, then much of your research may simply be
      gathering minor details to ensure you document is complete.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="prior-art">Find Existing Documentation</a></h3>
    <p>
      It is important to be aware of existing documentation on the
      subject you are covering. As mentioned above, duplication of
      topics in documentation is fine, as long as another aspect of
      the document is different. For instance you might find a
      Reference for XPCOM, but you might notice that there is no
      tutorial. Use the details of the reference to develop your tutorial.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="code"></a>Read Code</h3>
    <p>
      As is often the case with open source projects, the code is the
      documentation for many modules. Developers are used to reading
      the source code of a module, as well as looking at other
      consumers, in order to learn how to use it.
    </p>
    <h3><a name="questions">Questions to ask</a></h3>
    <p>
      Before talking with developers, try to become as familiar with
      a module as possible before asking people about it. Most
      importantly, be ready with specific questions. Here are a few
      other tips and tricks for dealing with developers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Explain that you're writing documentation:</strong> If
        developers have a sense of <i>why</i> you're asking so many
        questions, they might be able to better direct you to places where
        you can learn more. They might also be willing to explain larger
        concepts if they realize that you're documenting, and not just
        hacking something together.
      <li><strong>Be sensitive to people's jobs:</strong> Like many folks
        working on mozilla, developers are usually overburdened and
        don't have time to hold your hand as you learn a new
        module. If a developer tells you to go learn something before
        asking any more questions, do it. Go back to the source and
        learn some more.
      <li><strong>Request examples in the source code:</strong> Often a
        developer is going to be adept at using tools to point you at
        good examples.
      <li><strong>Don't ask anyone to write code:</strong> Unless it is
        offered to you, don't expect anyone to write new examples for you.
        One option is to write your own example and ask a developer for
        critiques.
      <li><strong>If a developer isn't receptive, try someone else:</strong>
        Don't keep asking the same person the same thing over and
        over. If a developer blows you off, use CVS blame to find
        other experts, or ask him/her who else knows the module well.
      <li><strong>Demonstrate your current knowledge:</strong> Don't waste a
        developer's time with them trying to figure out what you do
        and do not know. Explain your current understanding, even if
        you think it might be wrong. A developer can often steer you
        the right way without having to go into lengthy explanations.
    </ul>
