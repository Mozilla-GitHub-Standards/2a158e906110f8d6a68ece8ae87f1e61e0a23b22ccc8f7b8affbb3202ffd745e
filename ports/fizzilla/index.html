<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>Apple shipped <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS
X</a>, a replacement to Mac OS based on top of Mach3 and BSD but with
the traditional Macintosh look and feel. In order to allow developers
to quickly port their existing Mac OS-based applications to Mac OS X,
Apple has created a portability layer named <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/carbon"><I>Carbon</I></a>.
Carbon takes the nearly 9000 Mac OS APIs, trims the dead weight, adds
some new stuff, and offers the remaining 6000 APIs for use on top of
Mac OS X. All developers need to do is tweak their existing Mac OS code
to fit the new Carbon API and their apps will run in a separate
process, taking full advantage of Mac OS X's memory protection and
pre-emptiveness.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Around May, 1999 (Mozilla milestone 5, or M5) we made those
modifcations to Mozilla and created a single binary that ran on both
Mac OS 8.5 and Mac OS X. The resulting app, code named <I>Fizzilla</I>,
made its public debut onstage at the Mac OS X Session at Apple's WWDC
'99. People liked it.

<p>In the time between May and December, 1999, Apple did a
significant amount of profiling work on Mac OS X using Fizzilla as a
test application. Their findings set us in a new direction which we
believe will yield the best possible solution for many of the
problems which have traditonally plagued our Mac OS products.

<p>Instead of relying fully on Carbon for the entire app, Apple
suggested a hybrid approach. For the front-end and drawing code, we
would use the same Mac OS code on top of Carbon that the Mac OS 8/9
product uses. However, on the backend, we could leverage the fact
that Mac OS X is BSD Unix under the hood and use our Unix codebase for
threading and networking. While this means that we'd no longer have a
single, "SuperFat" binary that runs on all Mac OS platforms, it would
be much faster than its Mac OS counterpart. Finally, because the
resulting app would be mach-o (not CFM), it would allow us to take
advantage of the threading libraries present in BSD as well as
Quartz, neither of which are available through the Carbon APIs.

<p>Since we're building the Unix code in addition to Carbon code, we
would also have to modify our build system. On Mac OS X, this would
require using gmake, just like our linux client. While it pains us to
give up the IDE, sharing as much as we can with the unix build system
will reduce the likelihood that Fizzilla will bitrot and not be able
to build anymore.

<p>Around April, 2000 (M12), Pavlov landed most of the work required
to get this new approach up and running and laying out HTML. The
problem was that the process was just too different, and due to the
state of gcc on OS X at the time, very difficult to build. The code
bitrotted, and the project stagnated.

<p>A few months later, Patrick Beard picked the project up off the
floor and got a build off M17 that many people have used. This build
was a CFM, fully Carbon build as per the original idea. In August
2001, Netscape took a branch of mozilla0.9.2 and shipped <I>Netscape
6.1 Preview for Mac OS X</I> based off the CFM build. It became a real
shipping product with <I>Netscape 6.2</I> (mozilla 0.9.4 branch).

<hr>

<H2>Where Are We Now?</H2>

<p>We now have many paths:

<ul>
   <li><a href="cfm.html">FizzillaCFM</a> -- fully Carbon, mac
   back-end, CFM based
   <li><a href="Mach.html">FizzillaMach</a> -- mac Carbon front-end,
   unix back-end, Mach-o based
   <li><a href="Cocoazilla.html">Cocoazilla</a> -- use Gecko from
   within the Cocoa framework
   <li><a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/development/dev_build.html">ChimChim (now Camino)</a> -- a Cocoa native UI
   that embeds Gecko through Cocoazilla
</ul>

<p>Each path has its own build instructions and its own set of flaws
and foibles and hence deserves its own page. The wonderful thing
about open source is that both can get the attention they
deserve.

<p>The big question, however, is "what is Netscape going to do post
Netscape6.2?" Even though we like the idea of FizzillaMach for the
future, the tools just aren't there yet. The benefits of being able
to leverage the existing OS 9 build system and tools for development
are too great given the small amount of time we have to work on this
on the side. Remember, Netscape's primary mission right now is to
ship Netscape6 for OS 9 and we cannot do anything to jeopardize that
plan. So where you will probably see the majority of the work is with
FizzillaCFM.

<p>We are not abandoning FizzillaMach by any stretch of the
imagination. Now is just not the time for it to shine. We have done
some preliminary tests and the Mach-o build is about 10-15% faster
than the corresponding CFM build. That's promising news!

<p>I've also got an update on our Cocoa story. Mac OS X 10.1 gave us
an objective-c++ compiler to supplement the existing mach-o build. I
still assert that nobody in their right mind would write in
objective-c, but writing in obj-C++ isn't quite so bad. As a result,
I've recently begun an effort to rewrite our Widget implementation
with Cocoa instead of Carbon using obj-c++. Currently, it limps
enough to surf webpages. I have yet to touch GFX.

<p>The main goal of the Cocoa effort is to provide something that can
be embedded using ProjectBuilder and InterfaceBuilder. By providing a
<I>NSBrowserView</I>, application developers can embed mozilla
directly into their applications or, if they choose, write a native
UI wrapper around it and make their own web browser. We are doing
this very thing with the <a href="ChimChim.html">Chim Chim</a>
project.

<h2>Special Thanks</h2>

<p>Many thanks to the following people at Apple for helping out: Eoin
Norris, Dave Evans, Curt Rothert, John Signa, Christine O'Sullivan,
John Chang, Skip Levins, and Gramps. Of course, many thanks to the
Mac Mozilla community.
