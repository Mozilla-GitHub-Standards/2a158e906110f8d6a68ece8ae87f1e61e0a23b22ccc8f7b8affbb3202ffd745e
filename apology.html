    <h1>Mozilla Apologator</h1>

    <address>
        by <a href="mailto:mtoy@netscape.com">Michael Toy</a>
    </address>

    <p class="note">This is probably more therapeutic for me than it is
    useful for anyone on the net. I'm still writing because I'd
    like to at least be able to point people at this document than
    to have to keep saying the same things over and over
    again.</p>

    <h2>The Bug Count</h2>

    <p>The Mozilla software, as it shipped on free-source day, has
    many many bugs. We made the decision to release the source just
    as we were approaching the drive towards beta 1 of the 5.0
    product, so this set of features has not yet been through the
    intense process of making it ready for the general public. We
    decided not to wait, that it was important to move over to a
    net-based development model as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Our goal was for 5.0 to be a high quality release, and it is
    a little disappointing that we didn't get a chance to redeem
    ourselves after doing 4.0, which we allowed out of the building
    with more bugs than we should have (but you never heard that
    from me.) We lose a chance for personal redemption, but the net
    wins, because the 5.0 that the net works on will be even more
    stable than we could have made it ourselves.</p>

    <h2>You may ask yourself, <q>How did I get here?</q></h2>

    <p>Mozilla 1.0 was a "clean slate" project, and a serious
    attempt was made to design this piece of software in a way that
    would avoid many of the problems experienced in the development
    and maintenance of Mosaic. It was also developed from 0 lines
    of code to shipping product in seven months. These two items
    are somewhat in conflict. Since then we have lived under the
    philosophy that since the Internet universe is changing daily,
    the most important thing was to put technology in the hands of
    users as quickly as possible, and to worry about refining
    things later.</p>

    <p>In the face of great pressure to ship quickly, to make it
    work for people, to add new features that initially seemed
    impossible to integrate, a strong pragmatic viewpoint took
    hold. If you read the code, some of it may not be pretty, but
    it does work.</p>

    <h2>You Are Doomed.</h2>

    <div>
        <p>In order to write successful code in the Mozilla
        codebase, you need to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Write code which compiles cleanly under many
            different compilers.</li>

            <li>Write code which runs on machines with 16-bit ints
            and 64-bit ints.</li>

            <li>Be careful not to write code which opens up a
            killer security hole.</li>

            <li>Understand the async-I/O-based flow of control and
            turn your pretty algorithms inside out so that the rest
            of the browser still works while your code runs.</li>

            <li>Know something about several different operating
            systems.</li>

            <li>Understand code written by several hundred people,
            with very little documentation or support.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>So you are completely doomed. But we've been doomed inside
    Netscape for years and it hasn't stopped us from shipping some
    very cool software. Don't let the fact that it is impossible
    stop you from doing cool stuff.</p>
