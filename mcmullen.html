<p><strong>Memorial Service for John</strong></p>

<p>Don Melton and I just visited with John's widow, Jane, and had
a good talk. She is bearing up well under the strain, and is
grateful for all of the attention she is receiving from family,
friends and co-workers. She has made arrangements for a memorial
service to be held at Spangler's Mortuary, 799 Castro St.,
Mountain View, California, on <b>Tuesday, June 29, at 4:00 PM</b>. She
hopes that those of us who knew John will come and talk about the
happy memories of good times we had with him. She also mentioned
that tulips were John's favorite flowers.</p>

<h3>Message from Bob Lisbonne </h3>

<p>From: Bob Lisbonne<br>

Date: Wed, 23 Jun 1999 16:58:28 -0700<br>
Subject: John McMullen </p>

<p>Folks, </p>

<p>Regrettably, we learned earlier today that John McMullen had
passed away. John was an engineer in CPD, and helped lead our
Macintosh development on Communicator 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0. Before
any of that, he earned a PhD in pure mathematics; lectured at
universities on three continents; learned French, German,
Italian, and Russian; and was an avid musician and composer. </p>

<p>Each of us will deal with this tragic loss in our own way. For
those who would appreciate the chance to talk about it with a
trained professional, I'd recommend contacting our Employee
Assistance Program at 888-265-1782. They are available 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week. </p>

<p>Netscape is doing all the right things, and is helping John's
wife make appropriate arrangements. As details become available,
they will be posted to http://www.mozilla.org/mcmullen.html. </p>

<p>I know that John's friends and colleagues send to his family
their condolences, thoughts, and prayers. We'll miss him. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>--Bob Lisbonne<br>
Sr VP, Client Products Development<br>
Netscape Communications<br>
