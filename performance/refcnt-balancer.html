  <h1>refcount balancer</h1>

  <address class="author">
    Contact: <a href="mailto:waterson@netscape.com">Chris Waterson</a>
    (waterson@netscape.com)
  </address>

  <h2>overview</h2>

  <p>One of the things that sucks about XPCOM is that you have to deal with
  reference counting. It's hard and prone to errors, and Mozilla leaks like a
  sieve because of it. Unlike the good old fashioned <code>malloc()</code> and
  <code>free()</code> model where memory gets allocated in exactly one place
  and freed in exactly one other place, reference counting is distributed all
  over. There may be twenty different spots in the code where a single object
  is <code>AddRef()</code>-ed. And if just one of those
  <code>AddRef()</code>-ers forgets to <code>Release()</code>, well, you're
  screwed.</p>

  <p>Traditional leak tracking tools like <a href=
  "http://www.rational.com/products/purify_unix/index.jtmpl?borschtid=30142038831761639304">
  Purify</a> don't help much either. They'll tell you that you leaked an
  object, but they won't help you track down the twenty different clients that
  <code>AddRef()</code>-ed it, let alone the joker that forgot to
  <code>Release()</code> it.</p>

  <p>This crude set of tools attempts to address that problem. It's not a
  panacea, but it at least gives some insight into who is
  <code>AddRef()</code>-ing whom.</p>

  <p>From 50,000 feet, here's what happens.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You discover that your <code>FooImpl</code> object is leaking, maybe
    Bruce Mitchener tells you, maybe you notice on your own because your
    destructor is never called. You cringe and moan and later the bug for 3 or
    4 milestones. But since you know about this tool, you eventually roll up
    your sleeves and start working on it.</li>

    <li>You set a couple of environment variables in a debug build.</li>

    <li>As you run, you notice piles and piles of information will start to
    spew out to the console. Specifically, as your object is
    <code>AddRef()</code>-ed and <code>Release()</code>-ed, a <em>stack
    trace</em> is generated, along with the operation (<strong>AddRef</strong>
    or <strong>Release</strong>), <code>this</code> (i.e., the object that just
    got operated on), and the current reference count of your object. This
    mountain of information, although impressive, is useless in its current
    form.</li>

    <li>You next run Perl script #1 over the resulting log file. This Perl
    script will pick out the instances of objects that leaked. You choose one
    of the objects that's particularly interesting to you.</li>

    <li>You now run Perl script #2 over the log file. This script is the Fancy
    Magic. It takes each stack trace and strings it together into a call graph.
    Each node in the graph represents a call site, and has a "balance factor"
    which is the total number of <code>AddRef()</code> operations that it has
    been included in <em>minus</em> the total number of <code>Release()</code>
    operations that it has been included in. (I told you it was Fancy
    Magic.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So what does all that mean? The cool part -- you were waiting for the cool
  part -- is that you can look at this graph and see what subtrees are
  "balanced"; i.e., total number of <code>AddRef()</code>s equals total number
  of <code>Release()</code>-es. You <em>know</em> you don't need to worry about
  those trees because no evil leakage happened there.</p>

  <p>For trees that are <em>out of balance</em>, you need to dig a little bit
  deeper. Subtrees get out of balance when one code path <code>AddRef()</code>s
  the object, and a code path somewhere else does the corresponding
  <code>Release()</code>.</p>

  <p>Like I said, it's not a panacea, but you can start to play Mah Jongg with
  the out-of-balance trees, proving to yourself in each case that the
  <code>AddRef()</code> from one tree matches with the <code>Release()</code>
  in another. In short, it does a decent job of directing you to the places you
  need to verify in your code.</p>

  <h2>Details</h2>

  <p><strong>Enabling Runtime Logging</strong>. You need to set a couple of
  runtime environment variable to produce output.</p>

  <h3>for Unix</h3>
  <pre class="code">
setenv XPCOM_MEM_REFCNT_LOG <em>log-file.dat</em>
setenv XPCOM_MEM_LOG_CLASSES <em>MyLeakyObjectImpl</em>
setenv XPCOM_MEM_LOG_OBJECTS <em>MyLeakyObjectSerialNumber</em> (optional)
</pre>

  <h3>for Windows</h3>
  <pre class="code">
set XPCOM_MEM_REFCNT_LOG=<em>log-file.dat</em>
set XPCOM_MEM_LOG_CLASSES=<em>MyLeakyObjectImpl</em>
set XPCOM_MEM_LOG_OBJECTS=<em>MyLeakyObjectSerialNumber</em> (optional)
</pre>

  <h3>for Mac</h3>

  <p>Create a file called <code>environment</code> in the directory where the
  <code>MozillaDebug</code> binary sits containing the lines</p>
  <pre class="code">
XPCOM_MEM_REFCNT_LOG=<em>log-file.dat</em>
XPCOM_MEM_LOG_CLASSES=<em>MyLeakyObjectImpl</em>
XPCOM_MEM_LOG_OBJECTS=<em>MyLeakyObjectSerialNumber</em> (optional)
</pre>

  <p>(Note that case <em>is</em> important.) These variables are described in
  more detail in the <a href="../projects/xpcom/MemoryTools.html">Memory
  Tools</a> documentation.</p>

  <p>Now when you run, you should see lots of information dumped to your
  <code>log-file.dat</code> (which defaults to the console, if not set).
  Specifically, each time an object is <code>AddRef()</code>-ed and
  <code>Release()</code>-ed, several lines will get added to the file. So make
  sure you have plenty of disk space.</p>

  <p><strong>Postprocessing Step 1: Finding the Leakers</strong>. First you
  have to figure out which objects leaked. There's a Perl script that does
  this. It grovels through the log file, and figures out which objects got
  allocated (it knows because they were just allocated because they got
  <code>AddRef()</code>-ed and their refcount became <strong>1</strong>). It
  adds them to a list. When it finds an object that got freed (it knows because
  its refcount goes to <strong>0</strong>), it removes it from the list.
  Anything left over is leaked.</p>

  <p>The script is called <a href=
  "http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/tools/rb/find-leakers.pl"><code>find-leakers.pl</code></a>.
  So, depending on your platform, do something like:</p>
  <pre class="code">
% perl -w find-leakers.pl my-leaks.log
</pre>

  <p>(Replace <code>my-leaks.log</code> with your logfile.) This will print out
  a list of pointers:</p>
  <pre class="code">
0x00253ab0 (1)
0x00253ae0 (2)
0x00253bd0 (4)
</pre>

  <p>The number in parenthesis is the order in which it was allocated, if you
  care. Pick one for use with Step 2.</p>

  <p><strong>Postprocessing Step 2: Building the Balance Tree</strong>. Now
  that you've picked an object that leaked, you can build a "balance tree"
  (anyone who can think of a better name feel free to let me know). This
  process takes all the stack <code>AddRef()</code> and <code>Release()</code>
  stack traces and munges them into a call graph. Each node in the graph
  represents a call site. Each call site has a "balance factor", which is
  positive if more <code>AddRef()</code>s than <code>Release()</code>-es have
  happened at the site, zero if the number of <code>AddRef()</code>s and
  <code>Release()</code>-es are equal, and negative if more
  <code>Release()</code>-es than <code>AddRef()</code>s have happened at the
  site.</p>

  <p>To build the balance tree, run <a href=
  "http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/tools/rb/make-tree.pl"><code>make-tree.pl</code></a>;
  e.g.,</p>
  <pre class="code">
% perl -w make-tree.pl --object 0x00253ab0 &lt; my-leak.log
</pre>

  <p>Note that you specify the object that you want <code>make-tree.pl</code>
  to examine. This will build an indented tree that looks something like this
  (except probably a lot larger and leafier):</p>
  <pre class="code">
.root: bal=1
  main: bal=1
    DoSomethingWithFooAndReturnItToo: bal=2
      NS_NewFoo: bal=1
</pre>

  <p>Let's pretend in our toy example that <code>NS_NewFoo()</code> is a
  factory method that makes a new foo and returns it.
  <code>DoSomethingWithFooAndReturnItToo()</code> is a method that munges the
  foo before returning it to <code>main()</code>, the main program.</p>

  <p>What this little tree is telling you is that you leak <em>one
  refcount</em> overall on object <code>0x00253ab0</code>. But, more
  specifically, it shows you that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>NS_NewFoo()</code> "leaks" a refcount. This is probably "okay"
    because it's a factory method that creates an <code>AddRef()</code>-ed
    object.</li>

    <li><code>DoSomethingWithFooAndReturnItToo()</code> leaks <em>two</em>
    refcounts. Hmm...this probably isn't okay, especially because...</li>

    <li><code>main()</code> is back down to leaking <em>one</em> refcount.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So from this, we can deduce that <code>main()</code> is correctly
  releasing the refcount that it got on the object returned from
  DoSomethingWithFooAndReturnItToo(), so the leak <em>must</em> be somewhere in
  that function.</p>

  <p>So now say we go fix the leak in
  <code>DoSomethingWithFooAndReturnItToo()</code>, re-run our trace, grovel
  through the log "by hand" to find the object that corresponds to
  <code>0x00253ab0</code> in the new run, and run <code>make-tree.pl</code>.
  What we'd hope to see is a tree that looks like:</p>
  <pre class="code">
.root: bal=0
  main: bal=0
    DoSomethingWithFooAndReturnItToo: bal=1
      NS_NewFoo: bal=1
</pre>

  <p>That is, <code>NS_NewFoo()</code> "leaks" a single reference count; this
  leak is "inherited" by <code>DoSomethingWithFooAndReturnItToo()</code>; but
  is finally balanced by a <code>Release()</code> in <code>main()</code>.</p>

  <h2>Hints</h2>

  <p>Clearly, this is an iterative and analytical process. Maybe somebody
  smarter than me can figure out ways to automate parts of it. To date, I've
  figured out some tricks.</p>

  <p><strong>Ignoring balanced trees</strong>. The <code>make-tree.pl</code>
  script accepts an option <code>--ignore-balanced</code>, which tells it
  <em>not</em> to bother printing out the children of a node whose balance
  factor is zero. This can help remove some of the clutter from an otherwise
  noisy tree.</p>

  <p><strong>Playing Mah Jongg</strong>. An unbalanced tree is not necessarily
  an evil thing. More likely, it indicates that one <code>AddRef()</code> is
  cancelled by another <code>Release()</code> somewhere else in the code. So
  the game is to try to match them with one another.</p>

  <p><strong>Excluding Functions</strong> To aid in this process, you can
  create an "excludes file", that lists the name of functions that you want to
  exclude from the tree building process (presumably because you've matched
  them). <code>make-tree.pl</code> accepts the option <code>--exlude
  [file]</code>, where <code>[file]</code> is a newline-separated list of
  function names that will be <em>excluded</em> from consideration while
  building the tree. Specifically, any call stack that contains that call site
  will not contribute to the computation of balance factors in the tree.</p>

  <h2>pricing &amp; availability</h2>

  <p>As of this writing, the stack tracing code is implemented for Win32 and
  i386 Linux (compiled with <code>egcs</code> and glibc 2.0 and 2.1).
  Dontations gladly accepted; Bourbon preferred over other currencies.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/tools/rb/">Perl
  scripts</a>, available by checking out tools/rb, require only Larry Wall's
  finest (5.00504 seems to work for me).</p>

  <h2>credits</h2>

  <p>I stole the stack walking code from <a href=
  "mailto:kipp@netscape.com">Kipp Hickman</a> and Matt Pietrek (see <a href=
  "http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0597/hood0597.aspx">this article</a>). For
  Linux, <a href="mailto:shaver@netscape.com">Mike Shaver</a>, <a href=
  "mailto:bruce@cybersight.com">Bruce Mitchener</a>, and <a href=
  "mailto:ramiro@netscape.com">Ramiro Estrugo</a>. all helped me get things
  right. Mucho gusto. <a href="mailto:waldemar@netscape.com">Waldemar
  Horwat</a> and <a href="mailto:jar@netscape.com">Jim Roskind</a> helped to
  improve the post-processing scripts.</p>
