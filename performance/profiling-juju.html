<h1>Performance: profiling juju</h1>

<address class="author">Contact: <a href="mailto:waterson@netscape.com">Chris Waterson</a> (waterson@netscape.com)</address>

<p>This page contains tricks and tips for the black art of Profiling
Mozilla. For information about the tools that are available for
profiling, please see <a href="tools.html">this page</a>.</p>

<h2>Quantify</h2>

<p>Rational Software's
<a href="http://www.rational.com/products/quantify/index.jtmpl?borschtid=30142038831761639304">Quantify</a>
product can be a truly wonderful tool to work with. If you can get it
to work.</p>

<h3>Collecting Data</h3>

<p>Collecting data is actually the "riskiest" part. Mozilla is,
unfortunately, a big 500 pound gorilla of a product to profile, and it
really pushes Quantify to its limits. Here is the magic recipe that
I've used to get traces out of the tool on Win32.</p>

<p><b>Have lots of swap space</b>. Configure your machine so that you've
got a <em>ton</em> of swap space. (I've heard reports of needing as
much as 3,000MB -- that's three gigabytes, baby!)</p>

<p><b>Build with <code>MOZ_DEBUG_SYMBOLS=1</code> set and 
<code>--enable-optimize --disable-debug --enable-quantify</code></b>. 
Rule Number One in profiling is to <em>profile what you'll
ship</em>. Profiling debug bits means you'll fight with
<code>sprintf()</code> calls that generate debugging strings that go
nowhere, sloppy (but quickly) generated code from the compiler, and
all the <code>#ifdef DEBUG</code> cruft that people have left in to
verify internal structures. In other words, you'll risk spending the
afternoon chasing down a "big win", only to discover somebody's sanity
checking code is really, really slow.</p>

<p><b>Build in a separate tree</b>. Don't combine debug and optimized
bits in the same tree. Doing so risks the anger of the profiling gods.</p>

<p><b>Run the app once before starting to profile</b>. After a clean
build, you should run the app once to let XPCOM autoregistration and
other "first time" tasks take place; e.g., selecting the default
profile. (Unless, of course, your goal is to profile these "first
time" tasks.)</p>

<p><b>Use "function level timing" for a module that Quantify can't
instrument</b>. By default, Quantify will try to instrument each DLL
using <em>line-level</em> instrumentation. This is the most accurate;
however, sometimes (when appropriate chickens have not been
sacrificed), doing line-level instrumentation will cause the target
app to crash. If this happens, try changing the instrumentation for
the module that was being instrumented when the crash occurred to
<em>function-level</em>. To do this:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Click the <b>Setting...</b> button in the <b>Run Program</b>
dialog. This will bring up the <b>Program Settings</b> dialog.</li>
 <li>Click the <b>Modules...</b> button in the <b>Program Settings</b>
dialog. This will bring up the <b>Module Instrumentation</b> dialog.</li>
 <li>Find the module that was being instrumented when the crash occurred,
and change its <b>Measurement</b> from <b>Default</b> to
<b>Function</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Tip o' the hat to kipp for that trick.)</p>

<p><b>Remove all the files from your Quantify cache directory</b> if the
above doesn't seem to work. (This is what the tech support people at
Rational say, anyway.) I think maybe this has worked for me. Or maybe
it was because I did it under the light of a full moon...</p>

<p><b>"Pause" recording of data until you get to the task you want to
profile</b>. You do this by clicking the little "VCR pause" button in
the toolbar, and then clicking the "Rewind" button to clear out any
partially-collected results. Get the app to a state where you are
<em>just about</em> to perform the task you want to profile, then
"un-pause" the data recorder, perform the task, re-pause the recorder,
and shut the app down cleanly. Besides avoiding a <em>ton</em> of
unnecessary cruft, you will greatly increase the chances that Quantify
will actually be able to parse the collected data set.</p>

<h3>Analyzing Data</h3>

<p>Once you've collected the data, you'll quickly find yourself weeding
through more information than you probably care to know. Here are some
tips for isolating the stuff that's important.</p>

<p><b>Plan to take notes</b>. As you start to walk through this data,
you'll stumble on <em>dozens</em> of things that surprise you. Rather
than trying to address each individually, <em>take notes</em> so you
can come back to stuff.</p>

<p><b>Focus on the thread that did the work when analyzing the
data</b>. Quantify will collect timing information from <em>all</em>
the threads that ran during your task, and will include "dead time"
spent waiting in Necko threads even if you didn't happen to load
anything. Wading through that just makes your life harder. Start by
finding the "green thread" (i.e., the thread that did all the work),
and then use the <b>Call Graph</b> window and the right-mouse to
<b>Focus on Subtree</b>. I've found it <em>amazingly</em> useful to
recursively "focus down the tree" on hot operations.</p>

<p><b>Use the "Function List" to find hot function</b>. The function list
can be sorted by column, so you can find functions by name, function
time, and call count. The "function+descendant time" and "call count"
columns are most useful for finding the Big Kahunae of low hanging
fruit. Start there.</p>

<p><b>Use the "Function Detail" window to walk up and down call
chains</b>. The function list will give you a crude overview of where
time is being spent. But you know the code better than Quantify. Use
the function list (sorted alphabetically) to find key entry points
(e.g., where layout is starting, where a reflow is triggered), and
then switch to the function detail view to navigate up and down the
tree to see <em>who is calling it</em> and <em>who it calls</em>. You
may be surprised. Use the <b>Call Graph</b> window to re-focus on
subroutines if you become particularly interested in one place or
another.</p>

<p><b>Use call counts to identify opportunities for algorithmic
change</b>. A high call count may indicate an opportunity for
algorithmic change; e.g., replacing a list with a hashtable.</p>

<p><b>Use the "Annotated Source" to examine leaf-level functions</b> that
are taking a lot of time, or have high call counts. You can access
this menu by right-clicking in the <b>Function Detail</b> menu, choose
<b>Annotated Source</b> in the <b>Switch To</b> submenu.</p>

<p><b>Compare profiles against each other after optimizing</b>. Make sure
the performance optimization you <em>thought</em> you made actually
worked. Save the original profile as a baseline, and then refer back
to it as you tune the code. Not only will this keep you honest, it'll
give you bragging rights ("I made <code>foo()</code> go 200% faster!").</p>

<h2>Visual Studio 2005 Notes</h2>

<p>If you're attempting to use Quantify with Visual Studio 2005, you'll
need to be using version 7.0 of the Rational suite.  Data collection
with VS2005 built binaries seems to require much more profiling space
than previous required.  Discussion with Rational support gave these
steps to allow data collection, in addition to the normal Quantify
instructions above:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Enable 3GB mode in Windows.  Edit <code>boot.ini</code> and add
<code>/3GB</code> to the end of line in the <code>[operating systems]</code>
section. Reboot to make this take effect.</li>
 <li>Before you start a run, you need to add some quantify options:
 <ol>
  <li>In the <b>Run Program</b> dialog, click on <b>Settings...</b></li>
  <li>Click on the <b>Files</b> tab</li>
  <li>Add the following to <b>Additional options</b>:
<code>-large-address-aware=yes -map-entire-shared-mem-range=yes<br>
-runtime-data-size=0x3f000000</code></li>
 </ol>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>If you've already tried profiling before adding those options, make
sure Quantify reinstruments the EXE/DLLs by clearing the cache -
<b>Run Program</b>, click on <b>Settings...</b>, select the
<b>PowerTune</b> tab, click on <b>Configure...</b>, click on <b>Clear
Cache</b>.</p>

<h2>Mac Profiling Tips</h2>

<p>These courtesy
<a href="mailto:pierre@netscape.com">Pierre Saslawski</a> (pierre@netscape.com),
who posted them in
<a href="news://news.mozilla.org/37F0B9AE.AD60306%40netscape.com">this article</a>.
</p>

<h3>Resolving aliases is slow!</h3>

<p>Launching the app after restarting the Mac takes about 37 seconds with a
debug build with aliases and about 19 seconds with the real files.</p>

<p>It takes 4.5s to load the 43 DLLs instead of 3.06s, which means that
using aliases makes it 50% slower for relatively big files. It must be
worse for plenty of small files (like xpt, xul, gif...).</p>

<p>Result: if you are working on performance, you should use
a copy of the debug build with real files instead of aliases
otherwise you may not be able to appreciate your improvements to
their fullest.</p>

<h3>File cache makes a big difference</h3>

<p>With VM on and a cache of 8Mb, it takes 37 seconds to launch a debug
build with aliases. With a cache of 128Kb (the minimum allowed by MacOS),
it takes 1 minute and 5 seconds. The time needed to load just the DLLs
was 12 seconds instead of 4.5.</p>

<h3>Virtual Memory makes almost no difference</h3>

<p>Turning the Virtual Memory on and off, makes no difference at all
for launching the app for the first time: 37 seconds in both cases.
However, VM-on improves quite a bit the time needed to relaunch the
app just after a Quit: about 9 seconds instead of 12. Most of this
difference comes from the time needed to reload the DLLs: 0.8 seconds
in one case, 2.9 seconds in the other.</p>

<h3>Optimized builds are a little bit faster</h3>

<p>We suspected it, however the difference is not very important. I compared
a debug build without aliases and a daily build from Mozilla.org.
After restarting the Mac, the debug build takes about 19 seconds to
launch, the optimized build about 16 seconds. We have about the same
difference when relaunching the applications a second time: 12 seconds
versus 9. It can be explained by a smaller size of DLLs in optimized
builds rather than by a better code (but it is just my guess).</p>
