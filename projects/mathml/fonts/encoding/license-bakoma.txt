Hello Roger B. Sidje <rbs@maths.uq.edu.au>

It is important that `BaKoMa Fonts Collection' is general name
for a several font packs (distributions) with different quality 
and different licenses. In details see: 
   <ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/win32/bakoma/dst/fonts.html>

There are FREE font packs, such as:
   CTAN:fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma
   CTAN:fonts/cyrillic/cmcyr
   Fonts from these font packs may be redistributed without
   any limitations.

There are SHAREWARE font packs, such as distributed together
with BaKoMa TeX: CTAN:systems/win32/bakoma
   Redistribution of these fonts is available only together 
   with BaKoMa TeX. It is obvious from SHAREWARE LICENSE.
   
There are COMMERCIAL Font Packs (EC/TC and LH fonts in Type 1 fotn format)
   See: <ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/win32/bakoma/dst/prices.html>
   Redistribution of these fonts isn't available in any way.
   
In details about your message:

So, redistribution of fonts from FREE font packs is available.
Such redistribution of fonts from other font packs not available.

This situation is almost the same.
You may redistribute FREE font packs without any limitations.

About recent version. Recent version of fonts is available only 
with BaKoMa TeX. These fonts are covered by SHAREWARE license.
Please read license for BaKoMa TeX (CTAN:systems/win32/bakoma/dst/license.html)

It clearly permites redistribution of `BaKoMa TeX' on non-profitable CDs.
Situations with profitable CD's isn't obvious.
However, I always permite redistribution of BaKoMa TeX on any CDs.

Bye.
