<h2 align="center">Report on the International MathML and
Math on the Web Conference 2000</h2>

<h2>Report on the Conference</h2>

<p>
<img align="left" width="148" height="167" src="mathml-logo.gif"
alt="International MathML Conference 2000">
The first International MathML conference hosted by Wolfram Research took place
October 20 to 21 in the Grainger Library on the campus of the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The conference was sponsored by 
<a href="http://www.wolfram.com/">Wolfram Research</a>,
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>,
<a href="http://www.ams.org/">AMS</a>,
<a href="http://www.compaq.com/">Compaq</a>,
<a href="http://www.w3c.org/">W3C</a>,
<a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</a>,
<a href="http://www.maplesoft.com/">Waterloo Maple</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/">The University of Illinois</a>'
<a href="http://gateway.library.uiuc.edu/grainger/">Grainger Library</a>.
The conference was 
<a href="http://www.mathmlconference.org/info.html">chaired</a> by 
Neil Soiffer (Wolfram Research),
Patrick Ion (AMS/Mathematical Reviews),
Angel Diaz (IBM T. J. Watson Center).
</p>

alt="Attendance">
The conference attracted nearly 200 attendees, and this explains the loud applause
at the conference, as enjoyable presentations succeeded one after the other in 
plenary sessions--the default format used at the conference. Much appreciation was
felt towards Wolfram Research Inc for their capable logistic which contributed
in making this conference a resounding success.
</p>

<p>
A pre-conference tutorial on the MathML specification was held on
Thursday October 19 at Hawthorn Suites Hotel prior to the beginning of 
the conference the following day at the Grainger Library. One tutorial
session was initially planned and was sold-out. Another one had
to be undertaken in response to the high demand. Both sessions were conducted by
the W3C MathML WG member Douglas Lovell of IBM T. J. Watson Center, New York.
</p>

<p>
IBM chose to announce the release of V3.0 version of its 
<a href="http://www.software.ibm.com/techexplorer/">techexplorer</a> 
hypermedia browser at the conference and participants were all invited
on Friday at the IBM-sponsored celebration dinner! That day happened to be the
birthday of Angel Diaz (IBM/Techexplorer) and Irene Vatton (W3C/Amaya),
and they both managed to get the attendance to sing happy birthday for each
of them.
</p>

<p> The program of the conference initially consisted of an opening 
video address (by the Director of the W3C Tim Berners-Lee), two keynote 
addresses (the 
<a href="http://www.mathmlconference.org/Talks/Keynotes/sutor/">first</a>
by Robert Sutor of IBM and the
<a href="http://www.mathmlconference.org/Talks/Keynotes/sw/">second</a>
by Stephen Wolfram of Wofram Research Inc),  eighteen talks, one 
panel session, two courseware, and several demonstrations and poster 
sessions. All these events were carried out as intended except that only 
seventeen talks and one courseware were finally undertaken, for two 
presenters found themselves unable to attend. </p>

<p>
The themes covered at the conference were (in 
<a href="http://www.mathmlconference.org/schedule.html">chronological
order of presentation</a>):
MathML in Browsers,
Computing with MathML,
MathML and TeX,
Validating MathML,
Editing and Authoring MathML,
Case Studies, and
Representing Science.
There were two or three talks under each theme, and it is planned that
the slides of these talks will be made available on the 
<a href="http://www.mathmlconference.org/">conference website</a>
in the coming weeks.
Although it is neither realistic nor the ambition of this report to
detail the rich variety of subjects that were addressed in the talks, 
the reader might be interested in the surprising
<a href="http://www.mathmlconference.org/Talks/karleen">case study of the US
patent office</a> which is setting a trend that others might soon follow.
The patent office is taking the emerging XML/XHTML/MathML seriously, as
evidenced by the fact that it has adopted these formats for its database 
of patent submissions, with an average of 1,200 mathematical items (in
MathML of course) archived each week.</p>

<p>

250 complimentary Mozilla CDs were specifically made for the conference (containing 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/">M18 with 
MathML &amp; SVG</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/brownbag.html">brownbag
training videos</a>). With the prospect of riding the lizard
just a few clicks away, the batch of CDs disappeared like hot cakes
from the conference desk. 

Those who successfully jumped the two initiatory hurdles
(<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/fonts/">fonts</a> and the
"riddle" of the .xml extension) were rumored to have enjoyed
their experience. So much so that one independent presenter even opted
for a live demo of his MathML with his brand new copy of Mozilla (a 
Work In Progress (WIP) with risks, remember). And when the splash
screen appeared on the projector with the magnified firing lizard,
the attendance cheered spontaneously. 

Speaking of fonts, the exciting news to share is that
<a href="http://www.wolfram.com/">Wolfram Research</a> and
<a href="http://www.mathtype.com/support/licenses/fontlic.stm">Design Science</a>
have finally agreed to relax their licensing restrictions
for Mozilla, and this means that bundling and auto-installing crucial
MathML fonts can become an item in the design and implementation of
the Mozilla MathML component.

<h2>Echo from Champaign...</h2>

Since it is intended that MathML snippets will be sprinkled throughout
larger documents (such as XHTML) which are typically aimed at browsers,
it was therefore no surprise that conference attendees were eager to know how the
implementation of MathML is coming along inside the major browsers. Consequently,
the theme "MathML in Browsers" was a hot topic at the conference, and
probably making the topic even hotter was the fact that the two talks
under this theme were 
<a href="http://www.mathmlconference.org/Talks/massy/">MathML
in Internet Explorer</a> and
<a href="http://www.mathmlconference.org/Talks/sidje/">MathML
in Mozilla</a>. So what is going on then, you might also ask, and
what about the browser-editor Amaya. Below is a perspective on the story.

<p>
It is good to first put things in context. 
IE may be a closed-source that sometimes curiously take a 
seemingly long time to resolve the DNS than to fetch a web page,
but since their rewrite in version 4 and their foundation laid there,
the IE team has implemented a few things that are just starting
to happen in Mozilla, and their layout engine has collected
a consistent number of positive reviews.
Therefore the question really was:
can that layout engine stand the torture of MathML?
The approach used in IE doesn't allow to answer the question, however.
Indeed MathML hasn't been made a built-in part of IE and the rendering
presented at the conference relied on Design Science's 
<a href="http://www.mathtype.com/company/press/releases/oct00.stm">MathPlayer 
plug-in</a>. The MathPlayer is a COM object specifically tuned for IE. 

It interacts through IE's layout APIs, and enough APIs were extended by the
IE team to allow proper spacing and baseline alignments--these are the critical
features that were lacking in earlier generations of plug-ins. As a result of
these join-forces, the rendering at defaut font-size looks quite good.
While this approach shows a great degree of extensibility of the layout engine,
and may have some merits especially for non-textual XML applications, the
approach suffers from some limitations that are not present in the Mozilla
approach--as far as MathML rendering is concerned. Also, because a plug-in
is a plug-in (at least in this generation), the users has to resort to the
&lt;object&gt; tag, which precludes fine-grain operations down to leaf nodes
within the math container.
</p>

<p>
It should be recalled that some of the strengths of the Mozilla approach 
are: a cross-platform rendering with an input in standards XHTML+MathML
with namespace support, the ability to style the MathML with standards CSS, 
the ability to interact with the MathML, e.g., searching for the 'cos'
function in formulas by just doing Edit -&gt; Find [cos], re-sizing the entire
document along with formulas by just visiting View -&gt; TextSize (this
last feature proved  particularly useful to zoom the Mozilla presentation
on the projector). 
Of course, Mozilla has its share of weaknesses which are not necessary
to repeat here. Remember to use
<a href="../../../quality/help/bugzilla-helper.html">bugzilla</a>
to investigate any problems that you might encounter.
Maybe by the time these are fixed, the IE team would have fixed theirs,
enabling scientists and web-authors to expect that their standards compliant
MathML will "just work" in their favorite browser, whichever it is,
hopefully Mozilla...
</p>

<p>
While many see
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/MathExamples.html">Amaya</a> 
as an underdog amongst browsers, it is generally
said to shine on its editing capabilities. In particular,
its standards compliant XTHML+MathML output should in
principle be suitable for rendering in Mozilla. 
The version demonstrated at the conference included editing of MathML
as well as some WIP on editing SVG. It was impressive
to see live editing of mixed MathML and SVG through the so-called
"structure view" (or the DOMviewer in Mozilla's terminology).
Changes in the structure view were reflected in the content window
in real-time and vice-versa.
Evaluating this mode when attacking the editing aspect of 
the Mozilla MathML project might provide some insights into this much
<a href="http://www.mathmlconference.org/Talks/miner/">needed aspect</a>
on mainstream browsers.
