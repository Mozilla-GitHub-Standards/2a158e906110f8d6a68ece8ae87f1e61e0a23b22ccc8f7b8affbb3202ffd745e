 <h1>What's going on with Thunderbird?</h1>
 <p class="note">Recent changes can be found <a href="changes.html">elsewhere</a>.
 <h2>September 11th</h2>
 <p>0.3 will be based off of the MOZILLA_1_5_BRANCH. 0.4a is now the open Mozilla 1.6a trunk. I will be updating the roadmap to reflect this shortly.
  I branched mozilla/mail with a MOZILLA_1_5_BRANCH tag to match the main trunk. Once Mozilla is just about done with their 1.5 branch, I'll then create 
  a brand new THUNDERBIRD_0_3_BRANCH based on the 1.5 final branch for final 0.3 bits. Any comments in this log that refer to TRUNK mean the 0.4a builds. Any
  change that refers to BRANCH means the 0.3a builds. 
 <p>Worked on improving the spell checker today. I fixed Bug #216235: spell checker should not spell check the reply prefix text (i.e. "John Doe wrote:") and
  made a change to prevent the spell checker from spell checking signatures. Port Neil's fix for Bug #180215 where the junk mail dialog can have a huge size.
  Port Neil's mozilla trunk fix for Bug #200656: MailAreaHasFocus() is no longer necessary. Bug #218024: Portions of View | Messages menu missing, 
  ported by Stephen Walker based on a patch by Neil for the mozilla trunk. Bug #87924 --> Search in subscribe should only begin after user stops typing,
  ported patch by Neil. 
 <h2>September 10th</h2>
 <p>Add minheight to address book panes. Patch by Stephen Walker.
 <h2>September 8th</h2>
 <p>Port Neil's fix for Bug #16967 which adds support for marking messages read by date. Take the fix for Bug #61520 into thunderbird: Add additional headers to every message.
 <h2>September 5th</h2>
 <p>Take Bug #130070: Add Mark All Read to the folder pane's context menu, thanks to Aidas Kasparas for the patch. Bug #218051: "Always use this Profile" doesn't work. 
  Thanks to mbr for the patch.
 <h2>September 3rd</h2>
 <p>Mozilla Thunderbird 0.2 is on the wire! Thanks for all the contributors that helped make this milestone possible! Read the 
  <a href="release-notes.html">Release Notes</a> for more information about 0.2.
 <h2>September 1st</h2>
 <p>Final bits for windows are done. One more respin for Mac and Linux. We are really close. 
 <h2>August 30th</h2>
 <p>Take bienvenu's fix for IMAP folders (e.g. Trash) will not work without trailing "/" in prefs on the branch (Bug #214962). 
 <h2>August 29th</h2>
 <p>Created THUNDERBIRD_0_2_BRANCH in CVS for the 0.2 milestone release. Took David Bienvenu's performance fix for moving messages
  marked as junk on the branch. Added code to do Netscape 4.x migration on first start up based on a hidden preference to the branch.
  Port fix to not spell check urls to the branch. Take Bug #215771 on the branch which caused focus to lock up in the mail compose auto complete widget.
  Bug #216581 --> fix rewrap in plain text compose on the branch. Fix Bug #217465 --> images were not loading in news messages.
  Take Bug #216753 on the branch, this changes how we handle background images in mail compose messages, preserving the background image when saving as draft
  and as a template. Also preserve the dir attribute on the message body when saving as draft / template for BIDI users. Change the branch user agent to 0.2.
  Make Find in message work on the branch. 
 <h2>August 25th</h2>
 <p>My hard drive decided to crash on August 20th, right after releasing the latest weekly build. I'm just now back on my feet again building and working
  on thunderbird. Sorry for the lack of feature work over the last couple of days!
 <p>Leverage toolkit/mozapps in thunderbird. This gives us a brand new open attachments dialog. We now have a new pref category called Attachments
  which lets you manage the apps behavior for opening attachments. Thanks to Ben Goodger for helping make this possible
 <p>Bug #214981 --> copy over the local specific .rdf files in defaults. This fixes the problem where
  we were not auto generating localstore.rdf in the profile like we should have.
 <p>Bug #217252 --> Contacts panel is double click trigger happy. Fix preferences bustage caused by some mozilla/toolkit changes. 
 <p>New thunderbird .ico file for windows which should look better on win2k than the current one. Thanks to Jason Kersey for the new file.
 <p>Bug #214864 --> Checkmark on "View|Toolbars|Mail Toolbar" is set when the Mail Toolbar is hidden
  thanks to mbr for helping out with the patch.
 <p>Land Bug #134492 which makes the mail client now print out a list of attachments went printing a mail message. Thanks to Kevin Teuscher for helping
  to drive this patch into the trunk.
 <h2>August 19th</h2>
 <p>When turning off the preview pane via the menu item make sure we really do stop loading messages in the preview pane.
  Bug #216725 --> add back mark as junk / mark as not junk to the Messages/ Mark menu.
  Bug #216359 --> search bar menu item does not stay unchecked in the address book because it is missing an id. Thanks to mbr for the patch.
 <p>Branding changes in the mail start page courtesty of David Tenser. Lose the "Mail" string in all of our windows simple mapi
  dialogs so the dialogs say "Mozilla Thunderbird" instead of Thunderbird Mail. 
 <p>Change the product vendor string from Thunderbird Mail to Mozilla Thunderbird. This effects the registry keys we set
  on windows. We'll now register Mozilla Thunderbird as a possible default mail application instead of Thunderbird Mail. 
 <p>Don't spell check urls inside of a mail message!
 <h2>August 18th</h2>
 <p>New windows desktop and window title icon courtesty of Jason Kersey.
 <h2>August 17th</h2>
 <p>Bug #116867 --> Convert background images from file urls to inline cid urls and attach the image as an inline part.This allows thunderbird and mozilla mail to support
  background images again.
  <br>Bug #170504 --> Compose from template/draft containing "Inline Styles" and a background image loses the background image drops the
  inline style.
 <h2>August 15th</h2>
 <p>Skin the address book sidebar header like the mail 3-pane along with some border cleanup. Thanks to Stephen Walker for the patch.
 <h2>August 14th</h2>
 <p>Bug #215901: formatting toolbar gets disabled in mail compose when selecting any drop down list. Port a missing style rule
  over from classic\global.css. 
 <h2>August 13th</h2>
 <p>Clean up the stand alone message window by hiding various separators and menu items that don't apply in this window. Port Bug #141531 to 
  thunderbird which moves the quote reply prefs from the options dialog to Account Settings / Composing. Thanks to Stephen Walker for porting 
  this to Thunderbird.
 <p>David Bienvenu checked in a fix for infamous <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211289">Bug #211289</a>, where various
  thread pane actions like emptying trash would leave a bunch of dots in the thread pane.
 <h2>August 12th</h2>
 <p>Land a new about dialog including a new background image. Thanks to Jason Kersey for helping me with the new image.
 <h2>August 11th</h2>
 <p>Make Go To Next Unread message cross folders for Thunderbird. Land a new junk mail icon for the thread and message panes. Thanks to Jason Kersey
  for hepling with the image. This image may stil be a work in progress. Update the locale to 1.5b. Add a View / Layout menu item which allows the user to set the desired mail 3-pane layout.
  Move the menu item for hiding the message pane from Toolbars (where it did not belong) down to the new Layout menu. Thanks to Stephen Walker for contributing
  this patch.
 <h2>August 9th</h2>
 <p>Mac OSX now has a new aqua looking application icon in the system dock. Thanks to Don Crandall for figuring out how to do this and for Jason Kersey
  who did the artwork. A patch from Stephen Walker to further clean up the advanced options panel. 
  Use -moz-image-region for window config instead of using separate icons for each window layout in the options / general panel.
 <h2>August 8th</h2>
 <p>Land Bienvenu's fix for <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214402">Bug #214402</a> for thunderbird. This allows the user to prevent
  the thread pane from loading until the user has logged in for that account. Rebuild the advanced preferences panel to better match with the new
  Firebird look, includes using the shared expander bindings in mozilla/toolkit. Expose preferences for controlling address book collection rules in 
  the advanced prefs panel. 
 <p>Make the options dialog resizeable! Align the language boxes in the fonts panel, thanks to Stephen Walker for the patch.
 <h2>August 7th</h2>
 <p>Remove the - Mozilla Thunderbird title text that we currently append to every message window. I actually spent some time contributing some work back
  to the Firebird team, namely adding Send Page / Send Link support to Mozilla Firebird: Bug #. Pushed a new windows build tonight. 
 <h2>August 3rd</h2>
 <p>Remove the Send Options pref component and make it a stand alone dialog invoked from the Composition options panel. Thanks to Stephen Walker for helping to drive this in. 
  Make the options dialog a little taller.
 <p>Land button icons for categories in the options dialog. Land update toolbar icons for mail compose and mail 3-pane. Thanks to Arvid for providing the updated
  artwork!!
 <p>Add a previous toolbar button to the mail window to complement the existing next button. This button goes to the previous unread message. Add a Quote button
  to mail compose which quotes the selected message. This matches Netscape 4.x parity. Both of these buttons are off by default and need to be added via
  View / Toolbars / Customize. 
 <p>Fix some regressions my fix for #213538 caused when trying to load account central.
 <h2>August 1st</h2>
 <p><a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213538">Bug #213538</a>:  remove a thunderbird specific hack in nsWebShell and re-implement it using
  a uri loader interface in nsMsgWindow. 
  <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214446">Bug #214446 </a>: fix duplicate mnemonic for rewrap menu item. Thanks to Malte Rucker for the fix
  Add customize toolbar context item to the menubar. Thanks to Stephen Walker for the patch.
 <h2>July 31st</h2>
 <p>Fix <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214687">Bug #214687</a>, show the account name in the identity menu list just like we show it
  in the menu list popup. 
  Created contrib and contrib-localized directories up on the download site for contributed builds. Also pushed german localized version of 0.1 on all three
  platforms. Thanks to diePause for contributing this localization!
 <h2>July 30th</h2>
 <p>Came up with a fix for the spell checker to keep us from spell checking plain text replies (<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201866">Bug #201866</a>!
  Will check this in pending code reviews. Checked in a fix for Stephen Walker which fixes the issue in the Fonts Pref panel where the font size menu lists were showing "..." instad of the font sizes
  (Bug #214544).
 <p>Fix <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214482">Bug #214482</a>, keyboard bindings are not working in the address book.
  Fix an issue where you could not sort by order received if you were clicking on the order received column header. When you drag attachments 
  over the addressing envelope in mail compose, pop open the attachment bucket.
 <h2>July 29th</h2>
 <p>David Bienvenu checked in a big memory leak fix (<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210985">Bug #210985</a>)  that was keeping dbs open.
  Fix a thunderbird specific crash in libmime (<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214336">Bug #214336</a>). Check in the fix for the infamous
  address book crash (<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213852">Bug #213852</a>). Fix the location of the about dialog on OSX. Thanks to Don
  Crandall for the fix. Clean up the address book card preview colors, plus some box clean up for the junk bar in the message window. Thanks Stephen Walker for those patches.
 <h2>July 27th</h2>
 <p>Been busy the last couple days getting our first 0.1 milestone release ready. This release is made from a snap shot of the Mozilla 1.5b Trunk. Wrote up
some <a href="release-notes.html">release notes</a>. Bumped the skin version for thunderbird themes. Finally found a fix for the address book crash
that had been lurking in the last couple of builds. Fix the font calibration dialog. Fix the HR properties dialog in editor (thanks to Stephen Walker for the patch).
David Bienvenu checked in a fix to enable the menu items for collapse/expand all threads which was previously disabled. Fixed a bug where mail compose 
toolbar buttons weren't showing text and icons by default. 
 <h2>July 23rd</h2>
 <p>Land new mail attachment display. If you want a large icon version of this, just set: mailnews.attachments.display.largeView to true in your prefs.js file.
Remaining issues: Implement drag and drop to the desktop so it actually saves the file (<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83803">Bug #83803</a>)
and add support for tabbing into the attachment list. 

<p>Fix problems with remembering the height of the message pane in the 3-pane. We weren't properly remembering where the user set the splitter for the 
height of the message pane. 

<p>Fix a regression where launching Thunderbird from the Win XP Start menu was causing a blank thread pane and no folder being selected at start up.
 <h2>July 22nd</h2>
 <p>Add support for managing stored mail passwords from Tools / Options / Advanced. Add back the View Messages in Original HTML / Simple HTML / plain text options as this seems to be really popular with our users. They shouldn't have to
get it from an extension. Checked in a patch from Ender which should fix the problem on Mac OSX where the menubar shows chinese characters. 
Checked in a patch from Stephen Walker to clean up the search bar borders.
 <h2>July 21st</h2>
 <p>Began working on an implementation of drag and drop that will let you drag attachments from the message pane to the desktop (or an OS folder). Still a couple
days away from being done. 
 <h2>July 20th</h2>
 <p>Even more work on the new attachment display widget. It is really coming along nicely and I hope to have it ready to go for the next Thunderbird build
this week! Just a little more polish =). If you have the hidden pref for showing the user agent string in the message pane (mailnews.headers.showUserAgent)
and the message does not have a user-agent header but it does have a x-mailer, then go ahead and set the x-mailer value on the user-agent field 
(<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=65472">Bug #65472</a>).
 <h2>July 19th</h2>
 <p>More work on new attachment display for thunderbird. See the <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=120298#120298">Mozilla Zine Posting</a> for where I am at. 
Check in Erik Arvidsson's patch to add atoms to the mail db view for replied and forwarded. This allows thunderbird themers to make thread pane icons
for showing whether a message has been replied or forwarded to (<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211795">Bug #211795</a>).
 <h2>July 16th</h2>
 <p>Pushed a new round of builds.
 <h2>July 14th</h2>
 <p>Make the verion string in the about dialog selectable (Thanks to Kevin for helping me out on this). Fix a crash in thunderbird
when viewing a message that tries to use a plugin via an object tag (<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212682">Bug #212682</a>
 <h2>July 13th</h2>
 <p><a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210984">Bug #210984</a>, allow extensions like enigmail to directly add account manager panels. 
Make thunderbird run with news & snews urls as arguments (i.e. -mail news://&lt;news sever&gt;). 

<p>Begin work on a new toolkit widget which will be used by a new mail attachments re-design. This widget will allow us to layout attachments
in a horizontal box which can then wrap lines. Write selection code for selecting individual attachments out of this widget. Implement key navigation
for navigating the attachment list using this widget. Hook up an expanded & a slim view of attachments. This work is not checked in yet. Still a work in progress.

 <h2>July 12th</h2>
 <p>Land a new 3-pane UI, which consists of 3 vertical panes (folder | thread pane | message pane). Land dynamic updating of the 3-pane UI. Change it in prefs
and we change the document model on the fly to create the correct 3-pane look. This will make code maintenance much easier as it obsoletes the alternate 3-pane
xul file. Thanks to Stephen Walker for helping me get this patch going in thunderbird. Note: known crasher with this change when you view a message with
attachments and then try to change the 3-pane layout: (<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212364">Bug #212364</a>)

 <h2>July 11th</h2>
 <p>Fix problems with the spell checker that had it spell checking quoted text for HTML mail (<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212469">Bug #212469</a>. 
Polish the certificate manager dialog to make it look cleaner (<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=212459">Bug #212459</a>.
Fix the issue where clicking on a mailto url in a browser when thunderbird was not already running caused an empty compose window to come up. We now
handle the mailto url properly. (This already worked if thunderbird was already running before you clicked on the url).
 <h2>July 10th</h2>
 <p>Add a customize toolbar button to the compose and address book toolbars. More overlay collapsing for the address book and mail view picker in the mail 3-pane.
Add chrome for manually calibrating the font size (Tools / Options / Fonts / Display Resolution / Other). Thanks to Stephen Walker for those fixes. 

Spent more time developing dynamic 3-pane configurations (<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105542">Bug #105542</a>).
 <h2>July 9th</h2>
 <p>Make a single uber drag and drop observer for the mail compose envelope. You can now drag and drop addresses, files, web pages, etc. anywhere in the envelope 
of the compose window and we will do the right thing (put addresses in the addressing widget, and the rest in the attachment bucket). 
Make the mail compose toolbar smarter: showing just text, icons or icons & text. Make the compose toolbar icons show up correctly in the customize toolbar
dialog. Move the themes and extensions categories in the options dialog down near the bottom of the list since they aren't as important as the mail specific
categories. Make the version string in the about thunderbird dialog be selectable.
 <h2>July 8th</h2>
 <p>Add access to the certificates manager to the smime security panel in the account manager. 
Add pref UI for dictating open message behavior (in an existing message window or in a new message window). 

More preferences re-organization work. Make sure we pre-select the correct button in the options dialog when opened for the first time. Fix some problems
with the font preferences panel where we weren't displaying the right language encodings for incoming and outgoing mail. 

Polish some of the account manager panels, reducing the amount of excess white space by using thin spacers 
instead of springs.
 <h2>July 5th</h2>
 <p>Yet another re-write of preferences. Re-factor several 'advanced' options into new homes away from advanced. Changes include: Moving all language settings to the Fonts/Languages panel.
Moving auto completion settings from advanced to Composition. Restore HTML color prefs to the display panel. 
Move Labels from advanced to the display panel. 

<p>Land new mail compose icons from Arvid. As part of that work, hook up small icons for the compose toolbar.
 <h2>July 1st</h2>
 <p>Reload the selected message if the user changes the junk status of the message to better integrate with the sanitization of html in messages marked as junk. 
Tweak the general prefs panel so we don't cut off content. Released a new windows build! 
 <h2>June 30th</h2>
 <p>Designed and implemented a Thunderbird content policy manager class. This class allows us to block remote images. Add UI to the advanced preferences panel
to support blocking of remote images. Make libmime smart enough to sanitize the HTML in messages marked as junk by default (<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=179568">Bug #179568</a>). 
Add UI to the junk mail controls dialog to allow the user to turn on / off sanitzing junk mail HTML. It is on by default. 

<p>Redesign the junk mail controls dialog. This is the first cut and it still needs some work. See <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/specs/junkmail/junkmail.html">Junk Mail Control Redesign</a> for more
details. 


<p>Make the junk bar in the message pane look much nicer than it currently does by using a color gradient back ground image. Thanks to kerz for the image.
Seth Spitzer just checked in a fix for <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211078">Bug #211078</a> which is going to make the mail compose
contacts list much more useful. No more entries in the address book with empty display names. I began implementing a thunderbird content policy manager
which will be used to block loading of remote images (yeah!). I'm hoping to hook up this content policy manager to prevent images from being downloaded
for messages identified as junk.
 <h2>June 29th</h2>
 <p>Picked up <a href="http://daniel.glazman.free.fr/weblog/newarchive/2003_06_22_glazblogarc.html#s96010222">Daniel Glazman's editor changes</a> for inline table editing controls. This is a really neat feature that makes it a lot easier to construct tables
in HTML mail. 
 <h2>June 27th</h2>
 <p>Remove some old version prefs for upgrading mozilla mail thread pane / address book pane UI that isn't relevant to Thunderbird. Thanks to Stephen
Walker for the patch. 
 <h2>June 26th</h2>
 <p>Make the contacts side bar panel open state persist across sessions. Hide the attachment bucket by default until you have
at least one attachment. Land Stephen Walker's patch to fork the tools menu icons. Add padding around attachment icons to make them look better.
 <h2>June 25th</h2>
 <p>Released a new windows build. Re-designed the layout for the new contacts sidebar in the compose window. Still playing around with the wording and text.
Major documentation updates for the <a href="roadmap.html">roadmap</a>, <a href="build.html">build instructions</a>, <a href="index.html">main project page</a>
and <a href="specs/extensions.html">extensions page</a>. They were all showing signs of cruft and being
outdated. 
 <h2>June 24th</h2>
 <p>Landed a first cut at a <a href="specs/images/abPicker.png">new address picker sidebar</a> for the compose window. You can drag, double click
or use the buttons to add addresses from your address book to the compose window via this sidebar. Hopefully it will make the addresses button
on the compose toolbar more useful and a more compelling experience than the old address picker dialog.
 <h2>June 22nd</h2>
 <p>Attempted to convert the way addresses are entered into the addressing widget to an Outlook styled text box. Ended up abandoning this attempt. At this
time our multi line text widgets will need a lot of XBL work before this will make sense.
 <h2>June 16th</h2>
 <p>Checked in the <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/nightly/extensions/offline/">official offline UI extension</a> to thunderbird. Wrote a user document about how to <a href ="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/specs/offline.html">use the offline extension</a>
Update the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/specs/extensions.html">Thunderbird Extensions</a> document to include more details about how to write an extension. More polish work on the extensions pref panel including support for the authURL attribute with extensions.. Collapsed the privacy pref panel into the advanced panel in order to reduce the overall number of
preference panels (which is still too high). Landed some changes to make the compose window support mailto urls. This should allow windows users
to click on a mailto url in browser and have it properly bring up a thunderbird compose window.
 <h2>June 15th</h2>
 <p>More polish work on the extensions UI. Turned the offline UI and preferences into an official Thunderbird extension. My hope is that this <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/mail/extensions/offline">extension</a> will serve as a template to be used by other extension authors. Hooked up
the settings button in the extension panel.
 <h2>June 14th</h2>
 <p>Add the ability to install extensions in Thunderbird via the extensions preferences panel. This feature will allow users to customize thunderbird to 
better meet there needs by installing various extensions to the feature set of thunderbird. See <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/specs/extensions.html">Thunderird Extensions</a>
for more details. 
 <h2>June 13th</h2>
 <p>Made the compose window understand how to handle mailto urls as a window argument. Why is this important? It fixes the bug in thunderbird where clicking on a mailto
link in a browser brings up a compose window without the address fields filled in! This can be tracked in <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209403">Bug #209403</a>. UI improvements
for the themes panel. Bump the product version string to 1.5a to match the mozilla trunk. 
 <h2>June 10th</h2>
 <p>Add the ability to install themes to Thunderbird via the themes preferences panel. This feature will be available in the next round of builds which will hopefully
be on the 11th. It will require some soon to be documented changes to how the JAR file for the theme is put together. More details to come tomorrow.
 <h2>June 7th</h2>
 <p>New preview image for the default theme that shows mail instead of browser. Change the locale version of thunderbird to 1.5a to match the trunk.
Hide a bunch of columns in the address book by default. Land some patches from Stephen Walker to remove some remaining references to grippies and to
remove a couple of unnecessary vboxes from the main 3-pane chrome. Land another patch from Stephen Walker which collapses folderPane.xul and threadPane.xul.
Should be another nice performance win.
 <h2>June 4th</h2>
 <p>Added some style rules to address book edit and new cards to make the caption tags look better when part of a tab widget. Temporary re-design
of the junk mail controls dialog to try to make it look more organized than the current dialog. More work from Stephen Walker to strip out
license information from chrome. Patch from Stephen Walker to get the Win XP looking file picker to come up.
 <h2>June 3rd</h2>
 <p>Patch from Stephen Walker to leverage the xul pre-processor by stripping away all of the licesne and copyright information from chrome files before
they go into the packaged jars. This should help reduce the overall size of thunderbird chrome. Collapse overlays in various address book dialogs, thanks
to Stephen Walker for the patch! Remove the MNG decoder from thunderbird builds, convert the MNG throbber to an animated gif (thanks to Pavlov for
providing the new gifs).
 <h2>June 2nd</h2>
 <p>Land a patch from Stephen Walker to package up all the files in res\Entities for the windows build instead of just html.properties. This will hopefully fix
some I18N issues rendering mail with certain charsets. Land the patch for <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201891">Bug #201891</a>
so you no longer need to apply this patch by hand before building thunderbird. This fixes an infinite loop in layout the first time you run thunderbird.
Add the ability to drop toolbar icons into the menubar since a lot of people want to be able to do this (I had intentionally removed this functionality).
Fix a JS error after customizing toolbars that was disabling menu items.
 <h2>May 30th</h2>
 <p>Add an about Mozilla Thunderbird dialog to the help menus in Thunderbird. Land several patches by Stephen Walker which collapse overlays for dtd, xul and CSS files for the address book and mail compose window. Many 
thanks to Stephen for this. Should give us a nice performance boost on new window time for these components. These changes will break external
themes in thunderbird though. Make the new icons show up in the customize toolbar dialog in the mail 3-pane. This means they won't show up for addressbook
and compose until those windows are converted over to the new theme.
 <h2>May 29th</h2>
 <p>Make toolbars for mail be large icons with text by default. Make the customize context menu show up in the mail 3-pane window. Don't include
commandglue.js in messenger.xul in order to avoid a JS error about a type being defined twice. Take a patch from Stephen Walker to remove all
occurrences of an empty overlay, communicatorOverlay.xul from the mail chrome. Hook up a context menu on the mail 3-pane toolbar for customizing
the toolbar like Firebird.
 <h2>May 25th</h2>
 <p>Added small icon support for the mail 3-pane. Landed Arvid's small icons for the 3-pane. Add support for showing / hiding text in the toolbar.
Added small throbber icon.
 <h2>May 24th</h2>
 <p>Landed Arvid's toolbar icons for the mail 3-pane window! Many thanks to Arvid for these great looking icons. Converted the address book directory
pane to use a sidebarheader as the column title (similar to the work already done to the folder pane). Land the animated throbber for the qute theme. 
You now need mng image decoders to build thunderbird. Removed the remaining branding references to Minotaur, replacing them with Thunderbird. 
 <h2>May 22nd</h2>
 <p>Reworked the folder pane, getting rid of the tree column title and replacing it with a sidebar title element ala firebird. If I like this change, I'm going
to repeat the process to the address book directory pane. 'Dummy proof' customizeable toolbars by not allowing the user to drag and drop icons into the menu bar in the mail 3-pane. 
Try out a new mail alert icon that Arvid created. Move my hack to get autocomplete working from a skin file, messengercompose.css to a ifdef in xul.css. Man,
the xul pre-processor rocks. 
 <h2>May 20th</h2>
 <p>More progress of the preference dialog overhaul. Collapsed more pref panels (addressing, return receipts, connections) into the advanced panel.
Developed an expander binding which looks like a collapsable groupbox which allows us to list a bunch of categories in the advanced panel. Looking to
land changes to build with the new toolkit now that all these preference changes are done tomorrow.
 <h2>May 19th</h2>
 <p>More toolkit work. Started compressing the number of pref categories we have to make the prefs panel look "neater" now that it uses the 
Firebird style look for prefs. Notification panel is now gone, it lives in the general mail pref category now. Collapsed both Labels and
Return Receipts into a single 'Advanced' pref panel. Temporarily threw the socks proxy pref controls into the Privacy panel until I can create
room for it somewhere else. This should allow uses who need proxy support to view HTML mail. 
 <h2>May 18th</h2>
 <p>More work on porting thunderbird to mozilla/toolkit. Landed all of the mozilla/mail specific changes. Have a small patch for mozilla/toolkit that I 
need to land before the conversion is done.
 <h2>May14th</h2>
 <p>Back from vacation. Landed patches to make thunderbird build using gtk2. Thanks to all of you who helped resolve the build problems for this. 
Add the thread menu item to the View menu which was accidentally dropped during a bad merge with the trunk. Synch up with all of the 
mozilla mail synch changes from the last week. 
 <h2>May 8th</h2>
 <p>Integrated the <a href="http://spellchecker.mozdev.org/"> MozDev SpellChecker</a> into thunderbird. We nowe have a spell checker! I have not landed
this onto the trunk yet, but it should be in the next thunderbird nightly build. Fixed the windows system tray biff icon so it shows up again. 
More work on customizing the compose toolbar to try to get that working again. Made the spell check button a default button in mail compose.
 <h2>May 7th</h2>
 <p>Removed pipnss and pippki jar files from the build, collapsing them into mail.jar. Fixed an ordering issue that caused the wrong DTD to be used
for the 'Toolbar' menu item under mail compose / View. 
 <h2>May 6th</h2>
 <p>Fix a regression that was preventing link hover information from showing up in the status bar. 
Fix the problem with an empty dialog being created in place of a helper app progress dialog. New windows build to incorporate
all the chrome fixes over the last two days. 
 <h2>May 5th</h2>
 <p>Fixed several regressions caused by recent footprint work. Include security dtd and properties files so security UI can come up. Make the find dialog
work again. Ditto for an issue with the View / Zoom / Other menu. 
 <h2>May 2nd</h2>
 <p>Chrome reduction changes are finally finished. There are now new packaging steps in mozilla/mail/config which unjar's all of our chrome files. We then manually
select each specific xul, dtd, css, .properties and image files that we need for thunderbird. These files are rebundled int: qute.jar (theme), mail.jar (all content), 
and en-US-mail.jar (locale). This allows us to leave behind all of the browser and
editor chrome which we don't need in thunderbird. Overall this effort shaved 300K off of the windows download size!
 <h2>April 23rd</h2>
 <p>New .mozconfig options for building Thunderbird are now available due to the landing of <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=191970">
Bug #191970</a>. See the build page for these. New default start page has landed courtesty of David Tenser. New windows snap shot has been released. 
 <h2>April 21st</h2>
 <p>This weekend was an extremely productive one for Thunderbird. We were able to shave almost 2 megabytes off our windows download size! Woo hoo. 
This was done by adding build options to build mailnews as a single dll <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=179533">Bug #179533</a> 
giving both a footprint and performance win. We added a Thunderbird specific packaging list in <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/mail/config">mail/config</a> 
so we can be more
selective about files get put into a thunderbird install. If you build on windows, look in mozilla/dist/thunderbird
for your thunderbird installation and NOT in mozilla/dist/bin. We copy just the files we need for thunderbird from mozilla/dist/bin into 
mozilla/dist/thunderbird. 
 <h2>April 16th</h2>
 <p>Picked up several trunk fixes including: Bug #77202 --> add an option to the account wizard
to download new pop messages after creation. For thunderbird, make sure new pop accounts default to leave on server for now.
Once we are a more mature app, we'll flip this default back again. 
 <h2>April 15th</h2>
 <p>Renamed the app to Thunderbird since that name cleared the trademark / copyright litmus tests. Branding changes. Synched up with 
the latest mozilla mail bug fixes (in particular, <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=143565">Bug #143565</a>).
 <h2>April 14th</h2>
 <p>Removed the Languages pref category, moving the appropriate prefs into "Compose" and "Message Display". If we hope to have a pref UI
that looks like Phoenix (with an icon for each pref category), we need to reduce the number of categories we currently have. Emptied out
tasksOverlay.xul since this overlay has been collapsed directly into appropriate chrome. 
 <h2>April 8th</h2>
 <p>Minotaur trunk builds now use a minotaur specific profile. No more cheating by using mozilla mail profiles. This means you will need 
to migrate your mozilla mail settings by hand if you want them to show up in minotaur. Will be releasing our first trunk version of minotaur
tonight. 
 <h2>April 7th</h2>
 <p><i>Trunk Work: </i>Landed core minotaur changes into <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/mail">mozilla/mail</a> getting us closer to building minotaur on the trunk. 
Bugs for the trunk landing are <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173084">Bug #173084</a> and 
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=194315">194315</a> Patches are in the review process and will hopefully land soon.

<p>Created a mail specific localstore.rdf for new minotaur profiles. Hide by default extra columns in the thread pane. I'd like to 
fix the height of the thread pane, the default size of the first window as well in this file but I haven't done that yet. I'd also
like to make the mail window be centered on the screen the first time the user brings it up instead of starting in the upper left 
corner. Make the address book a default toolbar button. 
 <h2>April 4th</h2>
 <p><i>Trunk Work:  </i>Moved all of the offline UI into offline specific overlays in mail/extensions/offline which is not built by default in minotaur. Once we have downloadable extensions hooked up,
offline users can grab this as an extension. For now, you can build mail/extensions/offline if you want offline support. This means
no more offline indicator in the status bar and no offline menu items under File. <i>To Do: Add a build config flag for building mail offline
support in minotaur</i>. Offline pref panel is now part of the offline extension package as well. Rename "Preferenes..." --> "Options...". Rename
"Mail & Newsgroup Account Settings..." --> "Account Settings...". Remove 'Reload' from the View menu. Move Prefs and Account setting menu items
over to Tools instead of under Edit to be consistent with Phoenix. Remove View Message Body As from the View menu. 
 <h2>April 3rd</h2>
 <p><i>Trunk Work:  </i> I'm doing and not the branch everyone is pulling. Added a menu item under help that points to 
the <a href="http://texturizer.net/thunderbird/">Minotaur Help site</a>. Hide the progress meter in the mail 3-pane if we aren't in the act of showing
progress. Remove the security icons from the status bar. Renamed "Loading Document" to "Loading Message" in the status bar. Hid the sort
indicator icon for the folder pane and the address book directory pane since these columns are not sortable. This makes the UI look a little
cleaner. 
 <h2>April 2nd</h2>
 <p>I'm continuing to make good progress rebuilding minotaur on the trunk. I'm just about ready to start generating patches for core mozilla
changes to support Minotaur builds (mostly build configuration changes).
 <h2>March 24th</h2>
 <p>You won't be seeing much progress over the next couple days on this page. But that's not because we aren't working
hard on Minotaur. I'm in the process of rebuilding the work we put into the MINOTAUR_0_1_BRANCH in the mozilla trunk.
I expect this to take 4 or 5 days and then I'll start landing it on the mozilla trunk. 
 <h2>March 19th</h2>
 <p>Back out the change to rename the executable to thunderbird until we know for sure that is going to be the approved name. 
 <h2>March 18th</h2>
 <p>Renamed the executable to thunderbird instead of minotaur. We may switch this back though. 
Add a help menu to the menubar. Add a release notes menu item which currently points to the default project page. Fix the width of the tree twisties. 
 <h2>March 17th</h2>
 <p>Take <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=191042">Bug #191042</a> and <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=194238">Bug #194238</a> 
from the trunk, both of these bug make some improvements to junk mail.
 <h2>March 14th</h2>
 <p>Build xpfe/components/find so find in message works. Make the default mail start page point to the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/minotaur/"> home page</a>.
Take <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193416">Bug 193416</a> from the trunk which was causing us to lose the pref for the default start page. 
 <h2>March 13th</h2>
 <p>The merge to the Mozilla 1.3 branch is now complete. Please note the new branch name: MINOTAUR_0_1_BRANCH. This was a big step for
getting Minotaur closer to a 0.1 release by moving to a more stable version of mozilla than our old branch.
 <h2>March 10th</h2>
 <p>The toolbar now looks like a Windows XP toolbar on Win XP (i.e. it has a color gradient to it now). Made classic the default theme.
Stopped using offline icons in the thread pane for classic, simplifying the look.  
 <h2>March 9th</h2>
 <p>Bryner landed Mach O build changes for the Mac! Fixed a problem with the customize toolbars dialog in the modern theme that caused the buttons to be inserted in the wrong order
when you dismissed the custom toolbar dialog. When you bring up preferences, we now select the right category in the pref tree. 
 <h2>March 8th</h2>
 <p>New open / close tree twisties for classic theme. Some account central clean up for classic to make it look better. Add a new atttribute for pref UI called:
prefinverted. This attribute can be applied to a checkbox when the pref is stored inverted from the UI (i.e. the pref is called disableFoo and the UI says "check
here to enable foo"). Fix some bugs in the new prefs UI by using this new attribute. 
 <h2>March 7th</h2>
 <p>Bryner landed build changes to get minotaur building on linux!
 <h2>March 6th</h2>
 <p>Remove tasksOverlay.xul/.dtd from the mailnews chrome. Remove mailTasksOverlay as well. Remove the Windows menu item, moving the items for 
mail and address book into the Tools menu. Remove the menubutton property from the Get Mail button so it no longer has the drop down list.
Add pref UI for controlling colors for html messages.
 <h2>March 5th</h2>
 <p>Major preferences re-architecture. Removed all non mail specific prefs. No more complex tree, now just a simple list of pref 
categories. Still need to hook up cert manager for security. Privacy
panel doesn't work yet either. Added a minotaur vendor string and substring to the user agent. Renamed Get Msgs button to Get Mail. 
Removed Switch Profiles from the Tools list. 
 <h2>March 3rd</h2>
 <p>Adjust client.mk so we pull the tagged versions of libpr0n and accessibility and not the trunk versions. 
Re-organized the Tools menu in the 3-pane, removing lots of excess cruft including the java console, web development menu item, and
the download manager. Stop loading editorTasksOverlay.xul. Remove navigator commands and keys from the tasks command/key set. 
 <h2>February 27th</h2>
 <p>Made the address book and mail compose toolbars customizeable. Renamed "Compose Msg" to "Write" in the mail-3pane toolbar. Added
a new address book icon to the 3-pane which you can add via the customize toolbar option. 
 <h2>February 25th</h2>
 <p>Ported over custom toolbars from the phoenix toolkit and adapted it to play nice with xpfe. Modified the mail 3-pane to work with
custom toolbars. Unfortunately there is a weird bug with the modern theme. After customizing a toolbar, the buttons are inserted in
reverse order. Work around: If you close and re-open the window, the toolbars show up in the correct order. Classic does not show
this problem. Removed toolbar grippies for a cleaner UI. Removed navigator and compose chrome from the prefs panel, still need prefs cleanup. 
Changed View / Toolbars menu items.
 <h2>February 21st</h2>
 <p>Bloat reduction. Don't build most of xpfe\components, portions of networking like ftp and view source. URI handling work to make sure
attachments and link clicks get kicked out to the default app. Branding changes. 
 <h2>February 20th</h2>
 <p>Config and build changes for building stand alone mail. Act like an XRE app.
