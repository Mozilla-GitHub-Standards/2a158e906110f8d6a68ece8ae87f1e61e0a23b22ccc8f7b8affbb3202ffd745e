<div align="center"><h1>A Look Ahead at Mozilla Thunderbird</h1></div>

<p>Happy New Year fellow Thunderbird users! In the spirit of the start of a 
new year, I want to talk about some of the plans and ideas we have for 
Thunderbird for 2004. Is this document a new <a href="roadmap.html">Thunderbird 
Roadmap</a>? Maybe, but the roadmap talks about specific milestones and 
schedules. I wanted to step away from that and focus on areas and trends we 
want to focus on over the coming year. Is this a comprehensive list? No, 
definitely not. Does this list have everyone's pet feature or wishlist item? 
No, I don't think I could fit all of those requests in this little document. 
And off course who knows what interesting developments may happen in the 
e-mail space which we will want to react to as well.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here is the list in no particular order.</p>

<h3>Thunderbird Installer</h3>
<p>We are long over due to leverage Ben Goodger's Installer work for Mozilla 
Firefox to develop a Mozilla Thunderbird Installer. Having an installer is 
critical for making it easy for new users to adopt or just try out 
Thunderbird. In addition to having the basic installer, we want to turn common 
extensions (specifically Offline support) into options in the installer UI. 
This would make upgrading releases with these extensions more robust as well.</p> 

<h3>Seamonkey Profile Migration</h3>
<p>Currently a user can migrate a profile by hand into Thunderbird from the 
Mozilla Application Suite. This just got a lot easier given the recent change
in Mozilla to use relative paths in the user prefs.js file. But we still need 
an automated migration path. A good migration solution would have two 
behaviors: (1) the ability to re-use an existing seamonkey profile in place 
and (2) the ability to do a full migration, copying all mail folders and data 
into the Thunderbird profile. The former makes it easy for users to use both 
Seamonkey and Thunderbird for reading mail without creating duplicate copies 
of their local mail stores. The latter makes more sense for users moving to 
Thunderbird from the suite.</p> 

<h3>Junk Mail Improvements</h3>
<p>We have made huge strides in developing our Bayesian based junk mail 
detection controls in the Mozilla Mail product line. However spammers continue 
to come up with different ways to bypass these controls. We need to continue 
to innovate in this space. Some of the ideas we'd like to work on include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improving the classification algorithm used for determining if a 
    message is junk.
    </li>
    
    <li>Support for server side junk controls. Many servers add headers to 
    incoming messages they think are junk. We should have the ability to 
    detect these headers, mark the message as junk on our end and follow the 
    user specified behavior for handling messages identified as Junk.
    </li>
    
    <li>Improve the rules for tokenizing a message before it goes into the 
    bayesian classifier. This will help give us better results.
    </li>
    
    <li>Limit the number of tokens we store in our training set. This will 
    help reduce the memory footprint of our junk controls and should yield a 
    small performance win as well.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Spell Checker</h3>
<p>Our spell checker is based on a two year old fork of the myspell engine 
used by Open Office. Since the fork was created, many improvements have gone 
into the Open Office version making it one of the best spell checkers on the 
web. It would be great if we could go back and merge those changes into our 
fork to bring us up to par with the behavior seen in the latest Open Office 
release.</p>

<h3>Support Multiple Identities Per Account</h3>
<p>Many of us have multiple email addresses which end up in the same mail 
account. Up until recently you could only have one identity associated with an 
email account. A crafty user, can now 
<a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=300933#300933">edit 
their prefs.js by hand</a> to associate multiple identities with a given 
account. We'll even be smart when replying to a message and pick the identity 
that the original author used when they sent it to you as the default identity 
in the compose window. However, we do not yet have a clean UI for creating and 
managing multiple identities for an account. The hard part for this will be 
designing a clean UI.</p>

<h3>Profile Portability / USB Devices</h3>
<p>This is more of a general Mozilla profile issue that Thunderbird could 
benefit from. There is a rising set of users that like to carry their 
application profiles around on USB key chain drives in order to achieve 
profile portability between machines. There are two classes of problems to be 
solved: (1) an install which works with a profile on a remote drive whose 
drive letter changes and (2) the app and the profile both live on the remote 
device.</p>

<h3>Talkback Integration</h3>
<p>Integrating Talkback technology into Mozilla Thunderbird for generating crash 
report data. Not that we ever crash of course!</p>

<h3>Multiple SMTP Server Overhaul</h3>
<p>We currently support multiple SMTP servers. However, the way we associate 
SMTP servers with accounts and how the user picks the outgoing SMTP server to 
use is a mess. We need to look at the issues involved with how we present and 
manage multiple SMTP servers to the user.</p>

<h3>RSS Feed Integration</h3>
<p>Integrate RSS Feeds into the mail window. Mail is a natural app for presenting RSS feeds. Let's take advantage of that.</p>

<h3>Add Grouping to the Message List Pane</h3>
<p>How about presenting a "history like" view of messages. For instance, when sorted by date,you have "Today's Messages". "Yesterday's Messages", etc.
When sorted by sender, "Mail from Scott", etc.</p>

<h3>Attachments</h3>
<p>The ability to strip attachments from messages. The ability to search for attachments based on content type or file name.</p>
