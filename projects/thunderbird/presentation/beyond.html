<h1 style="color: #009;">Looking Ahead</h1>

<p>Lots of interesting ideas to develop over the coming year. Need your help to make all this happen!

<ul>
  <li>Push towards becoming a PIM client via well integrated extensions:
    <ul>
      <li>Notes 
      <li>Tasks
      <li>Open Standards Based Calendar
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Spellchecker and the My Spell engine
  <li>Better attachment handling
  <li>Adding grouping to the thread pane
  <li>RSS Feed reader (Forumzilla)
</ul>

<p>As extensions mature and become popular, pull them into the main build.
