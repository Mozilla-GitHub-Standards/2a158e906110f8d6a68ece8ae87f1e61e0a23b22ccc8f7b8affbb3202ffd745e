    <p>
      Venkman is the code name for Mozilla's JavaScript debugger. If
      you're not already familiar with Venkman, you may want to read the
      the <a rel="contents" href="index.html">Venkman home page</a> first.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span style="color: red; background-color: white;">This document 
      describes how to use <strong>Venkman 0.8.6</strong> and earlier. If you
      are running one of the <strong>Venkman 0.9.x</strong> releases from the
      <a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/venkman/">development page</a>,
      you may find the

      <h3><a name="fnames">A Quick Note on Function Names</a></h3>

      <span class="floating-figure">
        <pre style="border: 1px black solid; text-align: left;">

 // this is a function named foo.
 function foo () {}

 // this is an anonymous function!
 var foo = function () {}

 var o = {
     // this is an anonymous function, too!
     foo: function () {},

     // but this is a function named bar_func 
     bar: function bar_func () {}
 };
        </pre>
        Figure 1<br>
        <small>
          Venkman will guess the intended names<br>
          for anonymous functions.
        </small>
      </span>

    <p>
      JavaScript allows programmers to declare functions without names. Keep in
      mind that simply assigning a function to a named variable does not
      name the function (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>.) While there is nothing 
      particularly <em>wrong</em> with anonymous functions, they of course,
      provide no name for the debugger to display. This can make debugging difficult 
      (imagine having to keep track of more than two stack frames named
      "anonymous".) Venkman will make an attempt to guess the <em>intended</em> 
      function names for anonymous functions. The situations illustrated in 
     <strong>Figure 1</strong> lead to easily guessed function names, but
      anything that deviates too much from those examples is likely to confuse
      Venkman. The method used to make the guess is somewhat simplistic, and can be
      easily fooled by unexpected comments, multiple assignments in one line,
      or multiple function definitions in one line. If you regularly declare your 
      functions in a format that does confuse Venkman, please file a bug.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Venkman <b>can</b> make a guess, the function name will appear in 
      square brackets.  When Venkman <b>can't</b> guess, the function name will be
      anonymous.  You'll likely see these square bracketed function names pop up
      in various places while using Venkman.
    </p>

    <p>
      Keep in mind that Venkman can only
      guess function names <b>after</b> it has seen the source.  You'll have to
      "visit" the file in the Source View for that to happen.  You can
      visit a file by clicking on the name of the file, or one of the
      functions contained by it, in the Script View.

    <h3><a name="overview">Overview of the User Interface</a></h3>

    <p>
    <span class="floating-figure">
      <a href="walkthrough-overview-large.gif"><img src="walkthrough-overview.gif" width="403" height="384" alt=""><br>
      The Venkman User Interface</a>
    </span>
      Venkman is both a graphic and a console debugger. Features such as
      breakpoint management, call stack inspection, and variable/object
      inspection are available from user interface elements <strong>and</strong> 
      console commands. The interactive console also allows for execution of 
      arbitrary JavaScript code. Venkman's keyboard shortcuts are the same as 
      leading visual debugging environments, and gdb users should be familiar 
      with Venkman's <kbd>break</kbd>, <kbd>step</kbd>, <kbd>next</kbd>, 
      <kbd>finish</kbd>, <kbd>frame</kbd> and <kbd>where</kbd> commands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Venkman consists of six main interface elements, which are
      (counter - clockwise, starting from the top) the
      <a href="#toolbar">Toolbar</a>,
      <a href="#project-view">Project View</a>,
      <a href="#script-view">Script View</a>,
      <a href="#stack-view">Stack View</a>,
      <a href="#console-view">Console View</a>, and
      <a href="#source-view">Source View</a>.
      Three of these views, the Project, Script, and Stack Views, are trees.
      As is customary with trees, any item with a ``twisty'' icon next to
      it (in the classic theme it's an image of + or -, in modern it's a
      little triangle) contains children.  Click on the twisty to open the item
      and display its children.  Click on the twisty a second time to close
      the item.
      <br><br><a href="#top">Back to top.</a>
    </p>

    <h3><a name="toolbar">The Toolbar</a></h3>

    <p><span class="left-floating-figure">
      <img src="walkthrough-toolbar.gif" width="442" height="80" alt=""><br>
      The Toolbar<br>
      <small>Quick access to basic functionality</small>
    </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The <em>Toolbar</em></strong> is located at the top of the screen. 
      The Toolbar contains icons for <strong>Stop</strong>, <strong>Continue</strong>, 
      <strong>Step Over</strong>, <strong>Step Into</strong> and 
      <strong>Step Out</strong> commands. These commands should be self explanatory,
      with the possible exception of Stop, which causes the debugger to stop
      when the next line of JavaScript is executed. When the X icon on the
      Stop button displays "...", as in <strong>Figure 2</strong>, the debugger will 
      stop at the next instruction. The stop state can be toggled at any time, and can 
      be used to cancel a single step operation which is waiting for code to run.
    <span class="floating-figure">
        <img src="stop-checked.png" width="32" height="32" alt="X..."><br>
        Figure 2<br>
        <small>Debugger will stop<br>
          when the next line is<br>
          executed.
        </small>
    </span>
    </p>
      
    <p>
      When the debugger is stopped, the Stop command will be disabled.  When
      not stopped, the Continue and Step commands will be disabled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Keyboard equivalents for these commands are listed in the 
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span>ebug menu.
      The console commands <kbd>cont</kbd>, <kbd>next</kbd>, <kbd>step</kbd>, and
      <kbd>finish</kbd> are equivalent to the Continue, Step Over, Step Into,
      and Step Out commands (as in gdb.)
      <br><br><a href="#top">Back to top.</a>
    </p>

    <h3><a name="project-view">The Project View</a></h3>

    <p>
      <strong>The <em>Project View</em></strong> is just under the toolbar, on 
      the left. At the time of this writing, the Project View only lists 
      breakpoints, and there is no way to save a project.
      <span class="floating-figure">
        <img src="walkthrough-project.gif" width="320" height="105" alt=""><br>
        The Project View<br>
        <small>Active breakpoints</small>
      </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Clicking on an item in the Breakpoints tree will navigate you to 
      the relevant source code. Breakpoint columns are <strong>File Name</strong>, 
      <strong>Line Number</strong>, <strong>Function Name</strong>, and 
      <strong>Matching Scripts</strong>. The number in the Matching Scripts 
      column indicates the number of functions that match the url and line number 
      for the breakpoint. If all files which contain a particular breakpoint are unloaded,
      the match count will go to zero but the breakpoint will remain. If
      the file is loaded again at a later time, the breakpoint will be reset.
    </p>

    <p>
      The console commands <kbd>break</kbd> and <kbd>fbreak</kbd> can be used
      to list breakpoints in the console. The <kbd>break</kbd> command (when used
      with no parameters) lists <strong>all</strong> current breakpoints, while
      the <kbd>fbreak</kbd> command (when used with no parameters) lists
      breakpoints which do not match any loaded files.  Breakpoints which
      do not match loaded files are known as <em>Future Breakpoints</em> because
      sometime in the future, when you load a matching file, a "real"
      breakpoint will be automatically set.  Read the
      <a href="#source-view">Source View</a> section for more information
      on <tt>break</tt> and <tt>fbreak</tt>.
      <br><br><a href="#top">Back to top.</a>
    </p>

    <h3><a name="script-view">The Script View</a></h3>

    <p>
    <span class="floating-figure">
      <img src="walkthrough-script.gif" width="301" height="222" alt=""><br>
      The Script View<br>
      <small>Active files and functions</small>
    </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The <em>Script View</em></strong> is on the left portion 
      of the window, in the middle. When a file is loaded by the browser 
      it will appear in this view, and when unloaded it will be removed. 
      Files are listed in alphabetical order, grouped by file type.
      File names are displayed after a color coded, single letter icon
      representing the file extension. <strong>Figure 3</strong> shows the 
      table of icon and file types. At the time if this writing, the order 
      and grouping of file names cannot be changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "special" function name <tt>__toplevel__</tt> is displayed for
      scripts that are not part of an actual function.
      Clicking on a file name brings you to the top of that file, while
      clicking on a function name brings you to the start of that function.
      <span class="left-floating-figure">
        <table class="figure-table">

    <p>
      The <b>Line</b> column in this view displays the line number that this
      function starts on.  The column
      picker for this view (the 
      <img src="colpicker.gif" width="17" height="19" alt=""> box on the top
      right) can be used to display a <strong>Length</strong> column. This column
      displays the size of functions, in lines. Both the Line and Length
      column are blank for file names.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can sort function names in alphabetical order, declaration order,
      or length, by clicking on the appropriate column name.  As usual,
      click on the column name a second time to reverse the search order.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a function has a breakpoint in it, a small red dot will show up
      in the function icon, as well as the parent's file icon.

    </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The <em>Stack View</em></strong> is on the left portion of the window, at the
      bottom. When the 
      debugger is stopped, the Stack View displays the list of active functions.
      The function at the top of the Stack View is the one in which
      the debugger stopped, the function below it is the caller, below that
      is the caller's caller, and so on.  These items are referred
      to as <em>stack frames</em>. Each stack frame contains a <tt>scope</tt>
      and a <tt>this</tt> object. The <tt>scope</tt> object holds all
      arguments and local variables for the stack frame.  The <tt>this</tt>
      object represents the value of the <tt>this</tt> keyword for the
      stack frame.

      Properties of both <tt>scope</tt> and <tt>this</tt> objects are

    <p>
      Properties which are of the type <tt>Object</tt> display
      {<i>CTorName</i>:<i>PropertyCount</i>} as their value.
      Where <i>CTorName</i> is the name of the function which constructed the 
      object and
      <i>PropertyCount</i> is the number of properties this object has.  Note
      that <i>PropertyCount</i> includes properties which are of type
      <tt>Function</tt>, which are not shown
      in the StackView.  (This is to conserve visual real estate in the tree
      widget, in the future there will likely be an option to list functions as
      well.)

    <p>
      The column
      picker for this view (the <img src="colpicker.gif" width="17" height="19" alt=""> box on the top
      right) can be used to display <strong>Type</strong> and <strong>Flags</strong> columns. The
      Type column contains a textual description of the type of the object.
      Flags lists one or more applicable flags for this object. Flags are

      For some objects, the magic property
      <tt>[[Parent]]</tt> and/or <tt>[[Prototype]]</tt> may be listed.  These
      properties represent the JavaScript engine's notion of the parent and/or
      prototype of the object in question.
      As a general rule,
      to locate global variables, look at the <tt>[[Parent]]</tt> property
      of the <tt>scope</tt> object. See the
      <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/language/E262-2.pdf" type="application/pdf">ECMAScript
        specification</a>
      for more information on these magic properties.

      Clicking on a stack frame will display the top of the frame's function.
      Clicking on an object, on the other hand, will display the file and line
      that object was created on.

      If an item visible in the Stack View is modified via the Console View the

    <h3><a name="console-view">The Console View</a></h3>

    <span class="floating-figure">
      <img src="walkthrough-console.gif" width="400" height="275" alt=""><br>
      The Console View<br>
      <small>Command line interface to the debugger</small>
    </span>

    <p>
      <strong>The <em>Console View</em></strong> appears in the lower 
      right hand corner of the window. This view provides a command 
      line interface to the debugger. Commands are entered in the text 
      box, and responses are appended to the end of the output. Type 
      <kbd>commands</kbd> in the input area (the text box) to list all of 
      the commands available. The <kbd>help</kbd> command can be used to 
      get additional information about a specific command. For example, 
      type <kbd>help next</kbd> to see how to use the <tt>next</tt>
      command.
    </p>

    <p>
      The input area supports command history and tab-completion for
      command names. Command history remembers the last 20 commands entered.
      The up and down arrows can be used to revisit these previous commands.
      Tab completion allows the user to type the first portion of a command, and press tab
      twice to see possible completions. If only one
      command matches, it will be auto-completed on the first tab.

    <h3><a name="source-view">The Source View</a></h3>
    <span class="floating-figure">
      <img src="walkthrough-source.gif" width="403" height="324" alt=""><br>
      The Source View<br>
      <small>Source code, line numbers, and breakpoints</small>
    </span>

    <p>
      <strong>The <em>Source View</em></strong> is a read-only file viewer. Files and
      specific functions within them
      can be displayed by selecting the
      appropriate file or function name in the Script View.
    </p>

    <p>
      When script execution is interrupted by the debugger,
      the line of the file where the interruption occurred is automatically
      displayed in the
      Source View.  The line in question will be highlighted in yellow to make
      it easy to spot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clicking in the left margin of this view will set a breakpoint at that
      line. If the breakpoint is successfully set, the margin
      will show a red octagon, and both the Project View and Console View will
      provide feedback. The breakpoint can be cleared by clicking in the
      margin again (on the red octagon.)
      Breakpoints cannot be set on lines which do not contain executable code, 
      such as blank and comment lines.  For these lines, the Console View will
      display an error message explaining why the breakpoint could not be
      set.
    </p>

    <p>
      Breakpoints can also be set and cleared from the Console View, with
      the <kbd>break</kbd> and <kbd>fbreak</kbd> commands. The <kbd>break</kbd>
      command takes a file pattern and line number. Any loaded file which
      matches the file pattern, and contains an executable line at the requested
      line number will have a breakpoint set. If no loaded files match the
      file pattern or line number, an error message is printed to the console
      and the command fails. The <kbd>fbreak</kbd> command is identical, with the
      exception that if no files match the pattern or line, a "future breakpoint"
      is recorded. The next time a file is loaded that matches the pattern
      and line, a breakpoint will be set. In this way, <kbd>fbreak</kbd> allows
      one to set breakpoints in files that are not yet loaded, as well
      as set breakpoints that are triggered <em>when</em> a file is loaded.

    <p>
      The following procedure attempts to walk a user through a
      (contrived) sample debug session, in order to become familiar with
      the basic commands. The source code used in the sample is subject
      to change without notice, please bear this in mind when interpreting
      file names and line numbers.
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      1. Start Mozilla with the -venkman command line argument.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      The debugger must be started before the scripts it will debug.
      This limitation will either be fixed, or worked around at
      some later time. For the time being, the debugger needs to
      be started like this to debug browser chrome.
      <span class="floating-figure">
      <a href="td-1.gif"><img src="td-1-small.gif" width="310" height="304" alt=""></a><br>
      Step 2<br>
      <small>Start Venkman and launch a browser window.</small>
      </span>
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      Debugging JavaScript components presents yet another opportunity
      for scripts to be loaded before the debugger is initialized.
      Because component registration happens
      <strong>before</strong> command line processing, when a component changes
      it will be reloaded at registration time, and the debugger will
      not see it. At this time, the only workaround is to start the
      browser twice; once to re-register the modified component, and once
      to debug it.
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      2. Launch a browser window
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      Select "Navigator" from the debugger's 
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">T</span>asks menu.
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      3. Type "break ContextMenu 357" in the debugger.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      The console command "break" is used to set and list breakpoints.  The 
      first parameter is the file name that contains the JavaScript you
      want to break at. The second parameter is the line number.  You
      don't need to specify the entire file name.  In this example, we
      are setting a breakpoint in the function called when the browser
      wants to create a context menu for web content.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      Alternately, one could select nsContextMenu.js from the Scripts View,
      locate line 357, and click in the left margin. Setting breakpoints
      in this manner is equivalent to using the <strong>break</strong> command in the
      console.

      <span class="floating-figure">
        <a href="td-3.gif"><img src="td-3-small.gif" width="373" height="304" alt=""></a><br>
        Step 4<br>
        <small>Set and list a breakpoint</small>
      </span>
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      4. Type "break" in the debugger.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      If you don't provide arguments to the "break" command, all
      breakpoints are listed.
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      5. Cause a context menu to be created in the Navigator window.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      Right click in the content area usually works.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      You should have hit the breakpoint you just set.  The debugger 
      should have displayed "Stopped for breakpoint", along with
      the file name, line number, and snippet source code from where
      it stopped.
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      6. Type "step" in the debugger.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      This executes the line of JavaScript we're stopped on, and stops
      again before the next line is executed.  The step command is also
      available via the "Step Into" button on the toolbar, and is
      bound to the F11 key.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      In addition to Step In, which will execute a single line of JavaScript
      and stop, Step Over can be used to step over a impending function call,
      and return control to the debugger when the call returns.  Step Out
      executes until the current function call exits.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      At this point, you should be at line 359, 
      <tt>this.onTextInput = this.isTargetATextBox(elem);</tt>.

      <span class="floating-figure">
        <a href="td-4.gif"><img src="td-4-small.gif" width="373" height="304" alt=""></a><br>
        Step 7<br>
        <small>Hit breakpoint, examine properties</small>
      </span>
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      7. Type "props this" in the debugger.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      The props command lists the properties of an object.  The
      letters and dashes before the values are the "flags" for that
      value. The flags are enumerated in <strong>Figure 4</strong>, above.
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      8. Step one more time.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      You should be in the <tt>isTargetATextBox</tt> function call now.
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      9. Type "frame" in the debugger.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      When used with no arguments, the "frame" command shows you the
      source code for the current frame, with a few lines of context.
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      10. Type "scope" in the debugger.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      The scope command lists the local variables for the current
      frame. In this case there are two locals, node and attrib.
      The <tt>node</tt> property is an argument to the function, while
      <tt>attrib</tt> is a local variable.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      The scope is also visible in the Stack View.  Open the
      <tt>[isTargetATextBox]</tt> frame, and the <tt>scope</tt> node below
      it.
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      11. Type "where" in the debugger.
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      The "where" command lists the current call stack.  The frame
      command can be used change the current frame to any of the
      frames listed here.  For example, to view variables in the code
      that called <tt>isTargetATextBox</tt>, type "frame 1", and "scope". To
      return to the top frame, type "frame 0".
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      12. Type "eval window._content"
      
      <span class="floating-figure">
        <a href="td-5.gif"><img src="td-5-small.gif" width="373" height="304" alt=""></a><br>
        Step 11<br>
        <small>Single step, examine scope and call stack.</small>
      </span>
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      The "eval" command evaluates arbitrary JavaScript in the current
      frame. Eval'ing window._content itself isn't very useful,
      you'll have to think up something more creative yourself.
    </p>
    
    <p class="what">
      13. Type "break"
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      The "break" command when used with no arguments lists the 
      current breakpoints by index.
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      14. Type "clear 0"
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      The "clear" command is used to clear breakpoints. In this
      example, we're clearing by breakpoint number, which we got from
      the "break" command in the step before this.
    </p>

    <p class="what">
      15. Type "cont"
    </p>

    <p class="why">
      The "cont" command is used to continue execution. The context
      menu should pop up just like it always does.
    </p>
