  <h1>XPCOM Component Reuse</h1>

  <address class="author">
    By <a href="mailto:dougt@netscape.com">Doug Turner</a>, and <a href=
    "mailto:jeev@netscape.com">Ellen Evans</a>
  </address>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>Historically if you were a developer who wanted to use some or all of the
  Mozilla codebase in your own application, you were required to download,
  build the entire Mozilla tree, and distribute your own copy of Mozilla. While
  this may have been tedious, it did guarentee that all the components that you
  acquired in this way were binarily and syntactically compatible.</p>

  <p>Now, however, there are two projects underway at mozilla.org designed to
  streamline the process through which Mozilla code can be acquired, built, and
  distributed to end users. On the one hand, mechanisms are being put together
  to make it possible to download and build limited subsets of the codebase
  instead of the entire tree. For more information on this effort, see <a href=
  "/projects/embedding/bootstrap.html">bootstrap.pl: Embed/REQUIRES-based build
  mechanism</a>.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, mechanisms are also being crafted to allow a single set
  of core components, the <a href="/projects/embedding/GRE.html">Gecko Runtime
  Environment</a> (formally MRE), stored in a central place on an end-user's
  machine, to be used as the support for any number of Gecko-based
  applications, shrinking application file size and simplifying user
  installation.</p>

  <p>As useful as these two projects undoubtedly will be, they do increase
  substantially the likelihood that components from different versions of
  Mozilla will at some point be required to interact with each other, raising
  significant issues of compatibility. The following notes are designed to help
  the developer who may be interested in taking advantage of this new,
  componetized Mozilla development environment to write code that is less
  likely to run into problems caused by version and/or compiler
  incompatibilties. If you are building an application that ships its own
  internal copy of all necessary Mozilla components, which have been built as a
  unit, these suggestions may be of less significance.</p>

  <p>The first and most important step you can take is to use, whenever
  possible, XPCOM interfaces instead of their supporting implemented classes.
  Because the codebase is open, and because there are a large number of
  seemingly useful classes already written and easily available (all you need
  to instantiate an object at runtime is an ID), the temptation to utilize
  those classes is great. But <em>no</em> implemented class in Mozilla is
  guarenteed to stay the same from one version to the next. A number of
  interfaces, on the other hand, <em>are</em> guarenteed not to change in the
  future. These are interfaces which have been marked @status FROZEN. By
  designing your code to use by strong preference only those interfaces which
  have been marked frozen, you increase considerably the chances that a
  component that you write today will be able to interact seamlessly with a
  component written six months from now. The public interfaces that have been
  frozen are listed in the <a href=
  "/projects/embedding/embedapiref/embedapi.html">Gecko Embedding API
  Reference</a>. So the best way to ensure continuing syntactic compatibility
  of components from one version to the next is to use only frozen interfaces.
  And because interfaces are, in essence, pure abstract classes, using them
  also promotes longterm binary compatibility.</p>

  <p>But even if you commit to using by strong preference interfaces that have
  been frozen, it is simply a fact that in <em>some</em> cases, you will need
  to do something which is not supported by a frozen interface. The code
  underlying nsCOMPtr, for example, is not frozen, but using this "smart
  pointer" is highly recommended, as it automates some of the more burdensome
  and error-prone aspects of COM reference counting. There are a number of
  XPCOM utility classes, such as nsDebug, that are also not represented through
  a frozen interface, but which are, nonetheless, close to being essential in
  many aspects of developing with Mozilla. The string classes also belong to
  this set of extremely useful but not frozen components. And you may find
  other examples for your particular situation. In these cases you have
  basically three options: you can simply manually copy the code into your own
  application; you can try to convince the Mozilla module owner that the
  functionality is of such widespread use that it should be exposed through a
  frozen interface (be aware, though, the process for arriving at the frozen
  state is often long and complex); or, in the case of the XPCOM utilities and
  the string classes, you can use a workaround employing special libraries that
  now exist in the code.</p>

  <h2>The "Glue" Library</h2>

  <p>The XPCOM "glue" library (<a href=
  "http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpcom/glue/">lxr</a>) is built as a
  normal part of XPCOM. But by linking a standalone version of this into your
  application or component, you, in essence, get a snapshot copy of this code.
  While it is a bit expensive in terms of footprint, it does allow you to work
  in any Mozilla 1.0 environment with confidence. If footprint is of concern,
  you can trim out the pieces that you do not need. The string library can and
  should be used in the same manner with the same caveats. The current string
  <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpcom/string/">code</a> is
  built without any dependencies on XPCOM. This means that it can be directly
  included into your component or embedding application.</p>

  <p><img src="glue.jpg" alt="The XPCOM glue code" height="334" width=
  "498"></p>

  <p>The glue library consists of commonly requested helper classes. Although
  this article isn't meant as a complete description of how to use the classes
  in the glue library, here is an overview:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Smart pointers

      <ul>
        <li>See <a href="../nsCOMPtr.html">nsCOMPtr User's Manual</a>.</li>

        <li>Support in the glue library also includes:.

          <ul>
            <li>do_QueryInterface</li>

            <li>do_CreateInstance</li>

            <li>do_GetService</li>

            <li>do_GetInterface</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Weak References

      <ul>
        <li>See <a href="../weak_references.html">nsIWeakReference</a>
        documentation.</li>

        <li>Support in the glue library also includes:

          <ul>
            <li>do_QueryReferent</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>nsISupports Support

      <ul>
        <li>Macros for various implementions of nsISupports.</li>

        <li>Macros for handling reference counting, and object
        instantation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>nsMemory

      <ul>
        <li>A static class wrapper around the global nsIMemory
        implemention.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>nsDebug

      <ul>
        <li>A static class which provides basic assertion and pre/post
        condition checking.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Generic Module Support

      <ul>
        <li>See <a href="../generic-factory.html">generic factories</a>
        documentation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Putting it all together</h2>

  <p>If you are building an XPCOM component or embedding Gecko, linking to the
  glue static library and string library will reduce the dependancies which you
  may have on XPCOM. In this case be aware you will also have to link to
  NSPR.</p>

  <p>When building, make sure that the build define XPCOM_GLUE is defined. This
  will ensures that the proper calling convention is used on the functions in
  the glue library. If you forget this step, you may have troubles linking.</p>

  <p><img src="safeComponent.jpg" alt="Linked libraries" height="222" width=
  "388"></p>

  <p>If you use this method, you should double-check all of the dll imports
  from your component or application. On Windows, for example, run:
  <code class="command">"dumpbin /imports &lt;FILE&gt;"</code>. This will
  produce a listing of all the code required to run your component or
  application. If you see that you require symbols from XPCOM, make sure that
  they are listed in nsXPCOM.h. If the function is not listed there, chances
  are you should not be using it.</p>

  <p>Below is a snapshot of the xpcom includes from an embedding example.
  Clearly, this embedding example must ship its own copy of XPCOM to maintain
  compatibility.</p>

</pre>

  <p>However, linking in the standalone glue library and string library we get
  something much more reusable:</p>

  <pre class="code">
    xpcom.dll
                43C6F4 Import Address Table
                43C3A0 Import Name Table
                     0 time date stamp
                     0 Index of first forwarder reference

                 888  NS_ShutdownXPCOM
                 86C  NS_InitXPCOM2
                 87B  NS_NewNativeLocalFile
                 86B  NS_GetServiceManager
                 867  NS_GetComponentManager
</pre>

  <p>All of these functions are frozen and extern "C". This means that they are
  unaffected by any changes to the XPCOM library. It is also possible to
  eliminate these symbols altogether by dynamic loading.</p>

  <h2>Dynamic Loading</h2>

  <p>The glue library (xpcomglue.lib) provides stubs to the public frozen
  functions that XPCOM provides. The library will dynamically load the public
  symbols from the XPCOM library, producing two important results. First, the
  component or application will not have to link with XPCOM for any symbol. In
  fact having to link to any Gecko library after this dynamic loading happens
  is an immediate indication that something is wrong. Second, if the glue code
  can load XPCOM, the same glue code can also unload XPCOM. So an embedding
  application will able to shut down Gecko when it is not needed and to restart
  it at will.</p>

  <p>To use this library, you need to initalize the library with the path to
  the xpcom library proper. If you don't have this path, you can use the
  default location by passing nsnull:</p>

  <pre class="code">
extern "C"
nsresult NS_COM XPCOMGlueStartup(const char* xpcomFile);

extern "C"
nsresult NS_COM XPCOMGlueShutdown();
</pre>

  <p>The first function sets up these stub functions. If you do not call this
  function, any call to a public xpcom function will fail. If you do not want
  this functionaltiy, you can rebuild this library with the flag
  "XPCOM_GLUE_NO_DYNAMIC_LOADING".</p>
