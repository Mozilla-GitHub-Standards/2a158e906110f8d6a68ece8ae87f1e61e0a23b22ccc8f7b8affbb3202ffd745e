<H2>The Message</H2>

Well, the changes are here.  They have yet to be checked in as they
will require a carpool and help from |nsCOMPtr| clients.  The short
story is I have adapted |nsCOMPtr| according to the results of all our
recent discussions and Gecko's needs.  I have optimized the
implementation to significantly reduce bloat (possibly even to the
point of being negligible; though more analysis is required) and also
to make an |nsCOMPtr| exactly the same size as a raw COM interface
pointer, so that we can use |nsCOMPtr|s everywhere they make sense. 
Continue reading for the long story...


Interface changes:

  + The |getter_doesnt_AddRef(x)| mechanism is gone.  It didn't appear
    in the source, so no worries.  Authors of functions that return
    raw COM interface pointers through parameters, e.g.,

      nsresult GetSomeFoo( IFoo** result ); // or
      nsresult GetSomeBar( void** result );

    _must_ |AddRef| the pointer before they return it.  This has
    always been the rule; but now it is officially a bug if you break
    it.

  + The constructors and assignment operators that accepted raw COM
    interface pointers are gone.  Essentially, where before you had
    to make the choice between

        // The OLD way...
      nsCOMPtr&lt;IFoo&gt; fooP( barP ); // calls |QueryInterface|
      nsCOMPtr&lt;IFoo&gt; fooP( dont_QueryInterface(barP) );

    where the first choice implicitly called |QueryInterface|, you now
    choose between |dont_QueryInterface| and its counterpart
    |do_QueryInterface|, forcing the |QueryInterface| to be explicit.
    Additionally, you may optionally recover the error, if any, from
    the underlying |QueryInterface|

        // The NEW way...
      nsCOMPtr&lt;IFoo&gt; fooP( dont_QueryInterface(barP) );
      nsCOMPtr&lt;IFoo&gt; fooP( do_QueryInterface(barP) );

        // I may want to recover the result of |QueryInterface|...
      nsresult error;
      nsCOMPtr&lt;IFoo&gt; fooP( do_QueryInterface(barP, &amp;error) );

        // Similarly for assignment...
      fooP = do_QueryInterface(barP);
      fooP = do_QueryInterface(barP, &amp;error);

    Eliminating construction and assignment from raw pointers is a big
    change that will break lots of code.  As an intermediate step I
    can check in initially commenting out the |explicit| in the
    constructor underlying |do_QueryInterface|.  This will cause most
    old code to continue to compile, and people who want to help me
    convert to the new form can just un-comment that line to find all
    the bad places...

  + The operators for comparing an |nsCOMPtr| with raw COM interface
    pointers are gone.  It is now illegal to have a bare comparison
    against a raw COM interface pointer.  Instead, you must select
    between the two possible meanings of such a comparison...

      nsCOMPtr&lt;IFoo&gt; fooP;
      IBar* barP;
 
        // ...

        // Are the pointers identical?
      if ( fooP.get() == barP )
        // ...

        // Do they point to the same object?
      if ( fooP == nsCOMPtr&lt;IFoo&gt;(barP) )
        // ...

      // The former relationship implies the latter.  The reverse
      // is not true.

    This also means that, although

      if ( NS_NULL != fooP )
        // ...

    _did_ compile on some (not all) platforms, it will now fail to
    compile on _all_ platforms.  The appropriate replacement is

      if ( fooP )
        // ...

        // or conversely
      if ( !fooP )
        // ...

  + The short lived mechanism for extracting the last error from an
    implicit call to |QueryInterface|, i.e., |assignment_error()|,
    has been removed.  Now calls to |QueryInterface| are explicit,
    and you have the opportunity to capture the result as show above.


Implementation changes:

  + Now that |getter_doesnt_AddRef| and |assignment_error()| are gone,
    so are the member variables that bloated |nsCOMPtr|s out to eight
    bytes.  An |nsCOMPtr| is now exactly the same size as a raw COM
    interface pointer.

  + After profiling the generated code, I have extracted some bulky
    |inline|s into non-|inline| member functions in a non-|template|
    base class.  This will add a single file to the XPCOM library.

    The result of this work is that bloating is significantly reduced.
    Given the following functions, pulled directly from my unit tests,
    identical except for which mechanism they use

        // Here using raw COM interface pointers...
      static
      nsresult
      TestBloat_Raw()
        {
          IBar* barP = 0;
          nsresult result = CreateIBar(&amp;barP);

          if ( barP )
            {
              IFoo* fooP = 0;
              if ( NS_SUCCEEDED(
                    result = barP-&gt;QueryInterface(IFoo::IID(), &amp;fooP)
                   ) )
                {
                  fooP-&gt;print_totals();
                  NS_RELEASE(fooP);
                }

              NS_RELEASE(barP);
            }

          return result;
        }


        // ...and here using |nsCOMPtr|s...
      static
      nsresult
      TestBloat_nsCOMPtr()
        {
          nsCOMPtr&lt;IBar&gt; barP;
          nsresult result = CreateIBar( getter_AddRefs(barP) );

          nsCOMPtr&lt;IFoo&gt; fooP( do_QueryInterface(barP, &amp;result) );

          if ( fooP )
            fooP-&gt;print_totals();

          return result;
        }

    In an optimized build on my machine, the generated code for the
    |nsCOMPtr| code is only 4 bytes longer than that of the code
    using raw COM interface pointers.  At this point, I probably
    wouldn't call the difference in size `bloat'.  Further reductions
    may be possible.  Further analysis is called for.

    As a side note, the generated code for an exception safe
    implementation using raw COM interface pointers exceeded the size
    of the first example by 160 bytes.

To be done:

  + Carpool this stuff in; changes will be required.

  + Update the documentation to match.

  + Consider renaming |getter_AddRefs| to something that makes sense
    in the absence of |getter_doesnt_AddRef|, e.g., |assign_into| or
    the like.

  + Further analysis of speed and size tradeoffs on the major
    platforms.

Hope this helps,

<H2>Epilogue</H2>

<P>
	Of course, as you read this, these changes have been checked in and working for quite some time.
	Since this message was posted, further changes have been checked in that make
		<code>nsCOMPtr</code> zero overhead with respect to
		raw COM interface pointers on both Windows and Macintosh.
	<code>nsCOMPtr</code> is now the recommended standard
		mechanism for implementing an owning pointer.
	The <A href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xpcom/nsCOMPtr.html">current documentation</A>
		has yet to be updated to match these changes;
		though posting this document and these two email messages
		(<A href="msg1.html">-1-</A>, and <A href="msg2.html">-2-</A>) should help.
</P>
