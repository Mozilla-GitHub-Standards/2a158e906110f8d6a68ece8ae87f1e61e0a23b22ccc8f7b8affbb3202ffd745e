<h1>Mozilla CA Certificate Policy (Version 1.2)</h1>

<p>When distributing binary and source code versions of Firefox,
Thunderbird, and other Mozilla-related software products the Mozilla
Foundation and its wholly-owned subsidiary the Mozilla Corporation
include with such software a default set of X.509v3
certificates for various Certification Authorities (CAs). The
certificates included by default have their "trust bits" set for
various purposes, so that the software in question can use the CA
certificates to verify certificates for SSL servers, S/MIME email
users, and digitally-signed code objects without having to ask users
for further permission or information.</p>

<div class="para">
<p>This is the official Mozilla Foundation policy for CA certificates
that the Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation distribute with
our software products:</p>

<ol>

  <li>We will determine which CA certificates are included in software
  products distributed through mozilla.org, based on the benefits and
  risks of such inclusion to typical users of those products.</li>

  <li>We will make such decisions through a public process, based on
  objective and verifiable criteria as described below.</li>

  <li>We will not charge any fees to have a CA's certificate(s)
  distributed with our software products.</li>

  <li>
    We reserve the right to not include a particular CA certificate
    in our software products, to discontinue including a particular CA
    certificate in our products, <em>or</em> to modify the "trust
    bits" for a particular CA certificate included in our products, at
    any time and for any reason.

    This includes (but is not limited to) cases where we believe
    that including a CA certificate (or setting its "trust bits" in a
    particular way) would cause undue risks to users' security, for
    example, with CAs that

      <ul>

        <li>knowingly issue certificates without the knowledge of the
        entities whose information is referenced in the certificates;
        <em>or</em></li>

        <li>knowingly issue certificates that appear to be intended
        for fraudulent use.</li>
      </ul>

    This also includes (but again is not limited to) cases where we
    believe that including a CA certificate (or setting its "trust
    bits" in a particular way) might cause technical problems with the
    operation of our software, for example, with CAs that issue
    certificates that have

      <ul>
        <li>ASN.1 DER encoding errors;</li>

        <li>invalid public keys (e.g., DSA certificates with 2048-bit
        primes, or RSA certificates with public exponent equal to
        1);</li>

        <li>duplicate issuer names and serial numbers;</li>

        <li>incorrect extensions (e.g., SSL certificates that exclude
        SSL usage, or authority key IDs that include both the key ID
        and the issuer's issuer name and serial number);
        <em>or</em></li>

        <li>cRLDistributionPoints or OCSP authorityInfoAccess
        extensions for which no operational CRL or OCSP service
        exists.</li>

      </ul>
    </li>

  <li>We will consider adding certificates for additional CAs to the
  default certificate set upon request.</li>

  <li>We require that all CAs whose certificates are distributed with
  our software products:

    <ul>

      <li>provide some service relevant to typical users of our
      software products;</li>

      <li>publicly disclose information about their policies and
      business practices (e.g., in a Certificate Policy and
      Certification Practice Statement);</li>

      <li>prior to issuing certificates, verify certificate signing
      requests in a manner that we deem acceptable for the stated
      purpose(s) of the certificates;</li>

      <li>otherwise operate in accordance with published criteria that
      we deem acceptable; <em>and</em></li>

      <li>provide attestation of their conformance to the stated
      verification requirements and other operational criteria by a
      competent independent party or parties with access to details of
      the CA's internal operations.</li>

    </ul></li>

  <li>We consider verification of certificate signing requests to be
  acceptable if it meets or exceeds the following requirements:

    <ul>
      <li>for a certificate to be used for digitally signing and/or
       encrypting email messages, the CA takes reasonable measures to
       verify that the entity submitting the request controls the
       email account associated with the email address referenced in
       the certificate <em>or</em> has been authorized by the email
       account holder to act on the account holder's behalf;</li>

      <li>for a certificate to be used for SSL-enabled servers, the CA
      takes reasonable measures to verify that the entity submitting
      the certificate signing request has registered the domain(s)
      referenced in the certificate <em>or</em> has been authorized
      by the domain registrant to act on the registrant's behalf;</li>

      <li>for certificates to be used for digitally signing code
      objects, the CA takes reasonable measures to verify that the
      entity submitting the certificate signing request is the same
      entity referenced in the certificate <em>or</em> has been
      authorized by the entity referenced in the certificate to act on
      that entity's behalf;</li>

      <li>for certificates to be used for and marked as Extended
      Validation, the CA complies with <cite><a
      href="http://www.cabforum.org/EV_Certificate_Guidelines.pdf">Guidelines
      for the Issuance and Management of Extended Validation
      Certificates</a></cite> (as modified by the <a
      href="http://www.cabforum.org/erratum.html">erratum</a>
      published by the CAB Forum) (or, for CA requests submitted on or
      before June 30, 2008, <a
      href="http://www.cabforum.org/EV_Certificate_Guidelines_draft11.pdf">draft
      11 of these guidelines</a>), and has its compliance attested to
      in accordance with the requirements of Section J of that
      document.</li>
    </ul>

    We reserve the right to use other requirements in the future.</li>

  <li>We consider the criteria for CA operations published in any of
  the following documents to be acceptable:

    <ul>

      <li>Annex B, "(Normative) Certification Authority Control
      Objectives", of ANSI X9.79-1:2001, <cite><a
      href="http://www.x9.org/standards/search/details?standard_key=3f63731c02c1074686aa37e0c1b43e72556d008f">Part
      1: PKI Practices and Policy Framework</a></cite>;</li>

      <li>Clause 7, "Requirements on CA practice", in ETSI TS 101 456
      V1.2.1 (2002-04) or later version, <cite><a
      href="http://pda.etsi.org/pda/home.asp?wki_id=vRB.0b.A2uoprrwvH-WyI">Policy
      requirements for certification authorities issuing qualified
      certificates</a></cite> (as applicable to either the "QCP public" or
      "QCP public + SSCD" certificate policies);</li>

      <li>Clause 7, "Requirements on CA practice", in ETSI TS 102 042
      V1.1.1 (2002-04) or later version, <cite><a
      href="http://pda.etsi.org/pda/home.asp?wki_id=tmTZH@WhLn_.'0,.QCFnV">Policy
      requirements for certification authorities issuing public key
      certificates</a></cite> (as applicable to any of the "NCP", "NCP+", or
      "LCP" certificate policies);</li>

      <li>"WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification
      Authorities" in <cite><a
      href="http://ftp.webtrust.org/webtrust_public/tpafile7-8-03fortheweb.doc">AICPA/CICA
      WebTrust Program for Certification Authorities, Version
      1.0</a></cite>; <em>or</em></li>

      <li>"WebTrust for Certification Authorities&mdash;Extended
      Validation Audit Criteria" in <cite><a
      href="http://www.cabforum.org/WebTrustAuditGuidelines.pdf">WebTrust
      for Certification Authorities&mdash;Extended Validation Audit
      Criteria</a></cite> (or, for CA requests received on or before
      June 30, 2008, the <a
      href="http://www.cabforum.org/WebTrustAuditGuidelines-Draft.pdf">November
      20, 2006 draft of these criteria</a>) (in conjunction with
      "WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification
      Authorities").</li></ul>

    We reserve the right to accept other criteria in the future.</li>

  <li>By "competent party" we mean a person or other entity who is
  authorized to perform audits according to the stated criteria (e.g.,
  by the organization responsible for the criteria or by a relevant
  government agency) <em>or</em> for whom there is sufficient public
  information available to determine that the party is competent to
  judge the CA's conformance to the stated criteria. In the latter
  case the "public information" referred to should include information
  regarding the party's

    <ul>

      <li>knowledge of CA-related technical issues such as public key
      cryptography and related standards;</li>

      <li>experience in performing security-related audits,
      evaluations, or risk analyses; <em>and</em></li>

      <li>honesty and objectivity.</li>

    </ul></li>

  <li>By "independent party" we mean a person or other entity who is
  not affiliated with the CA as an employee or director <em>and</em>
  for whom at least one of the following statements is true:

    <ul>

      <li>the party is not financially compensated by the CA;</li>

      <li>the nature and amount of the party's financial compensation
       by the CA is publicly disclosed; <em>or</em></li>

      <li>the party is bound by law, government regulation, and/or a
       professional code of ethics to render an honest and objective
       judgement regarding the CA.</li>

    </ul></li>

  <li>We reserve the right to designate our own representative(s) to
  act as the competent independent party or parties described above,
  should that prove to be necessary and appropriate.</li>

  <li>The burden is on the CA to prove that it has met the above
  requirements. However the CA may request a preliminary determination
  from us regarding the acceptability of the criteria and/or the
  competent independent party or parties by which it proposes to meet
  the requirements of this policy.</li>

  <li>In addition to the requirements outlined above, we also
  recommend that CAs consider using separate root CA certificates with
  separate public keys (or separate intermediate CA certificates with
  separate public keys under a single root) when issuing certificates
  according to different Certificate Policies, so that we or others
  may selectively enable or disable acceptance of certificates issued
  according to a particular policy, or may otherwise treat such
  certificates differently (e.g., in our products' user
  interfaces). We reserve the right to make this a requirement in the
  future, and to not include a particular CA certificate in our
  software products, to discontinue including a particular CA
  certificate, or to modify the "trust bits" for a particular CA
  certificate, based on the CA's practices in this regard.</li>

  <li>To request that its certificate(s) be added to the default set a
  CA should submit a formal request by submitting a <a
      href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=mozilla.org&amp;component=CA%20Certificates">bug
      report</a> into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, filed against the "CA Certificates" component of the
      "mozilla.org" product.

  The request should include the following:

    <ul>

      <li>the certificate data (or links to the data) for the CA
      certificate(s) requested for inclusion;</li>

      <li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether or
      not the CA issues certificates for each of the following
      purposes within the CA hierarchy associated with the CA
      certificate:

        <ul>
          <li>SSL-enabled servers,</li>

          <li>digitally-signed and/or encrypted email,
          <em>or</em></li>
          <li>digitally-signed executable code objects;</li>
        </ul></li>

      <li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether the
      CA issues Extended Validation certificates within the CA
      hierarchy associated with the CA certificate <em>and</em>, if
      so, the EV policy OID associated with the CA certificate;</li>

      <li>a Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement
      (or links to a CP and CPS) <em>or</em> equivalent disclosure
      document(s) for the CA or CAs in question; <em>and</em></li>

      <li>information as to how the CA has fulfilled the requirements
      stated above regarding its verification of certificate signing
      requests and its conformance to a set of acceptable operational
      criteria.</li></ul>

  We will reject requests where the CA does not provide such
  information within a reasonable period of time after submitting its
  request.</li>

  <li>We will appoint a CA certificate "module owner" to evaluate CA
      requests on our behalf and make decisions regarding all matters
      relating to CA certificates included in our products. CAs or
      others objecting to a particular decision may appeal to
      mozilla.org staff, who will make a final decision.</li>

  <li>We reserve the right to change this policy in the future. We
  will do so only after consulting with the public Mozilla community,
  in order to ensure that all views are taken into account.</li></ol>
