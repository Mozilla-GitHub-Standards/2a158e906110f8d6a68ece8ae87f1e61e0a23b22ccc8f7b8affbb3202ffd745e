    <h2 id="file-new">Filing New Site Evangelism Bugs</h2>

    <p>Make sure you read the <a href="get-started.html">Getting
    Started</a> before entering new bugs.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
      <p>
      Mozilla Tech Evangelism is not intended to be your complaint service.
      Before filing a Tech Evangelism bug on a site, <strong>first complain 
        to the site</strong> regarding their lack of support for Mozilla.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Be <strong>certain</strong> that the problem you are
        reporting is due to a Tech Evangelism issue. If you do not
        know for certain that the issue is Tech Evangelism, <a
        href=
        "http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=guided">file
        a bug against the most appropriate product</a>.</p>
      </li>

      <li><a href=
      "http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Tech%20Evangelism&amp;format=guided"
      >Enter a new Bugzilla Evangelism Bug</a> in the
      Tech Evangelism Product in Bugzilla.</li>

      <li>
        <p>Choose the <a href=
        "http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Tech%20Evangelism"
        >Component</a> to which your bug
        belongs by Language.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Choose the Platform and Operating System</p>

        <p>If you know for certain that the problem with a site is
        not Platform or Operating System specific, set the Platform
        and Operating System to All.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Choose the Initial State</p>

        <p>Use Initial State of UNCONFIRMED to ask the Mozilla
        Evangelism Community to investigate the site for
        compatibility with Mozilla. Use the Initial State of NEW to
        record a site with known problems supporting Mozilla.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Choose the Severity</p>

        <p>Use major, normal or minor Severities when reporting an
        Evangelism Bug. The other Severities do not have any real
        meaning for our purposes. Use your best judgment on how
        severe the problem is.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Assigned To</p>

        <p>If you wish to handle contacting the site yourself, set
        the Assigned To field to your email address. Otherwise
        leave Assigned To blank which will assign the bug to the
        Owner of the component you have chosen.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Enter the URL</p>

        <p>Enter the URL of the page or site that exhibits problems
        supporting Mozilla. If a particular page on a site has
        problems with Mozilla it is probable that other pages on
        the site exhibit similar problems. Visit the home page of
        the site and determine if it also has problems and what
        they are. If the site has problems in most of its content,
        then use the site's home page as the URL.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Enter the Summary</p>

        <p>Enter the 'major portion' of the URL of the site
        followed by a - and a short description of the problem as
        related to what kind of problem you experienced with the
        site. You do not have to be technical in your
        description.</p>

        <p>For example, if you were reporting on the web page
        <code>http://www.foo.bar.com/help/support/</code>, the
        'major portion' of the URL would be <code>bar.com</code>.
        This will allow people to sort Evangelism bug queries by
        their summaries and group bugs against the same company
        together.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>bar.com - Displays differently than IE5</li>

          <li>netscape.com - Does not allow Mozilla</li>

          <li>fubar.co.uk - Does not support secure connections in
          Mozilla</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The summary is something that an end user would be able
        to write and understand. More technical descriptions of the
        problem will be added to the Status Whiteboard later when
        the bug is triaged and assigned.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Enter a Description of the Problem 

        <p>Give a reasonably detailed description of the problem
        you have with the site. Many of the fields in Bugzilla we
        will use to track the bug are only available after a bug
        has been entered. Therefore give a reasonably concise
        description of the problem here. You will add more detailed
        information after you have filed the initial bug.</p>

        <p>
        Enter in any information regarding your initial contact
        with the site. <strong>Customer complaints are more
          effective than an anonymous Mozilla Technology Evangelist
          email. If you want the site to support Mozilla you must 
          register a customer complaint!</strong>
      </li>

      <li>
        Edit the Bug you just filed 

        <p>If the page does not properly display, attach a screen
        shot of the page to the bug. Make sure to assign the
        proper MIME type when attaching the image. Please try to
        minimize the size of the image. We do not need to have a
        1-megabyte jpg file of the screen shot. Reduce your color depth
        and the size of the area contained in the screen shot to
        reduce size. All you need to do is make sure the attached
        image illustrates the problems you are reporting.</p>

        <p>If the page has invalid HTML or JavaScript, save the
        HTML or JavaScript to a local file on your machine and
        attach the file to the bug as text/plain. This gives us a
        record of how the page originally was written and allows us
        to compare later versions to the version you reported the
        problem with.</p>
      </li>

    <h2 id="contacting">Contacting Sites</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
      <p>Review the bug and if necessary follow the 
      <a href="#qa">QA procedures</a></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Determine the Site owner</p>

        <p>Try to determine the correct person to contact at the
        site using information from the site itself. If you cannot
        find the appropriate person then use the Internic's <a
        href="http://www.internic.com/whois.html">Whois</a> to
        determine the necessary information.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Send Evangelism Letter</p>

        <p>Use the <a href="letters.html">Mozilla Evangelism
        Letters</a> to send a letter to the Site owner describing
        the problems with their site and what they can do to update
        their content to support Mozilla and the Standards.</p>

        <p>Remember to <strong>always</strong> be polite and
        professional when contacting sites. The E-Mail Message will
        be coming from your personal E-Mail account and you will be
        responsible for any statements you make.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Record the contact</p>

        <p>Record in the bug that you have sent the Evangelism
        letter along with a general description of any comments you
        added to the basic Evangelism letter template as well as
        the contact information but do not attach the E-Mail you
        send to the Site owner.</p>

        <p>Set the milestone for the bug to be at least a calendar
        month after the site is contacted. You can then query the
        milestone by month to follow up on sites that need to be
        retested.</p>

        <p>
        Assign the bug to yourself and mark it ASSIGNED.
        </p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If the Evangelism Letter bounces...</p>

        <p>Record the fact that the contact failed in the bug</p>

        <p>If possible try to determine another contact at the site
        and resend the Evangelism letter. If you cannot determine
        a new contact, then record that fact in the bug and mark
        the Milestone to Future.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
      <p>If the site responds negatively....</p>
      <p>Mark the bug as with <code>not-responsive</code> in the 
      status whiteboard and move on.
      We have plenty of sites to contact and can always revisit the ones that
      initially refused to support us.
      </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
