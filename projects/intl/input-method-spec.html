<h2><a name="Input_Method">Input Method Editing Styles</a></h2>

<p>Each platform (Macintosh, Windows, Unix/X) supports the input of several
Asian languages (e.g. Japanese, Chinese, Korean) through a special system
service called an Input Method. An input method is a software component
that converts key presses into text input which can't be typed directly. 
Input methods are normally used to input text for languages which have
more characters than can fit on a standard keyboard. Input methods
are commonly used for Japanese, Chinese and Korean but also show up in
other languages like Thai and Hindi.</p>

<p>There are four basic style of input method editing: on-the-spot, over-the-spot,
off-the-spot, and root-window. Only two of the styles (on-the-spot
and root window) are supported on Macintosh and Windows. The XIM
(X Input Method) standard defines all four styles, but does not require
an application or input method to support a particular set of them. 
The style used is negotiated from the set of common styles supported by
the application and the input method.</p>

<h3>On-The-Spot</h3>

<p>The composed text is rendered inside the text window by the application,
by maintaining a special editing area "between" the text before the insertion
point and the text after the insertion point. The composed text looks like
text part of the document, however, different stylistic attributes are
applied to the text into indicate that it is part of the input method composition
string. Different parts of the input method composing string will
have different styles applied to them, which indicates that they are in
different stages of editing. Once the composition text is finalized
by the user, it merges into the original document and is indistinguishable
from the surrounding text. The on-the-spot style is also know as inline
input on some platforms.</p>

<h4>Example of On-The-Spot Composition Style</h4>

<p><img src="onthespot1.jpg" height="165" width="296" alt="" class="InputExample"> The 
user types some English text prior to inputting
Japanese text. Using the arrow keys, the user moves the insertion position
between "Spot " and "Example" and switches his keyboard into Japanese Mode.
(This can be done through a hot key or a system menu)</p>

<p style="clear: both;"><img src="onthespot2.jpg" height="165" width="296" alt="" class="InputExample"> The 
user begins to type some Japanese phonetically into the edit area. The user 
types the series [n,i,h,o,n] which the input method automatically
translates into the two Japanese syllables displayed on the right. 
The Romanized "n" remains because it's conversion is still ambiguous. As
the user typed, the editor automatically expand the composition area by
moving the text "Example" as it inserted the Japanese text. The Japanese
text is displayed displayed with a dotted underline to indicate that it
is unconverted text and still has additional input steps to go through.</p>

<p><img src="onthespot3.jpg" height="165" width="296" alt="" class="InputExample"> Now 
that the user has entered the pronunciation of the word they want
to add into the document ("nihon" or the Japanese word for Japanese), the
user selects the appropriate Kanji conversion for the syllables. 
Since a single syllable has multiple possible conversions, the input method
will bring up a list of possible candidates. The user selects the
appropriate conversion which is then displayed in the document window. 
Once the user selects the appropriate conversion, the underline style of
the text changes.</p>

<p><img src="onthespot4.jpg" height="165" width="296" alt="" class="InputExample">Finally, 
the User performs some action (usually pressing the return
key) which commits the final text. The Japanese text is merged into
the document and is indistinguishable from the surrounding text.</p>

<h3 style="clear: both;">Over-The-Spot Composition Style</h3>

<p>The composed text is rendered over the insertion point in a "layer" above
the document window. The document text doesn't change until the after
the user has committed the text, so the composed text ends up obscuring
part of the document during editing.</p>

<h4>Example of Over-The-Spot Composition Style</h4>

<p><img src="overthespot1.jpg" height="108" width="301" alt="" class="InputExample"> The
user types some English text prior to inputting
Japanese text. Using the arrow keys, the user moves the insertion position
between "Spot " and "Example" and switches his keyboard into Japanese Mode.
(This can be done through a hot key or a system menu)</p>

<p style="clear: both;"><img src="overthespot2.jpg" height="108" width="244" alt="" class="InputExample"> The 
user begins to type some Japanese phonetically into the edit area. 
The user types the series [n,i,h,o,n] which the input method automatically
translates into the two Japanese syllables displayed on the right. 
As the user typed, in this style the editor draws the composing text over
the the text "Example" in the document.</p>

<p><img src="overthespot3.jpg" height="108" width="244" alt="" class="InputExample"> Next 
the user selects the appropriate Kanji conversion for the syllables. 
Since a single syllable has multiple possible conversions, the input method
will bring up a list of possible candidates. The user selects the
appropriate conversion which replaces the phonetic syllables. The
new candidate text is still drawn over the original document text.</p>

<p><img src="overthespot4.jpg" height="109" width="288" alt="" class="InputExample"> When 
the user commits the composed text, it is inserted into the document.
Unlike on-the-spot input the new text is inserted as a single operation,
instead of a series of changing strings.</p>

<h3 style="clear: both;">Off-the-Spot composition style</h3>

<p>The off-the-spot composition style is very similar to the root window
style. These two styles are distinguished only by the position of
the editing region. The off-the-spot style draws the editing region
in a status bar attached to the bottom of the active window. Each
application window has a status and editing bar, instead of having a single
independent window.

<h4>Example of Off-The-Spot Composition Style</h4>

<p><img src="offthespot1.jpg" height="176" width="279" alt="" class="InputExample"> The 
user types some English text prior to inputting
Japanese text. Using the arrow keys, the user moves the insertion position
between "Spot " and "Example" and switches his keyboard into Japanese Mode.
(This can be done through a hot key or a system menu)</p>

<p style="clear: both;"><img src="offthespot2.jpg" height="176" width="279" alt="" class="InputExample"> The 
user begins to type some Japanese phonetically into the edit area. 
The user types the series [n,i,h,o,n] which the input method automatically
translates into the two Japanese syllables displayed on the right. 
As the user typed, in this style the editor draws the composing text in
a status bar at the bottom of the document.</p>

<p style="clear: both;"><img src="offthespot3.jpg" height="176" width="279" alt="" class="InputExample">Next 
the user selects the appropriate Kanji conversion for the syllables. 
Since a single syllable has multiple possible conversions, the input method
will bring up a list of possible candidates. The user selects the
appropriate conversion which replaces the phonetic syllables. The
new candidate text is still drawn in the status bar.</p>

<p style="clear: both;"><img src="offthespot4.jpg" height="173" width="278" alt="" class="InputExample">When 
the user commits the composed text, it is inserted into the document.
Unlike on-the-spot input the new text is inserted as a single operation,
instead of a series of changing strings.</p>

<h3 style="clear: both;">Root Window composition style</h3>

<p>The composed text is rendered in an entirely separate window which has
no relationship to the application window. Once the input is committed,
it is then inserted into the document at the insertion point. The
Root window style is also know as bottom line or floating window on some
platforms.</p>

<h4>Example of Root Window Composition Style</h4>

<p><img src="rootwindow1.jpg" height="186" width="329" alt="" class="InputExample">The 
user types some English text prior to inputting
Japanese text. Using the arrow keys, the user moves the insertion position
between "Spot " and "Example" and switches his keyboard into Japanese Mode.
(This can be done through a hot key or a system menu)</p>

<p style="clear: both;"><img src="rootwindow2.jpg" height="192" width="453" alt="" class="InputExample">The 
user begins to type some Japanese phonetically. The user
types the series [n,i,h,o,n] which the input method automatically translates
into the two Japanese syllables displayed on the right. As the user
typed, the input method brings up a new window and displays the content
in that window. This process is transparent to the application.</p>

<p style="clear: both;"><img src="rootwindow3.jpg" height="190" width="454" alt="" class="InputExample"> Now 
that the user has entered the pronunciation of the word they want
to add into the document ("nihon" or the Japanese word for Japanese), the
user selects the appropriate Kanji conversion for the syllables.
This causes the text in the root window to change, but is transparent to
the application.</p>

<p style="clear: both;"><img src="rootwindow4.jpg" height="185" width="333" alt="" class="InputExample">Finally, 
the User performs some action (usually pressing the return
key) which commits the final text. The Japanese text is merged into
the document and is indistinguishable from the surrounding text.</p>

<h2 style="clear: both;"><a name="Platform_Protocols">Platform Protocols</a></h2>

<p>On each platform, input methods are supported by a protocol defined by
the platform's windowing system. The following sections give an overview
of the protocols used on each of the major platforms which Seamonkey supports. 
Consult the platform documentation for more detailed information.</p>

<p><b>Windows</b></p>

<p>The windows input method protocol involves sending four different messages
to the event handler of a particular window. To support the root
window style, the input method sends WM_CHAR events to the application.
Support for the on-the-spot (called inline in the Window's documentation)
is done through the WM_IME_STARTCOMPOSITION, WM_IME_COMPOSITION, WM_IME_ENDCOMPOSITION
messages. Windows does not use the off-the-spot or over-the-spot
styles of input.</p>

<p>Root window support is handled by the system transparent to the application.
The input method and the operating system handle displaying the various
stages of composition input until the user confirms the composition string.
The operating system handles confirmation by sending the application a
sequence of WM_CHAR messages representing the final composition string.</p>

<p>Handling on-the-spot input is a bit more complex, in that the application
must respond to three additional methods: WM_IME_STARTCOMPOSITION, WM_IME_ENDCOMPOSITION,
and WM_IME_COMPOSITION. The WM_IME_STARTCOMPOSITION and WM_IME_ENDCOMPOSITION
methods are used to bracket a single on-the-spot editing session. 
The application needs to respond to WM_IME_STARTCOMPOSITION by creating
whatever internal state is necessary for maintaining the on-the-spot composition
buffer. Conversely, the application responds to WM_IME_ENDCOMPOSITION
by deleting the composition buffer and merging that text into the document.</p>

<p>The WM_IME_COMPOSITION method contains a string which represents the
current state of the composition buffer. The application needs to
extract this string (using ImmGetCompositionString) along with the associated
composition state data and render it in the document. The application
will receive a sequence of WM_IME_COMPOSITION events as the status of the
composition buffer changes. In windows, the WM_IME_COMPOSITION buffer
always contains the complete state of the composition buffer, it is not
additive like on other platforms.</p>

<p><b>Macintosh</b></p>

<p>The Macintosh uses a protocol composed of four different AppleEvents
as well as standard events to support on-the-spot input, while root window
input is sent to the application through Get/WaitNextEvent event loop.
Like Windows, macintosh does not support off-the-spot or over-the-spot
styles.</p>

<p>Root window support is again virtually transparent to the application.
The input method and the operating system handle the display of the composition
window and it's contents. Once the composition string is confirmed,
the operating system sends the application a series of events. An
important point to note here is that the Macintosh will send Asian characters
as two events with the high byte of the character code in the first event
and the low byte in the second event.</p>

<p>On-the-spot input is accomplished through the TSM AppleEvent suite:
Position2Offset, Offset2Position, Update, and GetText. The Position2Offset
and Offset2Position events are used to map between the document/application's
text buffer and global screen coordinates.</p>

<p>The Position2Offset event requests a "hit test" of a particular point
in the global screen coordinates. The application responds to this
event by constructing a AppleEvent reply consisting of the buffer offset
and region class of that particular point. The region class indicates
if the point is outside the applications windows, inside one of the applications
windows or inside the active composition area. The offset is a fixed
(linear) offset from the beginning of the document text buffer or a relative
offset (from the start of the active input area) depending on the region
class of the point. Offset2Position does the reverse mapping taking
an offset and converting it into a global screen coordinate. The
offset is relative to the start of the composition region, if it exists;
otherwise, it is relative to the start of the text buffer.</p>

<p>The Update event is used to change the status of the composition buffer.
The Update event contains a string of characters that need to be drawn
in the composition area. Unlike windows, the Macintosh Update event
is additive so not all Update events will contain the complete string to
draw. The application receives a sequence of Update events as the
composition buffer changes. There is no special event like WM_IME_STARTCOMPOSITION
signaling beginning of a composition sequence. Ending composition is signaled
by a -1 in the composition buffer length.</p>

<p>GetText is used to reverse a commit operation. A user selects
some text then does a special Undo operation. The selected text is
then converted into a composition area. The application creates a
new composition editing area and the composition buffer is initialized
the the selected string.</p>

<p><b>Unix/X-Windows</b></p>

<p>Unix/X-Windows XIM, X Input Method protocol, uses a callback mechanism
to support all four styles of input; however the application and the input
method aren't required to support any particular styles. The application
selects a style to use by comparing the styles that are supported by both
the application and the input method and applying some algorithm to determine
which style is the best for that particular language.</p>

<p>Once a style is selected, the application registers the appropriate
callbacks with the system and provides (through system calls on the XIC
- X Input Context) what ever font or geometry information is required for
that style. Root window style requires a minimal amount of work for
the application, all it needs to appropriately convert key presses into
Input Method input using XwcLookupString or XmbLookupString.</p>

<p>Over-the-Spot style requires the application to provide the input method
with information about about the current font and the location (coordinates)
of the spot. The application must change the font and spot location
information (through XSetICValue) as the document editing progresses.</p>

<p>Off-the-Spot requires the application to provide the same information
as Over-the-Spot, but it also must handle geometry negotiation with the
input method. Since the input method needs to draw text in an area
of the applications window, the application needs to register a Geometry
negotiation callback with the system so that the input method can request
a larger area if necessary, or can be informed of changes to the application
window's geometry.</p>

<p>On-the-Spot style requires the application to register a set of callbacks
of similar complexity to the events used in Windows and MacOS. To
support On-the-Spot, the application must register the following callbacks:
PreeditStart, PreeditDone, PreeditDraw, and PreeditCaret. PreeditStart
and PreeditDone are called at the beginning and end of preedit (i.e. input
method) input. PreeditDraw is called when the input method wants
the application to display the preedit region or changing some of the highlighting
or the various input method clauses. PreeditCaret is called when
the input method wants the application to move the position of the inserton
point within the predit area.</p>

<h2><a name="Editor_Functions">Editor Functions</a></h2>

<p>The approach that we plan to take for supporting Input Methods in Seamonkey
is to find a common set of primitive operations which can be implemented
in cross platform code and can be combined in appropriate ways to support
a specific platform input method protocol.</p>

<p>To support input method editing in Seamonkey, we need to add the following
methods to the editor component:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start Composition</li>
  <li>EndComposition</li>
  <li>SetCompositionString</li>
  <li>SetCompositionHilighting</li>
  <li>SetcaretPosition</li>
  <li>GetCaretCoordinates</li>
  <li>GetOffsetFromCoordinates</li>
  <li>GetRegionCoordinatesFromOffset</li>
</ul>

<p>These actions should support the input method functionality required for
the various input method protocols.</p>

<p><b>Start Composition</b>

<p>The Start Composition method is used to signal the beginning of a composition
operation. In response to this method, the editor needs to set up
any context information and state to handle input method editing. 
The editor needs to create the initial, empty preedit area.</p>

<p>The preedit area needs to be implemented differently from a raw selection
since it is not hilighted and the user must be able to move the insertion
point around inside the preedit area. The editor needs to remember
the location and size of the preedit area, which can expand and contract
as the user types.</p>

<p>The transaction manager should not record the intermediate transactions
in-between a Start Composition and an EndComposition operation. The
composition operation should be represented as a single transaction moving
from the state before the Start Composition to the state just prior to
the EndComposition.</p>

<p>Only a single preedit area can be active at one time.</p>

<p><b>EndComposition</b></p>

<p>The EndComposition method is used to close a preedit area and permanently
commit the predit text into the content buffer. The typing changes
between Start Composition and EndComposition should be represented as a
single transaction.</p>

<p><b>SetCompositionString</b></p>

<p>The SetCompositionString method is used to set the current text of the
preedit area. SetCompositionString can only be used when there is
an active preedit area (i.e. in between Start/EndComposition calls) in
the input buffer. Each call to SetCompositionString needs to set
the entire Preedit text (unlike some platforms which make use of additive
changes).</p>

<p><b>SetCompositionHilighting</b>

<p>The SetCompositionHilighting method is used to apply application private
CSS style attributes to the text in the preedit area, so that it is hilighted
according to the platform's UI requirements. The CSS style attributes
are symbolic representations for the various different highlight states
(confirmed, raw, unconfirmed) used by input methods to provide the user
with feedback on the text conversion.</p>

<p><b>SetCaretPosition</b></p>

<p>The SetCaretPostion method is used to position the insertion point (caret)
at a particular offset within the preedit area. This method will
not move that caret outside of the preedit area. The offset is relative
to the beginning of the preedit area and is specified in terms of Unicode
characters.</p>

<p><b>GetCaretCoordinates</b></p>

<p>The GetCaretCoordinates returns the global screen coordinates of the
current Caret position, if there is no caret the method returns the appropriate
status code.</p>

<p><b>GetCoordinatesOfOffset</b></p>

<p>The GetCoordinatesOfOffset method returns the global screen coordinates
of the given offset into preedit area. The offset is relative to
the start of the preedit area and is specified in terms of Unicode characters.</p>

<p><b>GetOffsetFromCoordinates</b></p>

<p>The GetOffsetFromCoordinates method does the reverse of GetCoordinatesOfOffset.
It returns the offset into the preedit area based on the character positioned
at the particular set of coordinates. The offset is specified in
terms of Unicode characters.</p>

<p><b>GetRegionClassFromCoordinates</b></p>

<p>The GetRegionClassFromCoordinates returns the region class (inside a
document window, inside preedit area, outside application windows) of a
particular set of global screen coordinates.</p>

<p>Note: this is a general function which needs to be supported by more
components than the editor.</p>
