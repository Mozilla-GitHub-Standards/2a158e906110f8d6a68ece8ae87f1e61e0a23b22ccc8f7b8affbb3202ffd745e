Abstract

This paper describes the inspiration, goals, design and implementation
of the Blackwood project.  In short, Blackwood is a loose collection of
software projects intended to demonstrate several viable ways to add
value to the Netscape 6/Mozilla platform by leveraging the Java
Platform.  Currently Blackwood consists of six projects; Pluglets:
allows one to write and run Netscape 6 Plugins in the Java programming
language; JavaDOM: allows signed Java applets and Java applications to
access and manipulate the mozilla DOM; Webclient: a generic Web Browser
API in Java which happens to be implemented in native code by Netscape
6; Java Util: a small collection of pure java utility classes used in
the other Blackwood projects; BlackConnect: allows one to write Netscape
6 XPCOM components in Java; and OJI: allows one to plug a Java VM into
Netscape 6 to run applets.

    Conclusion

      Successes:

        We have some good ideas
        We have lots of interested parties

      General shortcomings:

        lack of cohesion
        lack of official executive buy-in
        not a product: lack of enforced schedule, marketing support
