<H2><A NAME="Intro">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>

This document is an engineer's overview of the mozilla wrapping
implementation of webclient that is compliant with the requirements
spec.  It is intended as a supplement to the comments in the code.  The
implementation was written toward <A
HREF="../RequirementsSpec.html">version 1.6 of the spec</A>.  The term
"custom app" is used in this document.  The custom app is the third
party written application that is using webclient to add browsing
capability to its feature set.  As of this writing, all of the classes
and interfaces mentioned here do exist in the current implementation,
but not nearly all of the methods are implemented.  Enough is
implemented to provide webclient M2 functionality, plus bookmarks
viewing, and a DocumentLoadListener event.

</P>

<H2><A NAME="Directories">Source Code Directory and Java Package
Hierarchies</A></H2>

<P>

This section explains the source code directory structure, and what is
available in each directory.  All paths are relative to
<CODE>mozilla/java/webclient</CODE>.  Directories are examined
depth-first.

<H2><A NAME="Objects">Object Hierarchy</A></H2>

<P>This section covers the interface and implementation object
hierarchies.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="Public">Public</A> Interfaces and Classes</H3>

<P> The following UML diagram shows the interfaces and classes
comprising the current implementation and the relationships among them.
Other interfaces and classes defined in the spec, but not yet
implemented will be filled in as appropriate.
</P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="classdiag.gif"></IMG>
</CENTER>

<P> There is one BrowserControlFactory instance per webclient
application.  This instance is used to create BrowserControl instances.
There is one BrowserControl instance per browser window.  Each
BrowserControl instance is composed of several constituent interfaces.
Instances of these interfaces can be obtained by doing queryInterface()
on the BrowserControl instance, passing in the appropriate string, of
the form "webclient.BrowserControlCanvas", "webclient.CurrentPage", etc.
</P>

<P>
The custom app add()'s the BrowserControlCanvas instance to its window
hierarchy.  The custom app can be notified of webclient events by
implementing a WebclientEventListener subinterface and adding that
implementation using the EventRegistration interface.  The
custom-app-defined listener will then receive WebclientEvent instances
of the appropriate type at the appropriate time.  The custom app can
display the browser's bookmarks in a JTree using the Bookmarks
interface.
</P>

<P>For descriptions of all the clases, please consult the spec.</P>

<H3><A NAME="PrimaryPrivate">Primary</A> Private Classes</H3>

<P>The following UML diagram shows the primary private classes that
comprise the java wrapper for the native implementation.  Bookmarks and
other secondary classes are dealt with separately.  Please note that the
classes BrowserControlImpl, ImplObject, and WrapperFactory are in the
org.mozilla.webclient java package, while all the other classes are in
the org.mozilla.webcllient.wrapper_native package.  In general, when one
implementation class interacts with another, the interaction is done
through the public interface.  That is, webclient classes don't have
access to other webclient classes's implementation details.
</P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="private-classdiag.gif"></IMG>
</CENTER>

<P>WrapperFactoryImpl and BrowserControlImpl</P>

<P>BrowserControlImpl implements the BrowserControl interface.
BrowserControlImpl uses a concrete subclass of WrapperFactory,
WrapperFactoryImpl, to create instances of implementations of webclient
interfaces.  The concrete WrapperFactory subclass is provided by the
wrapper_native package.  See
classes_spec/org/mozilla/webclient/WrapperFactory.java for details.
WrapperFactoryImpl calls the first native method, nativeInitialize.  See
classes_spec/org/mozilla/webclient/wrapper_native/WrapperFactoryImpl.java#nativeInitialize()
for details, but briefly, nativeInitialize() does the per-application
(as opposed to per-window) browser initialization.
</P>

<P>BrowserControlCanvas</P>

<P>The user must send queryInterface() to the BrowserControl instance to
obtain implementations of webclient interfaces.  The first interface
asked for must be "webclient.BrowserControlCanvas".  PENDING(): is this
requirement a problem?  The user must then add() the canvas to its
window hierarchy.</P>

<P>ImplObject and WindowControlImpl</P>

<P>Adding the canvas to the display hierarchy causes a WindowControlImpl
to be created.  This class, as well as all classes implementing
webclient interfaces, inherit from ImplObject.  ImplObject simply
defines the common attributes for all webclient implementation classes.
These attributes are currently: the WrapperFactory, and the
BrowserControl.  See
classes_spec/org/mozilla/webclient/ImplObject.java#myFactory for details.
The first method of WindowControl called is createWindow().
createWindow() calls the first per-window native call,
nativeCreateInitContext(), which allows the native code to create a
"context object" that is passed to all subsequent native methods.  It
then creates and starts a java thread, NativeEventThread, and wait()s.
When run, this thread completes the initialization process, sends the
WindowControl instance notify(), and goes into an infinite loop.  On
receiving notify() WindowControl.createWindow() returns.  All of this
happens on the add() method.  PENDING(): is it a problem that the user
must add() the BrowserControlCanvas in order for createWindow() to be
called, to do per-window initialization?
</P>

<P>NavigationImpl, CurrentPageImpl, HistoryImpl</P>

<P>
After add()ing the canvas to the custom app display hierarchy, the user
may then call BrowserControl.queryInterface() for any other webclient
interfaces.  The following classes all have similar, straightforward,
implementations: NavigationImpl, CurrentPageImpl, HistoryImpl.  These
classes all use a native event system, explained below in the
descriptions for nsActionEvent, and NativeEventThread, to cause the
propogation of actions to the underlying browser.
</P>

<P>nsActionEvent and subclasses</P>

<P>The webclient native method implementations use an event queue to
send actions to the browser.  The use of an event queue for sending
actions to the browser was present in the initial webclient code
obtained from Kirk and Ian.  Using the event queue provides
synchronization at the native level via mozilla monitors.  To examine
how these nsActions work, see the comments for the nsActionEvent class
definition in nsActions.h.  These comments lead you through the source
files that touch nsActionEvent subclasses. </P>

<P>NativeEventThread and EventRegistrationImpl</P>

<P>
NativeEventThread is a java.lang.Thread subclass.  It is created as
mentioned in the section on WindowControlImpl.  There is one instance of
NativeEventThread per BrowserControlImpl.  NativeEventThread has two
purposes: 1. to process events from the java to the browser. 2. to
process events from the browser to java.  The details of sending events
from java to the browser is described above, in the section on
nsActionEvent.  The details of sending an event from the browser to java
are as follows.  When the custom app calls
EventRegistration.add*Listener(), the corresponding method in
EventRegistrationImpl is called.  The different add*Listener methods
simply provide type safety.  They all call thru to
NativeEventThread.addListener(), which ends up adding the corresponding
mozilla listener type.  See NativeEventThread#addListener().  When a
mozilla event occurrs for which the appropriate listener has been added,
the native code calls NativeEventThread.nativeEventOccurred(), passing
the listener to which the event should be sent, and an event specific
long value.  nativeEventOccurred() uses java reflection to determine
what kind of WebclientEvent should be created and sent to the listener's
eventDispatched() method.
</P>

<P>WebShellInitContext</P>

<P>There is one instance of this struct per Java WindowControlImpl.
This is a context struct used for holding per-window mozilla references.
The instance is created as a result of calling
WindowControl.createWindow().  PENDING(): it should be destroyed as a
result of calling BrowserControl.terminate(). </P>

<P>*ObserverImpl</P>

<P>Currently, there is only DocumentLoaderObserverImpl, which serves as
the shim between mozilla events and DocumentLoadListener events.  See
DocumentLoaderObserverImpl.h.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="SecondaryPrivate">Secondary</A> Private Classes</H3>

<P>This section deals with private webclient classes that are not part
of the core functionality.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Bookmarks">Bookmarks</A></H4>

<P>The bookmarks interface uses mozilla's RDF bookmarks system to allow
the custom app to have acces to mozilla's bookmarks.  The following
class diagram describes the bookmarks system.</P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="bookmarks.gif"></IMG>
</CENTER>

<P>BookmarksImpl</P>

<P>As expected, the custom app obtains a reference to the singleton
BookmarksImpl by doing queryInterface on the BrowserControl.  Bookmarks
provides a way for the custom app developer to show a Swing JTree based
UI for the bookmarks.  When sent getBookmarks, it calls
nativeGetBookmarks(), wraps a BookmarkEntryImpl instance around the
returned int, which is actually an nsIRDFResource, and creates a
DefaultTreeModel around the new BookmarkEntryImpl.</P>

<P>RDFTreeNode</P>

<P>This abstract base class provides a java wrapper to the mozilla RDF
implementation.  PENDING(): this only works with RDF graphs that don't
have cycles.  There is an abstract method, newRDFTreeNode, which is
called from several other places in RDFTreeNode.  </P>

<P>ISupportsPeer</P>

<P>This abstract class allows RDFTreeNode instances, which have an
associated native nsIRDFResource peer, to be properly garbage collected
in both Java and XPCOM.  It does this by simply providing native methods
for XPCOM's AddRef() and Release().  nativeAddRef() can be called from
the constructor of a java subclass.  This method isn't used since the
AddRef()ing comes at the native level.  nativeRelease() is called from
the java subclass's finalize() method.
</P>

<P>BookmarkEntryImpl</P>

<P>This concrete subclass of RDFTreeNode provides a Properties instance
into which the bookmarks meta-data is stored.  PENDING(): not yet
implemented.  Instances of BookmarkEntryImpl are created both by the
RDFTreeNode's newRDFTreeNode() method, and by
Bookmarks.newBookmarkEntry().  The latter method is for when the custom
app wants to add a new bookmark.  They will call
Bookmarks.newBookmarkEntry(), fill in the Properties, and call
Bookmarks.addBookmark() with the new bookmark and an option parent
BookmarkEntry. </P>

<P>RDFEnumeration</P>

<P>In order to fulfill the TreeNode contract, RDFTreeNode must provide a
children() method which returns a java.util.Enumeration of the node's
children.  This class provides that enumeration.  It simply calls
through to native RDF methods.</P>
