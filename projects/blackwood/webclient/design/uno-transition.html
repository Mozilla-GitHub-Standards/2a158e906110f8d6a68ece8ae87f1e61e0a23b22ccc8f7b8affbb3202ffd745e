    <h1>Using Webclient in StarOffice</h1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>

This document describes the proposed strategy for using webclient in
StarOffice.  If you don't know what webclient is, it is a Java API that
wraps the mozilla embedding API and enables one to add a web browser to
a java application.  For more details, visit the webclient homepage [<A
HREF="#Ref1">1</A>].

</P>

<H2>Goal of the "Webclient in StarOffice" Project</H2>

<P>

The goal of the Webclient in StarOffice Project is to arrive at a
maintainable solution for embedding webclient into StarOffice that adds
as little extra code as possible to the existing webclient codebase,
while not requiring StarOffice to use Java to access the webclient API.
Such a solution will have the attribute that when a feature is added to
the webclient java API, little work will have to be done to expose that
feature to the StarOffice webclient.

</P>

<H2>The Existing webclient</H2>

<P>

The above diagram illustrates the call path from the user app, which
uses webclient to get browsing behavior, to mozilla, which provides the
browsing behavior.  

</P>

<P>

Webclient currently uses JNI as the browser abstraction layer.  There is
no browser specific code in the Java.  If we wanted to wrap another
browser, say IE, we would rewrite the "webclient JNI code" layer to talk
to IE.

</P>

<H2>The Proposed Webclient for UNO</H2>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="webclient-uno-proposed.gif"></IMG>
</CENTER>

<P>

My proposal is to define an UNO API that matches the Java API 1 for 1,
then modify the "webclient JNI code" layer so that it can be called from
the "webclient UNO interface" layer.  Before you get all worried and say
"but I thought we wouldn't have to use Java!" realize that we don't have
to use Java.  There are two key concepts to my proposal:

</P>

<P>
	<OL>

	  <LI> <P>The amount of actual JNI functionality used in the
	  "webclient JNI code" layer is pretty small.  I propose, and
	  indeed have implemented, that we wrap all JNI specific code in
	  the "webclient JNI code" layer in a small set of utility
	  functions.</P>
	  </LI>

	  <LI> <P>Create a local jni.h that defines only the necessary JNI
	  types used in the "webclient JNI code" layer.  This locally
	  defined jni.h is included in the code in the "webclient UNO
	  interface" layer.</P>
	  </LI>


	</OL>

</P>

<P>I feel strongly that both of these concepts are necessary to achieve
the above mentioned goal, but I'm open to suggestions.</P>

<P>

To illustrate concept 1, in the existing webclient we might have:

</P>

<P><CODE><PRE>
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_org_mozilla_webclient_wrapper_1native_NavigationImpl_nativeLoadURL
(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj, jint webShellPtr, jstring urlString)
{
    jobject			jobj = obj;
    const char	*	urlChars = (char *) env->GetStringUTFChars(env, 
                                                                   urlString);
    
    printf("Native URL = \"%s\"\n", urlChars);

// ... omitted code for telling mozilla to load a URL

    env->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, urlString, urlChars);
}
</PRE></CODE></P>

<P>

But in the proposed "webclient for UNO" we would have.

</P>



<P><CODE><PRE>
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_org_mozilla_webclient_wrapper_1native_NavigationImpl_nativeLoadURL
(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj, jint webShellPtr, jstring urlString)
{
    jobject			jobj = obj;
    const char	*	urlChars = (char *) ::util_GetStringUTFChars(env, 
                                                                 urlString);
    
    printf("Native URL = \"%s\"\n", urlChars);

// ... omitted code for telling mozilla to load a URL

    ::util_ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, urlString, urlChars);
}    
</PRE></CODE></P>

<P>

Basically, all occurrences of <CODE>env->Func(...</CODE> are replaced
with <CODE>::util_Func(env...</CODE>.  Then, the code in the
<CODE>::util_Func</CODE> implementations will use some form of logic,
probably conditional compilation, to do the right thing whether the
function is being called from Java, or from the "webclient UNO
interface" layer.  If the util_Func is being called from the "webclient
UNO interface" layer, JNIEnv will be NULL, but that's OK since we'll use
locally implemented functions instead of those provided by JNI.

</P>

<P>The code in the "webclient UNO interface" layer will look something
like this:</P>

<P><CODE><PRE>
// UNO method declaration for LoadURL, something like
void Navigation::LoadURL(sal_Int32 webShell, const sal_wChar *url)
{
    jstring urlJString = ::util_NewString(url);
    Java_org_mozilla_webclient_wrapper_1native_NavigationImpl_nativeLoadURL(NULL, NULL, webShell, urlJString);
    ::util_DeleteString(urlJString);
}
</PRE></CODE></P>

<P>

To illustrate concept 2, in the existing webclient we have code in the
"webclient JNI code" layer including the jni.h from the JDK.  In the
proposed webclient, we use Makefile logic to change which jni.h gets
included.  When compiling webclient.dll for use in Java, the real jni.h
will get used.  When compiling webclient.dll for use in StarOffice, the
locally defined jni.h will get used.  Note that the locally defined
jni.h is much smaller than the real jni.h, and only defines those types
actually used in the "webclient JNI code" layer.

 </P>

<H2>Drawbacks to the Proposed Solution</H2>

<P>

There is no doubt that the proposed solution increases complexity.  But
I believe this solution minimizes and localizes the complexity to the
Makefile, and the ::util_Func definitions.  Furthermore, it requires no
change to the code in the "webclient JNI code" layer.  This achieves the
goal that when a feature is implemented for use in the Java version of
webclient, it is also available for use in the "webclient UNO interface"
layer.

</P>

<P>

Another drawback is the apparent in-elegance of redefining JNI symbols so
they are really NOT JNI symbols.  While this is indeed inelegant, it is
the only way to achieve the goals without increasing the complexity
substantially.

</P>

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>

Please consider the above proposal and let me know what you think as
soon as possible.  The timeliness of your answer will impact whether or
not we have a working "webclient in StarOffice" demo for InternetWorld
on 3 April 2000.
