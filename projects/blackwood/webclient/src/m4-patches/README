This directory contains source patches to enable webclient to run with M16.

You can apply the patches in two ways:

1. By unpacking the patched files into the toplevel of your mozilla tree

  - Put the file <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/blackwood/webclient/src/m4-patches/m4-patches.tar.gz> 
    into your top level mozilla directory. 

  - gunzip m4-patches.tar.gz; tar -xvf m4-patches.tar

2. By applying each patch file to the corresponding file

  - Put the file <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/blackwood/webclient/src/m4-patches/m4-patch-files.tar.gz> into some directory on your local disk

  - You must apply each patch to the correct file.  For example the
  patch nsFileLocations.patch must be applied to the file
  nsFileLocations.cpp.  Please look in each patch file to see to which
  file each patch must be applied.

  - Apply a patch by cd-ing to the appropriate directory and running 

    patch -i PATCH_FILENAME FILE_TO_PATCH

    Where PATCH_FILENAME is the patch file, ie nsFileLocations.patch,
    and FILE_TO_PATCH is the file to which the patch should be applied,
    ie nsFileLocations.cpp.
