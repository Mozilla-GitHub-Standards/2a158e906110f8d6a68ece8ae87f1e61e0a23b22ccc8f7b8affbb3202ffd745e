NINTH INTERNATIONAL WORLD WIDE WEB CONFERENCE
THE WEB: THE NEXT GENERATION

ABOUT THE CONFERENCE

The Ninth International World Wide Web Conference (WWW9) will be held
on May 15-19, 2000 in Amsterdam, the capital of The Netherlands.
Leaders from industry, academia, and government will present the
latest developments in Web technology, and discuss the issues and
challenges facing the Web community as it moves into the 21st
Century. The conference will consist of refereed paper sessions,
poster sessions, panel sessions, a W3C track, and two specialized
tracks: The Web and Industry and The Web and Society. It will also
feature presentations by keynote and invited speakers. The conference
will be preceded by a day of tutorials and workshops, and will
conclude with a developers' day.

The Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) is hosting WWW9
and playing a key role in organizing the technical program. The
International World Wide Web Conferences are events of the
International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2), and are
managed by Foretec Seminars, Inc.

Tutorials and Workshops

A program of tutorials and workshops will cover topics of current
relevance to Web design, services, operation, and use. Subjects will
include, for example, XML, SVG, Web security, E-commerce, metadata,
mobile use of the Web, and internationalization. These half- and
full-day sessions will feature internationally recognized authorities.

Developers' Day

This daylong program will be devoted to the interests of Web
developers, and will provide in-depth discussions of topics at the
forefront of Web technologies.

Exhibition

The exhibition will be held in a large, modern, hall adjacent to the
meeting rooms. Exhibitors will display the latest offerings of
Web-related hardware, software, and services. When appropriate,
vendors will be presented with an interoperability challenge.
