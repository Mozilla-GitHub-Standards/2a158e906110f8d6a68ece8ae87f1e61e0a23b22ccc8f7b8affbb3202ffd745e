    <H3>Abstract</H3>

<P>

      This paper provides an account of the author's experiences in
      implementing Webclient: an open source, generic web browser API in
      Java.  Webclient uses technology from an existing web browser,
      initially Mozilla, to implement the API.  The author discusses the
      motivation, origins, goals, and possible future directions for
      Webclient, the pro's and cons of working with mozilla, the
      processes used in developing Webclient, and gives a technical
      overview of the existing prototype implementation.

</P>

    <H3>Keywords</H3>

<P>

      Browsers, Java, components
</P>
      
    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<P>
      
      The term "browser wars" was coined to describe the battle for
      controlling the world's web browsing experience.  The primary
      combatants in the browser wars are Netscape and Microsoft.  In
      this paper, the author will relate his experiences in developing a
      product, called Webclient, that leverages the output of browser
      wars, rather than participating in them.  The mission statement of
      Webclient is: "to provide the premier browser-neutral Java API
      that enables generic web browsing capability." [<A
      HREF="#Ref1">1</A> ] The motivation for Webclient is to give Java
      developers a world class web browsing component which they can
      embed in their applications.
      
</P>    


<P>

      Webclient is a generic web browser API.  The "browser-neutral" in
      the mission statement means that the actual implementation is
      provided by an existing, possibly native code, browser, such as
      Mozilla or Microsoft Internet Explorer. The ability to wrap an
      existing browser provides several benefits:

</P>

    <UL>
      
      <LI>Webclient puts the burden of "keeping up with the
	  Joneses" where it belongs, on those who have the business need
	  and the resources to keep up with current standards and
	  rendering demands.  </LI>
      
      <LI>The flexible API allows one to provide an
	  implementation for application specific circumstances, for
	  example, small footprint devices. </LI>
      
      <LI>Webclient gives developers who are building application GUIs
          with Java world-class HTML rendering capabilities. By
          world-class we mean: super-fast, fully-functional, and
          fully-standard-supporting, well supported, widely used, well
          tested, etc.</LI>
      
    </UL>

<P>

      Webclient's design incorporates scalability, with respect to the
      underlying implementation.  The underlying browser doesn't have to
      implement the full Webclient specification.  For example, assume
      that the underlying browser implementation doesn't support
      printing, yet printing is in the Webclient API.  The Webclient
      design calls for the Webclient software to "decay gracefully" in
      this case.  That is, it is not an error to invoke methods that
      don't have an implementation.

</P>

<H3>2. Related Work</H3>

<P>

      Webclient is certainly not the first web browsing component
      available to Java application developers, but it is the first to
      rely entirely on an underlying browser for its implementation.
      While it is possible to use Microsoft's WebBrowser ActiveX control
      from Java, this requires the use of extra tools to bridge the two
      environments.  Webclient tightly integrates with the underlying
      browser, without requiring any extra tools to bridge the gap.
      There are some significant drawbacks this approach.  If the
      underlying browser is not written in Java, as in the case of
      Mozilla and Internet Explorer, there are issues the end user must
      confront, as well as issues that the Webclient developers must
      confront.  The end user issues include increased memory and disk
      footprint.  At runtime the process must include a Java virtual
      machine as well as the footprint of the native browser.  The user
      must also install more components: a Java VM, the Webclient
      software, and the native browser.  Of course installer programs
      can facilitate this process.  Issues for the Webclient developers
      when wrapping a native browser include: differing APIs between
      different browsers, dealing with memory management, and increased
      complexity of build environment.  These concerns disappear when
      the underlying browser is already in Java.  The only remaining
      concern in this case is the differing APIs, which are hidden
      beneath the consistent Webclient API in any case.
      
</P>

<P>
      The following browsers were examined during the development of
      Webclient.

</P>

	<UL>

	  <LI> ICE Browser: <A HREF="http://www.icesoft.no/ICEBrowser/">http://www.icesoft.no/ICEBrowser/</A>
          </LI>

	  <LI> CLUE: <A HREF="http://www.coolclue.com/cluehome.html">http://www.coolclue.com/cluehome.html</A>
          </LI>

	  <LI> HotJava bean: <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/software/htmlcomponent/index.html">http://www.sun.com/software/htmlcomponent/index.html</A>
          </LI>

	  <LI> Swing JEditorPane: <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/swingdoc-api-1.1/javax/swing/JEditorPane.html">http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/swingdoc-api-1.1/javax/swing/JEditorPane.html</A>
          </LI>

	</UL>

<P>

      All of the above browsers are pure Java, and each has its pros and
      cons.  The ICE Browser is small, modular, and fast, but currently
      can only correctly render well formed HTML.  The CLUE browser is
      too early in its development to be considered comparable to
      Netscape or IE.  The HotJava bean is a well known, proven product,
      written by some of the people working on Webclient, but its
      development has been terminated by Sun.  A prototype
      implementation of Webclient with a HotJava core has been
      developed, however.  The JEditorPane ships with version 1.2 of
      Sun's Java Development Kit, but also falls short of Netscape and
      IE in the quality of its browsing experience.  Thus, the author
      believes the best way to deliver a high quality browsing
      experience is to rely on products that have already proven their
      success in the marketplace.

</P>

<H3>3. Building on Shifting Sands</H3>

<P>

      It is said that only a fool builds on sand, but with the author's
      funding coming from a source that advocated using Mozilla (the
      Sun-Netscape alliance [<A HREF="#Ref11">11</A>]), there was little
      choice but to try to use it in its early and evolving state.  The
      developers of Webclient have continually felt the pain of this
      decision.  This section will detail some of the problems found in
      depending on an evolving open source project, and how they were
      dealt with.

</P>

<P>

      First there is the very matter of "bootstrapping" the whole system.
      This involves initializing the component system, setting up system
      paths, and loading dependent libraries.  The specifics of how this
      is done change frequently, and Webclient must be continually
      updated to the latest method of bootstrapping.  There are several
      other concerns related to the changing Mozilla implementation, and
      a strategy for dealing with these changes is detailed below.

</P>

<P>

      To minimize the impact of basing Webclient on an evolving
      open-source project, a strategy was adopted: Webclient would only
      depend on "milestone releases".  The Mozilla web browser project
      was being developed in an iterative fashion, and is in the habit
      of releasing semi-regular development milestones.  A milestone is
      a snapshot of the Mozilla source tree at a time when the software
      was known to be stable in some way.  Since the beginning of 1999,
      Mozilla has released a new milestone every 33 days on average.
      The idea was that Webclient would depend only on milestone
      releases.  When a new milestone was released, Webclient would take
      a temporary hit and "upgrade" the new release.  This approach
      would shield Webclient from changes in the Mozilla source code and
      any destabilizing affects these changes may have for Webclient.

</P>

<P>

      This approach works fine, as long as there are no "show stopper"
      bug fixes in Mozilla on which Webclient depends, and the
      milestones come out regularly and frequently.  Unfortunately,
      there were times when neither condition was met.

</P>

<P>

      For example, the "bin directory" bug.  While Mozilla had included
      in its charter the embedding of the browser in another
      application, the code didn't actually reflect that behavior.
      There were several cases in the code where Mozilla would make an
      assumption about the location of dynamic libraries (executable
      code that is loaded into memory by a program while it is running)
      based on the location of the main executable program.  These
      assumptions are only valid when the main executable program is the
      Mozilla browser.  The assumptions break down when the main
      executable program is the Java runtime, or any program other than
      the Mozilla main executable program.  This is the "bin directory"
      bug.  An ugly workaround for this bug had been developed in
      Webclient, but it hindered Webclient's deployability.  After the
      initial release of Webclient source code, interest in the project
      had been steadily increasing, and requiring everyone to implement
      an inconvenient workaround was a big enough problem that it had to
      be dealt with.

</P>

<P>

      The Webclient team implemented a fix in Mozilla that allows the
      bin directory to be specified at the beginning of the
      initialization sequence.  Unfortunately, due to schedule slippage
      at Netscape, the code that implemented this fix wouldn't be in a
      milestone release for an unacceptably long time.  A decision was
      made to take Webclient off the track of depending only on
      milestone releases and instead depend on the "latest" Mozilla.
      This decision proved to have unfortunate consequences.  Frequent
      behavior changes would break Webclient, forcing the Webclient team
      to engage in software sleuthing to discover the nature of the
      change and to make allowances for it in the Webclient code.

</P>

<P>

      This problem can be solved by using version control software that
      supports the concept of "integration workspaces".  Webclient could
      depend on a Mozilla-Webclient integration workspace, that would be
      synchronized to each milestone release.  The integration workspace
      would be immune from normal Mozilla development changes, but it is
      possible to accept certain specific changes that are needed.  For
      example, the changes that fix the "bin directory" bug.  When the
      milestone release containing the desired bug fix does come out,
      the integration workspace would be synchronized with the milestone
      release.

</P>

<P>

      Unfortunately, none of the popular freely available source code
      control systems support the concept of integration workspaces.
      However, it is possible to get the same end result by simply
      having another Mozilla tree, and designating it as an integration
      workspace.  This possibility is currently being investigated.

</P>

<P>

      A more general problem than the "bin directory" bug is the lack of
      features inherent in an iteratively evolving system.  For example,
      there are things in the Webclient API that are not implemented in
      any current browser.  This means that Webclient must follow the
      iterative development pattern of any evolving software on which it
      depends.

</P>

<H3>4. Software Development Processes </H3>

<P>

      There hasn't been much formal process in the Mozilla development
      effort, but Webclient has used four process-like tools in its
      development: requirements specification, requirements analysis,
      formal document review, and document change control.  The first
      two processes are intended to be done in an iterative fashion,
      independently.  That is, the requirements specification document
      may go through several iterations independent of the requirements
      analysis document, and vice versa.  The latter two processes are
      applied to a document for each iteration.
      
</P>

<P>

      The first step in the requirements specification process was to
      produce a template document which would be filled in during the
      course of the specification task.  This template underwent its own
      iterative development cycle and informal document review by peers
      and the Mozilla community, via Mozilla newsgroups.  The template
      was initially based on [<A HREF="#Ref2">2</A>] and the finished
      product is available at [<A HREF="#Ref3">3</A>].

</P>

<P>

      After completing the template, the requirements specification
      process started in earnest, taking input from several sources: the
      existing prototype, Netscape Navigator 4.x, Microsoft Internet
      Explorer 5.0, and the author's experience base.  The author did a
      "feature traversal" of Netscape and IE to gather requirements for
      the specification.  The spec was written from the perspective of
      an ideal web browser API.  No consideration was given to the
      feasibility of the features mentioned in the spec, that is left
      for requirements analysis.  Once the first draft was complete,
      several key customers were personally contacted and asked to
      review the specification.  A request for review was also sent out
      to the relevant newsgroups and mailing lists.  After integrating
      feedback from all who would give it, the spec underwent a formal
      document review process among Sun employees, after which point it
      was placed under change control.  The final requirements
      specification document can be found in [<A HREF="#Ref4">4</A>].

</P>

<P>

      The change control process requires the creation of a "Change
      Control Board", or CCB.  This is a group of people who hold a
      stake in the software and/or would be impacted by changes to the
      specification.  The CCB should meet to discuss proposed changes to
      the document, similar to the process employed by the IETF, W3C,
      and many other standards bodies.  However, the CCB process used
      for Webclient is lightweight, and much less formal.

</P>

<P>
      
      The requirements analysis process takes the requirements
      specification document and, for each target browser (Mozilla, IE,
      Hot Java, etc.), determines how much of the spec can be built
      using that browser.  This process has only been carried out for
      Mozilla, but carrying it out for other browsers is
      straightforward.  The analysis document was created as a sort of
      questionnaire, broken down into sections corresponding to the
      sections of the requirements spec.  The analysis work for each
      section was assigned to volunteers, some of whom were not Sun
      employees.  The volunteers had to answer the following questions
      in each section:
      
</P>

    <OL>
      
      <LI> How long did it take to prepare the analysis for this
	section?
      </LI>

      <LI> What is the analogous code in the native environment? 
      </LI>

      <LI> What modifications or workarounds need to be made in order to
      use the native code for the current functional grouping within an
      interface? 

	<A NAME="feasibility">For</A> each functional grouping within an interface, use the
      following scale to rate the feasibility of exposing this feature
      to Webclient: 

	<OL>

	  <LI> No brainer: the feature is already exposed
	  </LI>

	  <LI> It's glue code: the feature exists, but isn't exposed
	  </LI>

	  <LI> Needs work: the basic infrastructure for the feature is
	  there, but some significant changes need to be made in order
	  to expose the feature.
	  </LI>

	  <LI> Redesign required: the existing architecture doesn't
	  allow for this feature to be exposed.
	  </LI>

	  <LI> Impossible: a prohibitively large amount of work is
	  required to expose the feature.
	  </LI>

	</OL> 

    </OL> 

<P>

      As each section was completed, it was integrated back into the
      analysis document until the entire requirements spec had been
      analyzed.  The feasibility scale ratings and estimated
      implementation time can be used to guide the scheduling of the
      implementation work.  The final result of the analysis process is
      available in [<A HREF="#Ref5">5</A>].

</P>


<P>

      The author believes that the above processes (document review,
      requirements specification, requirements analysis, and change
      control) are well suited to web facilitated open-source software
      development.  Web based tools that automate these processes would
      be very valuable to future open source projects.

</P>

<H3>5. Technical Overview</H3>

<P>

      The Webclient API as listed in the requirements specification
      provides interfaces for accessing the following browser
      functionality: accessing bookmarks, find in page, w3c DOM access,
      copy selection to clipboard, view source, save current page,
      history access and manipulation, navigation, cache access and
      manipulation, preferences access, and printing.  These APIs
      provide enough depth of control to meet most accessibility
      guidelines.  The complete Webclient API is too long to include
      here, but it can be found in [<A HREF="#Ref4">4</A>].
</P>

<P>

      The current prototype implementation does not conform to the spec
      and provides a greatly reduced subset of its functionality.  The
      methods available in the current Webclient implementation are
      listed below.

</P>

<P></P>

    <CENTER>

      <IMG SRC="prototype-methods.gif">

    </CENTER>

<P></P>

<P>

      As mentioned in the Introduction, the Webclient API is designed to
      be backed by an existing, possibly native code browser.  In order
      to provide this functionality, obviously an abstraction layer is
      required.  The abstraction is provided by a "Shim" class [<A
      HREF="#Ref6">6</A>], specific to the underlying browser.  The shim
      class hides all the browser specific implementation details from
      the higher level Webclient classes.  The relationships between the
      Webclient classes and interfaces can be seen in the following UML
      diagram.

</P>

<P></P>

    <CENTER>
      <IMG SRC="classdiag.gif"></IMG>
    </CENTER>

<P></P>

<P>

      There is not much code in Webclient, and most of it can be found
      in the shim class.  For mozilla, the complexity of the shim class
      lies in passing events between Mozilla and Java.  This is
      accomplished by means of a message queue thread, whose sole
      purpose is to process and dispatch events.  Aside from events, the
      only thing the shim does is initialize the mozilla component
      system, and create the underlying nsIWebShell instances as
      necessary.  The Microsoft WebBrowser control has similar methods
      to nsIWebShell and the shim class for IE should be similar to the
      one for Mozilla.

</P>

<P>

      Webclient must confront the same thorny issues that any other
      cross-platform native code project must confront.  Where possible,
      Webclient relies on Netscape's abstraction layers [<A
      HREF="#Ref7">7</A>].  However, there have been some situations
      where this was not possible.  In these cases, a simple #ifdef
      solution was employed, to conditionally compile code depending on
      the current platform.

</P>

<H3>6. Summary and Future Directions</H3>

<P>

      The current Webclient prototype illustrates that it is possible
      and useful to provide a generic API on top of an underlying web
      browser.  This approach provides flexibility, scalability, and
      increased performance for the end user's browsing experience.
      Because Webclient is based in Java, the work of embedding browsing
      behavior into an application is much simpler for the end user than
      in native environments.

</P>

<P>

      Part of the impetus for submitting this paper to the World Wide
      Web Conference is to put the following question before the WWW
      development community: Would it be useful to have an official
      standardized web browser API?  This API may do for web browsing
      what the DOM API has done for document access.  The API in the
      Webclient requirements specification [<A HREF="#Ref4">4</A>] could
      serve as a starting point for this standard.

</P>

<H3>Appendix</H3>

<H4>Historical Background</H4>

<P>

      Webclient was born of an open source (MPL [<A HREF="#Ref8">8</A>])
      project, the Mozilla web browser, and continues to be developed as
      such.  In a simple definition, an open source software project has
      at least the following attributes:

</P>

    <UL>

	  <LI> Free distribution of the software
	  </LI>

	  <LI> Access to the source code 
	  </LI>

	  <LI> A mechanism for accepting from the public, any changes
	  and enhancements to the software.
	  </LI>

	</UL>

<P>

      A more rigorous definition of open source software can be found in
      [<A HREF="#Ref9">9</A>].  The Mozilla web browser project was
      started by Netscape in late March of 1998, in an attempt to
      leverage the power of open source as seen in the development of
      the Linux operating system [<A HREF="#Ref10">10</A>].  Netscape
      hopes to use the output of the Mozilla web browser project as the
      heart of its Communicator 5.0 product.  One of the many side
      effects of the open source nature of the Mozilla project was that
      for the first time, there was a possibility for cross platform
      applications to embed world class browsing behavior without having
      to provide that behavior from scratch.  The embedding of Mozilla
      into a larger application was taken into the charter of the Mozilla
      project and there are several projects underway now that aim to
      leverage Mozilla in this way.

      While the success of the open source strategy for Mozilla is
      debatable (most of the engineers working on Mozilla are employed
      by Netscape for the sole purpose of working on Mozilla), there
      have been important contributions by the general software
      development community.  One of these was the RaptorCanvas project,
      started by Kirk Baker and Ian Wilkinson in April of 1999.
      RaptorCanvas intended to embed the Mozilla WebShell interface into
      Java.  Sun Microsystems took an interest in Kirk and Ian's work in
      July of 1999 (after the Sun/AOL/Netscape deal [<A
      HREF="#Ref11">11</A>]).  The project was renamed Webclient, and
      hosted the project at mozilla.org, along side the code for the
      Mozilla web browser.  Sun expanded Webclient's charter to be more
      general than wrapping only Mozilla: making plans for wrapping the
      WebBrowser ActiveX control from Microsoft, and the Hot Java
      Browser Bean from Sun.  However, Mozilla would be the first and
      most important target browser to wrap.  The first prototype
      implementation of Webclient was checked in to mozilla.org in early
      August 1999.
