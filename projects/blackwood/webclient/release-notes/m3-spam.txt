Hi Folks,

You may have thought that webclient was no longer being developed, but
it is.

I have put together another release of webclient source code, and I'm
calling it webclient Milestone 3 (M3).  M3 is only being distributed in
source code unless someone wants to contribute WELL TESTED AND
DOCUMENTED binaries.  Webclient M3 includes support for org.w3c.dom,
java.awt.event.MouseListener, FindInPage, SelectAll, Navigation, some
History, and some Bookmarks.

For information on getting and building the code visit

I have updated the webclient homepage.  Please let me know if there are
any broken links.

If you have any trouble getting/building/running the code, please post
to netscape.public.mozilla.java.
