    <h1>ChatZilla User's Guide</h1>

    <h3>Before you start</h3>
    This page talks about the specifics of using the ChatZilla IRC client.  
    <b>Please</b> keep in mind that ChatZilla is not finished.  It is usable
    if you're willing to accept a subset of the commands offered in more mature
    IRC clients.  In fact, ChatZilla itself is built on top of a piece of
    software that itself is not finished (Mozilla, of course.) A large
    percentage of ChatZilla users experience crashes, odd behavior, rash,
    shortness of breath, and an urge to fix bugs.  If you would like to
    contribute please say so on the netscape.public.mozilla.rt-messaging
    newsgroup, or send mail to
    <a href="mailto:rginda@netscape.com">rginda@netscape.com</a>.
    <p>
      If you are not familiar with IRC, please check out the FAQs available
      at <a href="http://www.irchelp.org/">www.irchelp.org</a>.
    
    <h3>Views</h3>
    <p>
      The ChatZilla output
      window (Item 5 in the <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) only shows one
      <b>view</b> at a time.
      This view may represent messages coming from a channel you are
      speaking to, a user you are sending private messages to, a network you
      are connected to, or directly from ChatZilla.  These types of views are
      referred to as <i>Channel</i>, <i>User</i>, <i>Network</i>, and <i>Client</i>
      views.
    <p>
      You interact with the current view by way of the input box (Item 6 in
       <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.)  Generally, you type a either a line of
      text or a command in
      the input box and press the <tt>ENTER</tt> key.  A command is different
      from a line of text because all commands start with the
      <b>command character</b>, which is the "/" character by default.
      Commands instruct ChatZilla to perform some
      particular action.  What happens when you type a line of text which is
      <b>not</b> a command depends on what type of view is active.  

    <ul>
      <li>The <b>client</b> view responds to non-command text by executing
        it as JavaScript code, displaying results in the output window.
        (If you know what you're doing, or even <i>think</i> you do, this can be
        fun.  If not, don't worry about it.  I'll post more information on how
        to use this feature later [Unless someone contributes it first.])
      <li><b>Network</b> views have no default interpretation for non-command
        text.  Typing anything that is not a command while a network view is
        active will result in an error.
      <li><b>Channel</b> views will send any non-command text to the channel.
        Other channel members will see what you typed with your nickname
        attributed.
      <li><b>User</b> views will send any non-command text <b>only</b> to
        the user you are speaking to.  The targeted user will see what you
        typed with your nickname attributed, no one else.
    </ul>

    <h3>UI Elements</h3>

      </center>

    </a>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Titlebar</b>
        <br>
          The titlebar area displays information related to the current
          view.
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> If you are viewing channel activity, the titlebar will 
            display the channel name, channel mode, and topic of discussion.
            If the views toolbar
            (Item 3 in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) is
            hidden, topic information will be omitted in order to save room for
            the activity list.

            <li> If you are viewing a one-on-one chat, the titlebar will
            display the nickname of the user you are talking to.

            <li> If you are viewing messages from a network, the titlebar will
            display  the server you are connected to (if you are connected),
            your nickname (if you have successfully logged in), and the name
            of the network this server is on.

            <li> Finally, if you are viewing the *client* view, the titlebar
            will display ``ChatZilla!''
        </ul>
        <p>
          If the views toolbar is hidden, a list of views with activity will be
          appended to whatever information already appears in the titlebar.  For
          example, if the views toolbar were hidden in
          <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, the titlebar would display
          ``ChatZilla: #mozilla (+n) -- Activity [3!, 5]'' instead.  The
          exclamation point after the 3 indicates that some of the activity
          was directed to you (just as the flashing red light on the view
          button had.)  You could then switch to the #chatzilla view by
          pressing <tt>F3</tt>.
        <p>
      <li><b>Menubar</b>
        <br>
          The Menubar has the following menus...
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Options</b>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Toggles</b>
                <br>
                  Options you can turn on and off
                <p>
                <ul>
                  <li><i>Debug messages</i>
                    <br>
                      The IRC library that ChatZilla uses defines it's own event
                      model, turning debug messages on will display information
                      about the events being processed by this model.
                      On windows, you may have to run mozilla with the -console
                      option to see the debug output.
                    <p>
                  <li><i>Munger</i>
                    <br>
                      The munger is the component in ChatZilla responsible for
                      <i>munging</i> plain text into HTMLified text.  For example,
                      by default the munger will turn *this text* into 
                      <b>*this text*</b>, /this text/ into <i>/this text/</i>,
                      and _this text_ into <u>_this text_</u> as well as a
                      handful of similar transformations.  The munger is
                      also responsible for turning text into links, and figuring
                      out when someone is talking to you.  While the munger has
                      been designed to be able to deactivate any number of
                      these munging rules without affecting the others, this
                      functionality is not yet available in the UI.  All you
                      get for now is an all-or-nothing deal.

                    <p>
                </ul>
              <li><i>Logging ...</i>
                <br>
                  This option is not yet implemented.
                <p>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
          <li><b>View</b>
            <br>
              Ways to adjust what you see...
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li><i>Toolbar</i>
                <br>
                Toggles the visibility of the views toolbar.  Equivalent to
                the <tt>/toolbar</tt> command.
                <p>
              <li><i>Info Tree</i>
                <br>
                  Toggles the visibility of the info tree.  Equivalent to the
                  <tt>/names</tt> command.
                <p>
              <li><i>Statisbar</i>
                <br>
                  Toggles the visibility of the statusbar.  Equivalent to the
                  <tt>/statusbar</tt> command.
                <p>
              <li><i>Icons in View Buttons</i>
                <br>
                Toggles the visibility of LED icons in the views toolbar.  If
                the icons are off, activity will be communicated by chaging
                the color of the text in the buttons.
                <p>
              <li><b>CurrentView</b>
                <ul>
                  <li><i>Hide</i>
                    <br>
                      Drop the current view's icon from the toolbar, but save
                      it's contents.  The icon will reappear the next time
                      there is activity on the view.  Equivalent to the
                      <tt>/hide</tt> command.
                    <p>
                  <li><i>Clear</i>
                    <br>
                      Clear the current view, discarding *all* content.
                      Equivalent to the <tt>/clear</tt> command.
                    <p>
                  <li><i>Delete</i>
                    <br>
                      Clear the current view, discarding *all* content, and drop
                      it's icon from the toolbar.
                      Equivalent to the <tt>/delete</tt> command.
                    <p>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li><b>Views Toolbar</b>
        <br>
        The views toolbar contains a collection of buttons which represent the
        available views.  It can be hidden with the <i>View->Toolbar</i> menu
        option, or the <tt>/toolbar</tt> command.  The LEDs in the toolbar
        buttons change appearance depending on activity in the view they
        represent.
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <b>bright yellow</b> LED indicates that the view currently
            displayed in the output window.
            If the "Icons in View Buttons" option is turned off, activity
            directed to you is indicated by cyan text.
          <li>A <b>bright green</b> LED indicates that the view has activity.
            Additionally, each time more activity occurs, the LED will flash.
            If the "Icons in View Buttons" option is turned off, activity
            is indicated by green text.
          <li>A <b>flashing red</b> LED indicates that the view has activity
            directed to you.
            If the "Icons in View Buttons" option is turned off, activity
            directed to you is indicated by red text.
          <li>A <b>dim green</b> LED indicates that the view has no activity.
            If the "Icons in View Buttons" option is turned off, no activity
            is indicated by black text.
        </ul>
        <p>
      <li><b>Info Tree</b>
        <br>
        It's called the info tree because one day it hopes to show lots of
        different kinds of information, but so far, it only displays user
        information.
        When it is displaying user information, it does so in three columns;
        the first column indicates whether or not the user has <b>operator</b>
        privileges, if the light is one, the user is an operator.  Column two
        indicates whether or not the user has <b>voice</b> privileges, again if
        the light is on, the user "has a voice", otherwise they don't.
        The third column displays the user's nickname.
        User information can be sorted on any of the three columns in either
        ascending or descending order by clicking on the column header.
        <p>
      <li><b>Output Window</b>
        <br>
        The output window shows messages from your current view.  Messages are
        displayed in two columns.  The first indicates the type of message to
        follow, the second is the text of the message.  For channel and user
        views, messages from other users will display the nickname of the user
        who sent the message instead of the message type.
        <p>
      <li><b>Input Box</b>
        <br>
        The input box is where you type ChatZilla commands and text to send to
        users and channels.  The default command character is a "/" 
        (<a href="#hack_2">HACK 2</a>.)  You can use <b>tab completion</b> to
        finish your commands you start to type.  For example, type <tt>/d</tt>
        and press <tt>TAB</tt>, ChatZilla will respond by adding an <tt>e</tt>
        to your command, giving you <tt>/de</tt>.  This tells you that there are
        multiple commands that start with the letter "d", but they all have the
        second character "e".  To see the list of possible completions for
        <tt>/de</tt>, press <tt>TAB</tt> twice (quickly.)  ChatZilla should
        respond with <tt>``Commands matching ``de'' are 
        [delete, deop, desc, devoice]''</tt>.  Assuming you wanted to change
        your description you can continue by:
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>typing ``sc'' and pressing <tt>ENTER</tt>.
          <li>typing ``s'' and pressing <tt>TAB</tt>
          <li>typing ``s'' and pressing <tt>ENTER</tt>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Notice that to execute a ChatZilla command, it does not need to be
          complete, only unique.  Because there is no other command beginning
          with <tt>/des</tt>, it will automatically be interpreted as the
          <i>description</i> command.
        <p>
          When a channel view is active, tab completion works for nicknames as
          well.  If the word you are typing is the first word in the input box,
          and it does not start with the command character (``/'' by default)
          <tt>TAB</tt> will match against the list of nicknames
          for the channel.  When a match is found, the nickname will appear in
          you input box, with a ", " following it
          (<a href="#hack_3">HACK 3</a>.)  If the word you are typing is not the
          first word, a match will be suffixed with a single space.
          (ChatZilla assumes that if the nickname is the first word in the 
          input box, you are directly addressing that person and inserts
          the ", " because it wants to help;)
        <p>
      <li><b>Status Bar</b>
        <br>
        In channel views, the status bar shows details about the channel you're
        on.
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Network</b> is the network you are connected to.
          <li><b>Server</b> is the server (on the network) you are connected to.
          <li><b>Nickname</b> is your nickname.
          <li><b>Lag</b> is the number of seconds the server took to reply to
            the last ping ChatZilla sent (<a href="#hack_4">HACK 4</a>.)
          <li><b>Last Ping</b> the time (in 24 hour format) that the last
            ping request was received from the IRC server.
          <li><b>Channel</b> is the channel you're talking to.
          <li><b>Mode</b> is the mode of the current channel.
          <li><b>Users</b> is the number of users in the channel.
          <li><b>Limit</b> is the maximum number of users allowed on the 
            channel.
          <li><b>Key</b> is the key required to join the channel.
          <li><b>Topic by</b> is the nickname of the user who set the topic.
          <li><b>Topic</b> is the current topic of discussion for the channel.

    <h3>Hacks</h3>
    <p>
      Many ChatZilla users will not want to hear about this stuff, but if you're
      interested in what might happen in the future, want to add functionality
      to ChatZilla, or just like to muck around where you shouldn't be, these
      clues might help.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a name="hack_1"></a>
        <p>
          If you want to know more about the munger take a look at
          <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/xul/content/static.js#188">static.js</a>
          and
          <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/irc/xul/lib/munger.js">munger.js</a>

      <li>
        <a name="hack_2"></a>
        The command character is stored in the <tt>client.COMMAND_CHAR</tt>
        variable (it'll be a pref one of these days.)  You could change it 
        to be a ``bang'' (for example) by typing
        <tt>/eval client.COMMAND_CHAR = "!"</tt> in the input box.  Changing it
        to something longer than one character will give undefined results.

      <li>
        <a name="hack_3"></a>
        The characters appended to first-word nicknames which are
        tab completed are stored in the <tt>client.ADDRESSED_NICK_SEP</tt>
        variable.
        You can change this to ``: '' (for example) by typing 
        <tt>/eval client.ADDRESSED_NICK_SEP = ": "</tt> in the input box.
        This can be as many characters as you want.  (This needs to become a
        pref also.)
        
      <li>
        <a name="hack_4"></a>
        Most irc servers send out pings requests every few minutes, just to
        make sure your client is still alive.  When the IRC library used
        by ChatZilla hears one of these pings, it replys to the ping as expected
        and in addition sends out a ping request of it's own.  The number of
        seconds between when this ping request went to the server and when
        the reply is received the is reported as the Lag.
