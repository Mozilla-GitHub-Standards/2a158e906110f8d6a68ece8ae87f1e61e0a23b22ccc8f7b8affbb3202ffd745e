<h1>Who we are</h1>

<dl>
 <dt>Mostafa Hosseini, Project Leader ( mostafah AT axentra DOT com )</dt>
 <dd>
  Mostafa is responsible for the Sunbird project in general, managing and 
  building milestones, making decisions on releases, directing contributions 
  and making sure the outcome of efforts benefits the project both in its 
  extension form as well as its standalone version. He has been contributing 
  mostly to the backend code since the project started and has dedicated 
  most of his afterhour efforts to keeping Sunbird up-to-date with the route 
  of development the main codebase has followed; a non-stop fun-ride he has 
  experienced since he introduced the standalone calendar application shortly 
  after Firefox and Thunderbird had taken off.
  <p></p>
  Mostafa currently works at <a href="http://www.axentra.com">Axentra 
  (formerly OEone)</a> which has been benefiting from and promoting the 
  Mozilla project since the beginning and is the company which 
  <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/articles/article2069.html">donated 
  the Calendar code base on which Sunbird is based to Mozilla</a>.
 </dd>

 <dt>Michiel van Leeuwen, Developer ( mvl+moz AT exedo DOT nl )</dt>
 <dd>
  Michiel doesn't have an official role in the project. But he's a major 
  contributor to various parts of the codebase. He tends to work mostly on 
  backend stuff and got involved in the project because he got a Palm, and 
  wanted to use it with his linux desktop. When he is not hacking on the 
  Sunbird codebase, he also works on the Mozilla code for cookies and 
  permissions.
 </dd>

 <dt>Vladimir Vukicevic ( vladimir AT pobox DOT com)</dt>
 <dd>
  Vladimir is a major contributor to the project. His areas include
  maintaining the generic back-end infrastructure (Items, Events, etc.),
  recurrence objects and calculation, the mozStorage framework and the
  database calendar provider, as well as various bits of other back-end
  components.
  <p></p>
  When he finds the time Vladimir also hacks on other parts of the Mozilla 
  codebase, especially Mozilla Firefox, where he is also a major contributor.
 </dd>

 <dt>Dan Mosedale ( dmose AT mozilla DOT org)</dt>
 <dd>
  Having been part of mozilla.org since its inception, Dan has been
  involved in many different areas, including coding, toolsmithing,
  processes, and community-building. These days his work is largely
  focused on calendaring (where he is mostly working on the CalDAV 
  protocol implementation as well as basic calendar interfaces and 
  infrastructure) and Thunderbird.
  <p></p>
  Past work has included IT architecture at Netscape, co-authoring the
  DNS server used by Netscape for global distribution of its web site,
  Java parser hacking for processing.org, and a Python implementation 
  of a timeline tool for the Long Now Foundation. 
 </dd>

 <dt>Joey Minta (jminta AT gmail DOT com)</dt>
 <dd>
  Joey is a relative newcomer to the project. He tends to focus more 
  on the frontend of the code, as well as spending a significant
  amount of time roaming around Sunbird's Bugzilla. He became interested 
  in Sunbird during one of his many failed attempts to get his daily 
  schedule organized. In addition to his work on the Sunbird codebase, 
  his college life, with an eye towards law school, forms much of the 
  rest of the clutter in his schedule that still remains unorganized.
 </dd>

 <dt>Mark Carson, Graphic Artist ( Mark AT MarkCarson DOT com )</dt>
 <dd>
  Mark designed the Sunbird logo and along with Chris Cook (and a lot of 
  community input) created the default theme for Sunbird. His follow-on 
  effort was a theme for Thunderbird called "Winstripe Unofficial" where 
  he collaborated with Scratch to make a Thunderbird skin to complement 
  the default Firefox theme. He is currently designated as the 
  responsible party for Sunbird graphics (logo, icons, etc.).
  <p></p>
  His "day job" has very little to do with graphics. Outside of making an 
  odd logo or some icons for business or personal projects, he works as 
  a software engineering consultant and develops web-based applications 
  using JavaScript, JSP/Java, ASP, PHP and Lotus Domino/Notes. Mark is 
  an old 'C' programmer but hasn't compiled any code for 5 years other 
  than Java servlets/JSPs. He has lived in Hawaii for over a quarter of 
  a century and has been paid to do what he loves (coding, of course) 
  for over 15 years.
 </dd>

 <dt>Simon Paquet, Website Maintainer and Spokesman (bugzilla AT babylonsounds DOT com )</dt>
 <dd>
  Simon is responsible for the project website. He is also the project's 
  spokesman, because he tries to spread the word about new releases and 
  writes on the <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/calendar"> Calendar 
  weblog</a>, which is dedicated to the newest developments in the codebase. 
  Occasionally he also provides some patches, but since he really can't code, 
  his contributions to the codebase are always small and mostly trivial. 
  He became involved with the project when Mostafah announced Sunbird 
  for the first time. Before that he was a major contributor to the 
  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">Firefox</a> QA team.
  <p></p>
  Simon lives in Germany and works for a major professional services 
  firm as a risk management consultant.
