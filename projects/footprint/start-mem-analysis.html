    <h1>Memory usage observations</h1>
    <p align="center">by Bill Law, edited by Alec Flett &lt;<a href="mailto:alecf@flett.org">alecf@flett.org</a>&gt;</p>
    <cite>Editor's Note: This is a document from bill law which includes some followup comments by Chris Waterson. Chris's responses are interspursed throughout Bill's notes.</cite>
    
<p>The following are some observations which I think I can make after doing
quite a lot of ad hoc memory testing against the gtkEmbed browser on Linux
over the past few weeks.&nbsp; These conclusions have not been rigorously
tested but might provide food for thought.
<ul>
<li>
When I discovered the static in-house set of urls which John Morrison is
maintaining, and switched my focus to testing against them instead of live
urls from the outside, tests began making quite a lot more sense.
It seems that real world uses pages with more than enough "color" to make
results almost random.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Chris responds:</p>
    <blockquote type=cite>
<p> jrgm's 'static buster test
suite' is base on content from top sites. the list of sites that
he has
 captured and made copies of can
be found here if anyone else is interested in
 reproducing the content we will
be using in daily memory testing and reporting.
 <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/tools/footprint/lists/static41.list">http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/tools/footprint/lists/static41.list</a>
</blockquote>
    Bill writes:
<ul>
<li>
On the other hand, I wonder if it is really necassary for our browser
to become so unpredictable in memory consumption across live urls?
Is this because we are not handling memory usage wisely or is it unavoidable
given the nature of the beast?</li>
</ul>
    Chris responds:
<blockquote type=cite>
<p>Here is what a typical random URL list shows for memory consumption.
In this case we
consumed up to 50 MB's and topped off around 40MB's at the end of the
test run.
<p><img SRC="gdf2.png" height=480 width=640>
</blockquote>

    Bill writes:
<ul>
<li>
To get really consistant, reproducable results it is not only necassary
to hit static urls, but also to order the urls, either 1)from greatest
memory user to least, 2)visa versa or to 3)hit the same url over and over.
In these cases the test results become much more predictable and consistant
across all the data. Again, however, this is not going to be the
case in the real world!</li>
</ul>

    Chris responds:
    <blockquote type=cite>
<p>One theory to explore would be that fragmentation maybe greater
as the content we load becomes
        more varied and random...
    </blockquote>
    Bill writes:
<ul>
<li>
Hitting the same static url over and over generates almost a perfectly
linear growth with a slope consistantly &lt; 10K / url. In this case cnn.com
loaded 500 times in a row.</li>
</ul>

    Chris responds:
    <blockquote type=cite>
The next graph shows that we could actually control memory usage pretty
well if we could get users to
only load the same site over and over again... ;-) the
CNN site is actually on of the
biggest consumers of memory and the slope gets even flatter if we load
more
simple content.
<p><img SRC="gdf.png" height=480 width=640>
<p>The small hickups in the CNN graph appear to be the result of varied
content or periodic pop up
windows. Here is a graph of the exicite page loaded over and
over 500 times. The exicite content
has less variation and memory use is pretty much controled.
<p><img SRC="gdf.png" height=480 width=640>



    </blockquote>
    Bill writes:
<ul>
<li>
Ordered lists, either way, seem to be about as predicable with slightly
steeper slopes.</li>
</ul>

    Chris responds:
    <blockquote type=cite>
<p>Graph below shows 41 top sites loaded over 10 cycles. Each
of the 'peaks' shows the start of
a new cycle with one of the biggest memory consumers starting the greatest
to least cycle. Here
again we don't have the extremes of memory consumtion when loading
a random set of sites,
and overall consumption by the end of test is lower.
<p><img SRC="top41-10times.png" height=480 width=640>

        </blockquote>
    
    Bill writes:
<ul>
<li>
Hitting random sites (live or static) has a couple fairly consistant patterns
different from hitting ordered lists:</li>

<ul>
<li>
The slope of the resulting graph is usually much steeper over the initial
100 urls (70K/url??<b><font size=+1> </font></b>or more in many cases)
than over subsequent hits (seems to drop into the 10-20K+/url range after
100 urls). For ordered lists (apparently regardless of how they are
ordered) the graph seems to establish a slope and stick to it after the
first 5 or so urls.</li>

<li>
Even when slope levels off it is consistantly greater than for ordered
sites.</li>

<li>
Even though the average slope across 100 urls anywhere on the graph (after
the first 100 urls) is usual very consistant, there are RADICAL (~0K/url
to ~50K/url) swings in memory consumption over smaller subsections of the
graph.</li>
</ul>

<li>
The slope never seems to flatten out to zero. (I.e., there is always
some memory leakage going on?)</li>
</ul>

    Chris responds:
    <blockquote type=cite>
 leakage, or unbounded
cache and buffer sizes. waterson's working on trying to
 catalog all
the cache's and buffers system wide so we can turn all these off or
 control them
better to make leaks become more visible.
    </blockquote>
    Bill writes:
<ul>
<li>
Is it not fair to expect zero growth in memory conmption beyond some point
as an ultimate objective?</li>

<li>
I've not been able to run enough tests against the exact same urls to say
this with certainty but...it seems that even with static urls, tests run
back to back have "some" varience--maybe 10% or 20%--esp. in the slope
of the line (growth of memory comsumption). So in comparing daily
builds it may be hard to tell what is within standard varience vs. what
is introduced by or corrected in the new build.</li>

<li>
Even if average memory usage is kept within acceptable limits, spikes could
throw us out of range for systems where available memory is very limited.
Spikes regularly peak the memory at 5K (or more) greater than the average
at that time, i.e. ~20% spikes in memory usage.</li>

<li>
Memory consumed after 5 urls have been loaded is generally between 25K-35K.
(This seems like a pretty wide range to me.)</li>
</ul>
