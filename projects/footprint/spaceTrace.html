<h1>Using SpaceTrace to Inspect Footprint</h1>

 <br>

<h2></h2>
 
<h2>Introduction</h2>
 
<blockquote>What makes one allocation <i>footprint bloat</i> and another allocation
  <i>acceptable</i>? &nbsp;This is the question which prompted the creation
of SpaceTrace.<br>
   <br>
 In a project like mozilla, where millions of allocations are recorded by 
trace-malloc during a normal run of &nbsp;the application, browsing such a
large data set to find a culprit can be a fruitless task. &nbsp;Some method 
must be utilized to narrow the data set to a human level. &nbsp;Other trace-malloc 
genre tools exist to narrow the data. &nbsp;A user of these tools can display 
the number of different types of objects allocated, list the allocations that
were not freed, report where live allocations were created at a given point
in time, et. al.&nbsp; &nbsp;The one piece of information I was after was
still missing however; allocation lifespan.<br>
   <br>
 My answer to the prompting question:&nbsp; "long lived allocations contribute 
to footprint bloat, short lived allocations are acceptable". &nbsp;There need
be no mention of size, number, or type of allocation, but just simply how
long an allocation exists or lives.<br>
   <br>
 SpaceTrace is a tool which reads a trace-malloc output log and allows the 
user to browse all allocations recorded by trace-malloc in an interactive 
manner by accepting http requests. &nbsp;SpaceTrace intends to target allocations 
with longer lifespans contributing to footprint bloat. &nbsp;This targeting 
is done by sorting all allocations using the concept of weight (described 
below).<br>
   </blockquote>
   
  <h2>Main Concepts</h2>
   
  <blockquote>There are two concepts used throughout SpaceTrace which if explained
beforehand will make the understanding come easier.<br>
     <br>
 One concept is that of lifespan. &nbsp;The lifespan of an allocation can 
be determined by subtracting the time of destruction from the time of creation.
&nbsp;Once the allocation's lifespan has been garnered more interesting decisions
regarding the allocation can take place. &nbsp;The composite lifespan from
first creation to final destruction is known; that interval is assumed to
be the total run time of the application.<br>
     <br>
 Another concept is that of weight. &nbsp;An allocation's weight is the product 
of the allocation's size and the allocation's lifespan (weight = size * lifespan). 
&nbsp;While an allocation's weight is often a very large number, you should 
immediately gloss over the digits and look directly at the lifetime and size 
of the allocation. &nbsp;The allocation's weight is meant to represent how 
much the allocation contributed to overall footprint bloat and &nbsp;by default 
all lists are sorted by weight in SpaceTrace.<br>
     </blockquote>
     
    <h2>Configuring, Building, Running</h2>
     
    <blockquote>Skip this section if you are only interested in using a dedicated 
server hosting SpaceTrace. &nbsp;Information on were to find such a server 
is beyond the scope of this document.<br>
       <br>
 The mozilla build system by default does not have trace-malloc enabled by 
default. &nbsp;Perform the following platform specific instructions to get 
a trace-malloc build in order to use SpaceTrace.<br>
       <br>
       
      <h3>WIN32</h3>
       
      <blockquote>Follow normal win32 debug build instructions, with the
following environment variable enabled:<br>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>set MOZ_TRACE_MALLOC=1<br></pre>
          </blockquote>
After your mozilla build completes, should you have <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd">
http://www.boutell.com/gd</a>
 installed, SpaceTrace is capable of producing some useful graphs. &nbsp;This
step is totally optional. &nbsp;I had to jump through a few hoops to get
the library compiled with the various other libraries it wants, with the
correct LIBC (/MDd), and to use Mozilla's zlib_s.lib. &nbsp;Other than those
hangups, set the following environment variable to the directory where the
build system can find gd.lib and the appropriate gd headers:<br>
          <blockquote>set HAVE_BOUTELL_GD=C:\gd-1.8.4<br>
            </blockquote>
The tools to analyze trace-malloc output are not checked out or built by
default. &nbsp;From the parent directory of your existing mozilla source
tree:<br>
            <blockquote>
              <pre>cvs checkout mozilla/tools/trace-malloc<br>cd mozilla\tools\trace-malloc<br>nmake /f makefile.win<br></pre>
              </blockquote>
From your dist bin directory (i.e. mozilla/dist/WIN32_D.OBJ/bin), you can
use the following commands to execute mozilla to produce trace-malloc output,
and once through running, to execute SpaceTrace to examine the data:<br>
              <blockquote>
                <pre>mozilla.exe --trace-malloc=C:\TEMP\TM.LOG<br>spacetrace.exe C:\TEMP\TM.LOG<br></pre>
                </blockquote>
Once SpaceTrace has loaded the data (could take a while depending on your
machine), a message stating connections are being accepted on port 1969.
&nbsp;Simply point your everyday browser to <a href="http://localhost:1969/">
http://localhost:1969/</a>
 to view the SpaceTrace reports interactively.<br>
                </blockquote>
         
                <h3>Linux</h3>
         
                <blockquote>From the parent directory of your existing mozilla
source tree:<br>
           
                  <blockquote>             
                    <pre>cvs checkout mozilla/tools/trace-malloc<br></pre>
             </blockquote>
 From the root of your mozilla source tree:<br>
             
                    <blockquote>               
                      <pre>./configure --enable-cpp-rtti --enable-trace-malloc --disable-debug --enable-optimize="-O -g"<br></pre>
               </blockquote>
 Should you have <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd">http://www.boutell.com/gd</a>
  installed, SpaceTrace is capable of producing some useful graphs. &nbsp;My 
redhat linux 7.1 workstation installation already had the required files (/usr/lib/libgd.a).
&nbsp;Set the following environment variable in whatever way you normally
use:<br>
               
                      <blockquote>                 
                        <pre>export HAVE_BOUTELL_GD=1<br></pre>
                 </blockquote>
 From the root of your mozilla source tree:<br>
                 
                        <blockquote>                   
                          <pre>make<br></pre>
                   </blockquote>
 Once the build completes, it is time to create the trace-mallloc output
log. &nbsp;From you mozilla/dist/bin directory, you will start mozilla with
a special command line argument. &nbsp;Be aware that the log file produced 
may range well into the hundreds of megabytes; be sure to use a partition 
with enough space. &nbsp;Once mozilla starts, perform whatever tasks that 
will be of interest to you, and then normally close the application. &nbsp;Perform 
the desired actions as quickly as possible as the trace-malloc output log 
tends to fill up even during an idle state.<br>
                   
                          <blockquote>                     
                            <pre>./mozilla --trace-malloc=/tmp/tm.log<br></pre>
                     </blockquote>
 Next you should be ready to have SpaceTrace process the log. &nbsp;Type
the following commands from the mozilla/dist/bin directory. &nbsp;The LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
is needed as SpaceTrace utilizes NSPR.<br>
                     
                            <blockquote>                       
                              <pre>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.<br>./spacetrace /tmp/tm.log<br></pre>
                       </blockquote>
 Once the tool has finished loading the data, a message stating that SpaceTrace 
is accepting connections on port 1969 will be displayed. &nbsp;Simply point 
your everyday browser to <a href="http://localhost:1969/">http://localhost:1969/</a>
  to view the SpaceTrace reports interactively.<br>
                       </blockquote>
                       </blockquote>
                       
                              <h2>Available Reports</h2>
                       
                              <blockquote>Upon loading the SpaceTrace Index,
you are presented with some very plain machine generated HTML. &nbsp;All
the pages you visit while interactively using SpaceTrace are generated on

                         <br>
 A description of the reports you encounter and their intended meaning are 
listed below. &nbsp;Note that the image graphs will not be present unless 
image support was turned on during the build process.<br>
                         <br>

                                     <br>
 This graph is a bit hard to understand at first glance. &nbsp;The important 
thing to note is that the X axis is the lifespan of an allocation, not the 
total run interval of the application.<br>
                                     <br>
 You may notice that the short lived allocations do not show up; by default 
SpaceTrace ignores allocations that do not at least have a lifespan of 10 
seconds (configurable in the options should these be of interest to you).<br>
                                     <br>
 This graph is most useful for obtaining information for tuning the options 
to target allocations which lived a particular amount of time.<br>

                                       <br>

                                              <h3>Allocation Weights Graph</h3>
                                       
                                              <blockquote>Nearly identical
to the Allocation Times Graph, except that the Y axis is weight as opposed 
to size.<br>

footprint bloat allocations took place.<br>
                                         <br>
 While a hard to digest graph, this is considered by me to be the most important 
graph generated by SpaceTrace. &nbsp;The graph can be more useful after having 
narrowed the data set via the options.<br>

 Feedback on SpaceTrace has been very positive. However I observed users
of the tool encountering information overload, and they often end up asking 
themselves "what am I looking at?". &nbsp;In defense, SpaceTrace and trace-malloc 
help answer the question of "where is the bloat?", every allocation and every 
detail is right there in front of the user, but <i>the brutal reality is that
millions of allocations and all the details presented to the user will eventually
cause blurred vision</i>.<br>

 In order to maximize your experience, you have to use the options to narrow 
the data set to something more relevant to you. &nbsp;There are some dangers 
in doing this if in a multiple user scenario (see Implementation Issues). 
&nbsp;Only through use and familiarity can you begin to mine relevant information.<br>

The number one option to consider is -c&lt;text&gt;. &nbsp;If you happen
to know the creation routine or a central pathway to the code you are responsible
for, by all means set the option to restrict only reporting that data to
yourself. &nbsp;Things will make a lot more sense and be a lot more relevant
to you if you do.<br>

 The current incarnation of SpaceTrace is a C source file; this is acceptable 
so long as the abilities of the program keep up with the demands of the people 
using it.<br>
                                                                                    <br>
One area of concern will be the plain HTML and large tables used to present
the data. &nbsp;Please, if you have the means, feel free to improve the presentation
to your liking. &nbsp;I am no expert in such details and was only interested
in getting the data into the hands of the people that need it.<br>
                                                                                    <br>
Futher, the lack of graphs on the platforms without GD will eventually be
a hinderance, and some simple tables with colored cell backgrounds could
represent the same data but in a rougher format. &nbsp;If you have the means,
again, please feel free to help out.<br>
                                                                        
  <br>
Perhaps the biggest issue, one other area of concern is the options effect
the entire SpaceTrace process in a global sweeping manner. &nbsp;As a disclaimer,
the tool was originally written with only a single user in mind; &nbsp;in
my perfect little world each developer would run the tool at their leisure
inspecting their own trace-malloc output files. &nbsp;I soon discovered that
with a large trace-malloc output file SpaceTrace will grow in memory usage
significantly. &nbsp;Alas, the number of machines capable of running SpaceTrace 
with adequate performance waned and ideas of hosting the data on dedicated
machines obviously sprung to mind. &nbsp;In a multiple user scenario, this
dubious shared options feature will likely lead to some red herrings while
the data set changes beneath the users' feet with no warning. &nbsp;On the
flip side, a user can then point random people to the server without any
trouble and have them see what was intended. &nbsp;I would be lying if I
said correcting the behavior would be easy. &nbsp;Giving each client their
own view of the data set will be hard to implement in the C code because
of some of the data stamping and caching code I wrote. &nbsp;The issue can
be corrected in time, but then I truly wonder about the performance aspects
of such a tool where cache misses are common and each page view could cause
many millions of iterations.... &nbsp;I need to mention the code is single
threaded, though I think a multiple thread transition would be attainable 
by almost anyone.<br>
                                                                        
  <br>
 For now, a usage pattern must emerge to minimize the effects of the implementation. 
&nbsp;I suggest that the options URL with appropriate GET form data be copied 
and pasted into bug reports, emails, or other messages before the actual URL
of interest. &nbsp;In this manner, you can ensure that the recipient can
load the desired options when they want to view the data.<br>
                                                                        
  <br>
 Onward to an answer, I believe real power of SpaceTrace will be in allowing 
users of the tool to have their own custom queries performed on the data set.
&nbsp;The final solution seems obvious, but as there is a lack of time to
go back and do things right I will document my simple thoughts here in the
hopes one day someone will pick up the torch.<br>
                                                                        
  <br>
 The trace-malloc output file combined with the SpaceTrace reader of that 
file should insert their datum into a database such as MySQL. &nbsp;Some time
will have to be spent architecting the various database tables involved, but
the concepts should mostly follow what is there today in the C data structures. 
&nbsp;A web front end written in a scripting language such as PHP could then 
be written for casual users of the data not unlike what is provided today 
in the C version. More formal users could write their own database queries 
using dedicated tools or by hand. &nbsp;An entire barrage of automated reports 
could be written, a veritable dream when you need to track footprint and publish
the results to a community like mozilla.<br>

 The only code in SpaceTrace that is possibly specific to mozilla, restricting 
SpaceTrace usage on other projects, is the format of trace-malloc output to
be parsed. &nbsp;Should you intend to use SpaceTrace on a project other than
mozilla, you need to either output data in a compatible trace-malloc format
(easier) or put a new parser into SpaceTrace (harder).<br>
