-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Removal of nsFileSpec and related classes from the xpcom library.

Updated many callers using the obsolete nsFile spec to use nsIFile and 
Necko to do file IO.  (timeless did the plugin patch – we need to review 
this patch more exhaustively.)

Created a new (optional) library that contains nsFileSpec and related 
classes.

Removed libreg from xpcom.  This library now lives in the profile manager.

Combined the following DLLs (source -> dest)
   uriloader -> docshell
   shistory -> docshell
   jsurl -> jsdom
   gkview -> gklayout

Moved nsAdapterEnumerator out of xpcom/ds and into mailnews, since 
they're the only consumer

Modifed the xpt_link tool so that you can specify a “only include” cid 
list that can mask CID’s that you are not interested in.

Added a build option:
Prevent the building of xpinstall (--disable-xpcom)
Prevent the building js component loader (--disable-jsloader)
A build option to only build a single profile (--enable-single-profile)
Added a option to only build select protocols 
(--enable-protocols=http,file,res,jar)
Added build flag to control network caching (--disable-disk-cache 
–disable-dns-cache)
A build flag to only built the required xpfe components 
(--disable-xpfe-components).

Resurrected the INCLUDE_XUL and renamed it MOZ_XUL.  This allows you to 
disable most parts of XUL.

Landed nsIPromptService implementation for gtk embedding

Removal or hiding of unused functions and classes including nsEscape*, 
nsDequeIterator, nsRecyclingAllocatorImpl, nsDiscriminatedUnion, 
nsOpaqueKey, nsCRT::strlen, NS_NewCommandLineService


Alec plans on a few more consolidations, for deCOMification work
   gkgfx -> gklayout
   gkwidget -> gklayout
