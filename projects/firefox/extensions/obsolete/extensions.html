      <li>A New Take On Extensions</li>
      <li>Conclusion</li>

    </ol>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Mozilla's two new applications, Firebird and Thunderbird, support user-
       installable optional components called <strong>extensions</strong> that
       adapt or enhance application functionality in various ways. Extensions
       are easy to create, usually tailored to a specific task, usually written
       in JavaScript and XUL, and as a result are mostly small, managable 
       compnents. </p>
       
    <p>Nonetheless, extension authors and users have uncovered some problems 
       with the current setup. These include:</p>
       
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lack of an uninstall capability</strong> - Extensions once
          installed cannot be automatically uninstalled by the system, only
          disabled. This results in cruft in the Extensions list, and in the
          install folder.</li>

      <li><strong>Extensions overwrite critical files</strong> - some 
          Extensions overwrite critical application files with their own 
          versions, causing problems and incompatibilities when users update
          other parts of the application. The classic example of this is
          Tabbrowser Extensions, which constantly breaks in nightly builds
          (basically any time the file that it overwrites changes from
          under it). </li>
      <li><strong>Extensions incompatible between application versions break
          the application</strong> - when you upgrade from Application vN to
          Application vN+1, code changes in the application can cause extensions
          to stop working, however the extensions are still loaded despite
          unknown compatibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Difficulty installing extensions into non-browser 
          applications</strong> - Users of applications that aren't a browser, 
          like Thunderbird, have a difficult time installing extensions since
          there is no easy way to install from the browser. Most often the 
          user is forced to download the extension through a browser as a XPI 
          file and then use cumbersome UI in the target application to actually
          install it.</li>
      <li><strong>Extension authors must place files in system 
          locations</strong> - Certain file types, such as XPCOM components and
          preferences defaults files must be placed in specific locations in
          order to be recognized by the application framework. This makes
          identification and removal of extension components more difficult.</li>

      <li><strong>It is difficult to manage and maintain installed 
          extensions</strong> - Given the nature of extensions, new versions are
          constantly available. It is often difficult or cumbersome to keep
          track and update installed extensions. Users must manually identify
          and install newer versions of extensions, which may or may not be
          compatible with the current application version.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These changes call for a series of changes to the way extensions are
       handled.
    
    <h2>A New Take on Extensions</h2>
    
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To make it easy to install compatible extensions in any new Mozilla
          app from any web browser.</li>

      <li>To make it easy to uninstall extensions completely.</li>
      <li>To maximize flexibility for extension authors in the types of files
          that they can provide.</li>
      <li>To prevent outdated extensions from breaking the application.</li>
      <li>To provide a scheme to keep extensions and other application 
          components up-to-date.</li>
      <li>To design a system to facilitate the above that is forward 
          compatible.</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>Installing Extensions From A Browser</h3>
    <p>Currently extensions for all browsers bear the xpi file extension and 
       are identified as application/x-xpinstall. There is no discrimination
       between intended target application.</p>
       
    <p>The proposed solution is to create a variant of the xpinstall content
       type for each extension consumer, like so:</p>
    
    <p><code>
        application/x-xpinstall;type=extension&app=firebird
        application/x-xpinstall;type=extension&app=thunderbird
        application/x-javaarchive;type=skin&app=firebird
        application/x-javaarchive;type=skin&app=firebird
       </code></p>

       
    <p>When an application is installed, it creates a listing in the system 
       MIME registry associating itself as a handler for that type.</p>
    <p>For example, when Firebird is installed on Windows, it creates several 
       keys in the Windows Registry - one associating 
       <code>application/x-xpinstall;type=extension&app=firebird</code> with
       the Firebird executable and another associating an extension (e.g.
       .fbext) with that content type. This means that the file will be 
       appropriately handled not only when invoked via a link click from any
       browser (Firebird, IE, Opera etc), but also when invoked from the 
       system shell (e.g. a double click on a .fbext file in Explorer).</p>
    <p class="apichange">The effect on extension authors is that they would
       need to give distinct file extensions to their extension installers, 
       as defined by each application. Distribution sites would need to
       send the correct content-type for each extension target application.</p>
    
    <h3>Supporting Uninstall</h3>
    <p>There have been proposals restricting extensions to one file or one 
       specific set of files in order to make extension uninstallation easier.
       The proposal here is that any xpinstall install operation should be
       reversable via a log that is created when the xpi file is installed.</p>

    <p>Every operation performed in a xpi's install.js file should append
       an entry to the log, which creates a manifest that can be used to
       uninstall the xpi later on. Files can be removed, backups restored
       (when files are replaced), registry keys unset and such like. </p>
    <p>This proposal does not go as far as dictating where this log would 
       be stored or what format it would assume, although it is intended that
       the log would be atomically written after the successful completion
       of each xpinstall command, and that this would be built into the 
       xpinstall implementation of the various install commands.</p>
    <p class="apichange">Little or no change would be required by the extension
       author. If the install log were kept with the installed files (which
       may be necessary in multi-user systems) then an additional function
       call at the commencement of the installation may be necessary to 
       identify the log file.</p>
    
    <h3>Keeping Extension Files Together</h3>
    <p>To rectify the problem of extensions overwriting or tampering with 
       core system files, extension files should be stored in a location
       separate from other application files. The proposed structure is:</p>
    <p><strong>For Application Directory Extensions</strong>:<br><br>

       <code>
         bin/extensions/&lt;extension_name&gt;/chrome/<br>
         bin/extensions/&lt;extension_name&gt;/components/<br>
         bin/extensions/&lt;extension_name&gt;/preferences/<br>

       </code></p>
    <p><strong>For Profile Directory Extensions</strong>:<br><br>
       <code>
         &lt;profile_dir&gt;/extensions/&lt;extension_name&gt;/chrome/<br>
         &lt;profile_dir&gt;/extensions/&lt;extension_name&gt;/components/<br>

         &lt;profile_dir&gt;/extensions/&lt;extension_name&gt;/preferences/<br>
       </code></p>
       
    <p>The component registry and preferences systems are updated to scan for
       components and defaults files in these locations for installed and
       enabled extensions.</p>
       
    <p>This mechanism gives extensions full flexibility into the kind of 
       functionality they can provide.</p>
       
    <p><strong>Directory Scan Path Precedence</strong> - One question raised by 
       the above proposal is the precedence in which files are loaded. In order
       to prevent extension dlls from clobbering core application files, the
       precedence would seem to be: System Components, Profile Extensions 
       Components, System Extensions Components.
       
    <h3>Extension Versioning</h3>

    <p>To prevent extensions designed for older versions of applications from
       causing problems, they should only be loaded if the application version
       falls within the range supported by the extension. An extension can 
       identify itself as supporting a range of versions by using the 
       <code>minAppVersion</code> and <code>maxAppVersion</code> properties on
       its package contents.rdf chrome registry entry. The version scheme works
       like this:</p>
    <p><code>MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION.MAINTENANCE_VERSION</code></p>   
    <p>For example, 0.6.1 (maintenance update to 0.6) is less than 0.8 (minor 
       version 0.8) is less than 1.3.1 (maintenance update to 1.3). A special
       case is for extensions targeting trunk development builds between releases,
       in which case the appropriate version string assumes the form:</p>
    <p><code>MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION+</code></p>

    <p>+ indicates trunk development <em>following</em> MINOR_VERSION, e.g.
       0.7+ indicates trunk development after 0.7</p>
    <p>When the application is started, the extensions list is enumerated 
       and if the app version falls outside the supported range of any extension
       that extension is disabled (and the update mechanism is invoked). If the
       extension is disabled for this reason, an annotation is placed in the
       extension's entry in the chrome registry preventing it from being enabled
       in this version, and identifying the extension as being disabled because
       of a compatibility problem.</p>
    
    <h3>Extension Updating</h3>
    <p>Extension Updating is a mechanism for determining if there are newer 
       compatible extension versions available from the web. This is useful if
       either the user wants to stay on the cutting edge of their favorite 
       set of extensions, or the user updates to a newer version of the application
       and the old set of extensions needs to be updated. These two use cases
       are outlined below.</p>
    
    <h4>Manual Invokation</h4>

    <p>The user will be able to periodically check for updates to the application
       and installed extensions, or check on demand. When one of these events
       occurs, a list of installed extensions and their versions is sent to the 
       extension server and the server matches those with the versions it has 
       available. If newer versions are available it responds with a list of
       available updates. The current application version is sent with the list 
       to ensure that the retrieved list is compatible.</p>
    
    <h4>Compatibility Invokation</h4>
    <p>When a new version of the application is installed, all incompatible 
       extensions are annotated as described above. This list is sent to the
       server as in the Manual Invokation case, the user is notified and given
       the option to visit the extension server where he or she will be presented
       with a list of available upates to install.</p>

    <p>As long as there are incompatible versions in the chrome registry, the
       system will periodically check the extension server for new, compatible
       versions.</p>
       
    <p><strong>Note</strong> - if the incompatible version installed is of the
       same extension version number as the compatible version on the server, 
       no download is performed, the local incompatible version's maximum 
       application version value is incremented to that of the compatible version
       from the server's. This is for the case where an old extension continues
       to work with a newer version of the application, and the author simply
       updates its compatibility information on the server.</p>

    
    <h3>Web Front End - User Level</h3>
    <p>The Web Front End is designed to show extensions for Mozilla applications
       that are compatible. The Web FE will be part of a larger software update
       mechanism that will be hosted on 
       <a href="http://update.mozilla.org/">update.mozilla.org</a>. The Web FE 
       will at minimum have the following elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A menu listing applications that extensions are available for, 
          defaulting to Firebird.</li>
      <li>In the Firebird section, if the user is using Firebird, a list of
          extensions compatible with that installed version, alternately 
          a selector is presented defaulting to the most recent release
          that filters the list. This setting is remembered with a cookie.</li>
      <li>Extension entries in this list, composed of Extension Name, Extension 
          Author, Extension Homepage, Extension Version, Extension Description, 
          Extension File Size, 
          Extension Last Update Date, Extension Install Icon, Compatibility 
          range (see above), and an install link. If the user is using Firebird
          to install an extension into Firebird, the XPInstall link will be a 
          XPInstall js api link featuring the Extension icon as metadata, otherwise
          it will be a link to the extension file, which will be handled by the
          system's native content type dispatch. (e.g. .tbext invokes Thunderbird.
          See above.)</li>

      <li>The Web FE must be capable of showing a list that only includes a named
          set of extensions, as required by the Update section above. For example, 
          if the user has extensions A, B and C installed, and chooses to check for
          updates, if B and C have newer versions available, a query to the 
          update server should result in a list containing the newer versions of 
          B and C being shown. This will also be used in the compatibility check
          when a new version of an application is installed, see above also.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Web FE will optionally (hopefully) have these elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Categories</strong> - categories of extension for each application.
          An extension might fit into more than one category. Categories can be
          used as filters on the extension list.</li>
      <li><strong>Ratings</strong> - a rating mechanism that lets users rate an
          extension using a graphical meter out of 5 stars.</li>

      <li><strong>Forums</strong> - each extension should have its own mini forum
          for user comments.</li>
      <li><strong>Search</strong> - the text of the extension name and description text
          at least should be searchable.</li>
      <li><strong>Best Rated</strong> - Sort by best rated, most popular, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Essentials</strong> - Editorial team features best extension.</li>

    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Important</strong> - the important areas of difference between this
       system and the current implementation on extensionroom are that the list
       shown is for one app only at any given time and that the list shown is only
       of extensions compatible with a specific version.</p>
    
    <h3>Web Front End - Author Level</h3>
    <p>Each extension author will have his or her own account with the extension
       service. Rather than being maintained by a central authority the extension
       list will be updated by authors. Approval by a moderator may be required
       for new account requests.</p>
    
    <p>The system should allow authors to create an account with an email address
       and a password, and their name. They will then be able to add as many extensions
       as they want to this account, each extension will appear in the list for the
       applicable application.</p>
       
    <p>When adding an extension, the author will be asked for the following 
       information:</p>

       
    <ul>
      <li>Extension Name (string)</li>
      <li>Extension Version (version_string)</li>
      <li>Target Application (enumeration value, pick from list)</li>
      <li>Target Application Version Range (from: version_string to: version_string)</li>
      <li>Extension Homepage URL (string)</li>

      <li>Extension Install Icon URL (string)</li>
      <li>Extension File (string via File Upload Control)</li>
      <li>Categories (check list)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The user will be able to see a list of his or her extensions when they log in,
       and will be able to edit details. For instance, if a new version of the application
       is released and extension X is still compatible with the new version, the author
       will be able to log in and increase the upper bound on the Target Application Version
       Range field so that users of the newer application version will be able to continue
       using compatible older versions of extensions.</p>
    
    <p>The advantages of this author-based system is that the author is empowered 
       to make changes and update extension files when they become available. Also, 
       the author can maintain several versions of the same extension for different 
       versions of the application (e.g. 1.0 vs. 1.3+)</p>
