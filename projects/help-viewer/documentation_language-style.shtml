<p>When a program malfunctions, the end user has no idea what has happened.  He
  may not even realize anything <em>has</em> happened.  One action the end user
  will likely take is to seek help on his situation through websites and Help
  documentation.  Given the crucial role that Help documentation can play in
  aiding and retaining an inexperienced user, Help documents must be uniform,
  accurate, and concise.  These guidelines describe how to consistently and
  clearly write Help documentation; this will keep Help documents uniform,
  accurate, and succinct.</p>

<h2><a name="purpose">Purpose</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of any help document is to succinctly explain how something
  works. Manuals do this through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clear, structured instruction,</li>
  <li>Helpful graphics, and</li>
  <li>Useful information</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally, the Help documents of all Mozilla programs strive for these goals.
  Help documents cannot be useful if they are not consistently and clearly
  written.  By setting a standard writing style, Help documents will become more
  cohesive and clear.  This should keep Help documentation better serving its
  purpose: instructing end users on how to use mozilla.org programs.</p>

<h2><a name="mozilla_guide">Overall Mozilla Guidelines</a></h2>

<p>There are no explicit Mozilla guidelines to follow.  In keeping with app
  consistency, however, Help documents <strong>must</strong> conform with the
  text of the user interface.  This means that spellings for terms, term names,
  and the information covered in the UI must be consistent.  While information
  covered will be a constant issue, term names and spellings are easily
  corrected.  <a href="#terms">Term standardizations</a> are listed below.</p>

<h2><a name="voice">Voice</a></h2>
<p>Help documentation should be enabling, authoritative, and friendly.  It
  should seek to give the user the knowledge to solve his problems.  When
  explaining or enumerating tasks, help documentation should speak of what the
  user can do or what the program lets the user do.  Avoiding the use of
  <a href="http://webster.commnet.edu/grammar/passive.htm">passive voice</a> is
  also nearly always a good idea for similar reasons.  It should never sound
  uncertain (a certain amount of <em>choice</em> is of course acceptable).  It
  should be simply written in a slightly formal yet conversational manner.  What
  this means practically is that direct reference to the user is acceptable and
  expected, while direct references to the author/speaker shouldn't be used.</p>

<p>When referring to the program, never use a generic term when the product name
  will do (e.g., "Mozilla Firefox" instead of "the browser").  Additionally, use
  the product's formal name only in topic introduction and more prominent
  places.  Reinforcing branding ("Mozilla Firefox") is preferable for the most
  visible locations, while shortness ("Firefox") is preferable if possible in
  other locations for succinctness. (Please note that usually some method exists
  for entering the program's name without directly typing it &mdash; currently
  Help documentation uses entities &mdash; such as &amp;brandShortName; and
  &amp;brandFullName; &mdash; to encode product names.</p>

<p>Also, to avoid description rot, never mention anything in a time-dependent
  manner.  For example, "new" features will not always remain "new", and
  "planned" features (hopefully) will not always remain "planned".  These things
  make Help documentation rot, and such references have become bugs at least
  once already in docs.</p>

<h2><a name="links">Links</a></h2>
<p>Link texts should make sense out of context.  In essence this means that if a
  list of all the links in a page were made, each link would directly connect
  with the target of the link.  In particular, the phrase "click here" must
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere">never be used</a>.  Giving
  links relevant text makes them easier to distinguish from the rest of the
  document and aids interpretation by screen readers and other such programs.
  Links may have <code>title</code> attributes if desired, but they are not
  required.</p>

<h2><a name="terms">Terms</a></h2>
<p>Some of these terms may be specific to one application.  For example,
  Bookmarks Toolbar is Firefox-specific, so the Mozilla Suite may continue to
  use Personal Toolbar.  In such cases please use the app-preferred term. In all
  cases the current user interface is the ultimate reference; if you happen to
  discover a conflict, please <a href="feedback">let us know</a>
  immediately.  If a term is not in the user interface and you believe it
  deserves to be standardized, <a href="feedback">let us know about this</a>
  as well.  If your term does not fit any of these situations, use the more
  cutting-edge version if it has gained
  <a href="http://www.google.com/">substantial usage</a>.</p>

<p>Any changes and additions to this list will be posted here as they occur.</p>

<h2><a name="mechanics">Mechanics</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, always use proper grammar and spelling. While many
  users will not notice a difference, the more educated users among our target
  audience whose opinions should be particularly respected will notice when
  "it's" is incorrectly used instead of "its".  Such mistakes are usually
  trivial, but they tend to easily irritate when present and are unprofessional.
  If you are at all unsure of the mechanics of your Help contributions, someone
  can always review your changes and additions to ensure correctness.</p>
