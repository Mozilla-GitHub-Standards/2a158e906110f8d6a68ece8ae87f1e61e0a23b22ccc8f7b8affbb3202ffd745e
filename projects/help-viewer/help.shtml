    <h1>How You Can Help</h1>

    <h2><a name="talk">Talk to Us</a></h2>
    <p>Members of the Help Viewer Project often hang around in the <a
      href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/documentation">#documentation channel</a> on
      the mozilla.org <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> server. (If
      you're using SeaMonkey, clicking on the link should take you to the
      channel. If you're running Firefox, <a
      href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/16/">Chatzilla</a>
      is the easiest way to get onto IRC.)  While you won't always find people
      talking, there's usually a decent supply of people just hanging around.
      Ask questions &mdash; if we can help you help us, we will!</p>

    <p>For offline discussion, use the <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/mozilla.dev.documentation">mozilla.dev.documentation</a>
      newsgroup.</p>

    <h2>Write Help Documents</h2>
    <p>Take your pick from among the following applications:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Firefox</dt>
      <dd>We've managed to ship each of the past releases of Firefox with
        up-to-date documentation. But there are still topics we haven't documented
        at all, for example Bookmarks and Live Bookmarks, or Page Info. The
        <a href="bugs">bugs page</a> has links for searching for existing and
        filing new bugs.</dd>
      <dt>Thunderbird</dt>
      <dd>Thunderbird Help is still in an early stage. The documentation
        effort is taking place at the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Thunderbird:Help_Documentation:Base">Thunderbird
        Help section</a> of the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/">Mozilla wiki</a>.
        Please have a look and make your contributions. It's a wiki, so go ahead and make changes
        &mdash; you don't need to ask permission first.</dd>
      <dt>Calendar/Sunbird</dt>
      <dd>A separate project for this exists at the <a
        href="http://calendarhelp.mozdev.org/">calendarhelp project on
        Mozdev</a>.  You should check there to see what's needed and how you can
        help.</dd>
      <dt>SeaMonkey</dt>
      <dd>Check in <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/documentation">#documentation</a>
        to see what needs to be done.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Hack the Help Viewer</h2>
    <p>Since SeaMonkey has moved to Toolkit on trunk, it is using the same Help
      Viewer as Firefox. It's pretty stable, but it's got its bugs. View the
      <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?product=Toolkit&amp;component=Help+Viewer&amp;resolution=---">current
      list of Help Viewer bugs</a>, make a note saying you plan to work on it
      in the bug, and get started.</p>

    <h2>Do I Need to Know a Programming Language?</h2>
    <p>Absolutely not!  Much of what we do consists of writing documentation,
      and while what we write is eventually turned into <abbr title="Extensible
      Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, there's no reason we won't accept
      help simply because it's not in the correct format.  We'd prefer something
      that's easy to parse, however &mdash; if <abbr>HTML</abbr> isn't your
      thing, regular <code class="filename">*.txt</code> files are probably next
      best.</p>
    <p>You can also help with quality assurance for our documentation &mdash;
      just pick up a build of your favorite application and look for things you
      don't like or that you don't think are good enough.  Finally, if you think
      you might want to do something else related to Help, just
      <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/#documentation">swing by IRC</a> and
      hopefully someone can give you some pointers.</p>

    <h2><a name="hack-docs">What Would Be Good to Know?  (To Write Documentation)</a></h2>
    <p>Well, the first thing that would be good to know is how to get the current
      documentation in the source code tree.  To do so you'll need the cvs program.
      If you're on Linux, cvs is probably on the install disks for your
      distribution or is available in convenient package form for download.  If
      you're not, do a Google search for it &mdash; it's not difficult to find.
      Once you have cvs installed on your system so that it can be run with the
      command <code class="command">cvs</code>, run:</p>

    <pre class="code">cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot co mozilla/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/help mozilla/suite/locales/en-US/chrome/common/help</pre>

    <p>...to get the latest source code.  You'll want to run this command to
      update your source code in the future.</p>
    <p>Another good place to look is the <a href="./content_packs">content pack
      specification</a>.  This document describes exactly how applications create
      help content for display by the Help viewer, and it describes things in
      pretty good detail.  You'll want to know how these things work so that you
      add entries to the index, table of contents, and glossary for whichever
      application's Help you want to hack.</p>
    <p>Beyond that, there's not much else.  Learn <abbr>HTML</abbr>, grasp the
      basics of the formats for the table of contents, index, and glossary, and
      start making changes with your favorite text editor.</p>

    <h2>What Would Be Good to Know?  (To Hack the Help Viewer)</h2>
    <p>First, see <a href="#hack-docs">the previous answer</a>.  You'll also
      need to look at the <a href="../../build/">Build Instructions</a>, because
      you'll be building some application in order to test that your fixes work
      correctly.  (This will involve getting a few more build tools beyond just
      <code class="command">cvs</code>.)  Beyond that, you'll be looking at code
      in either <code class="filename">extensions/help</code> or
      <code class="filename">toolkit/components/help</code>.  From there, it's
      mostly up to you until we get some better documentation here or link to it.
      Learn <abbr title="Extensible UI Language">XUL</abbr>, <abbr
      title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript as it's used in
      Help.  It's more up to you at this point, because that's the best way to
      get people who are committed to helping us.  (See also <a
      href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/documentation">#documentation</a> if you need
      further tips &mdash; at least until we get more docs here.)</p>
