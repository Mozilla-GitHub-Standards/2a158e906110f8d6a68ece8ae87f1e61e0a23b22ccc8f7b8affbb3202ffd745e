<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>grendel database requirements
<BR><FONT SIZE="3">by <a href="mailto:terry@mozilla.org">Terry Weissman</A>
<BR>16-Oct-1997
</FONT></H1>

<P>Note: this does not include address book needs! <A
HREF="mailto:lesters">Lester Schueler</A> is working on a separate document
to cover our needs there, which is very different.

<P><H2>what we need to store.</H2>
<UL>

  <P>Usually, when I hear people talking about using databases in Xena, they
  seem to be talking about a convenient place to store a few dozen or a few
  hundred objects. But Grendel is different in three ways:

  <UL>

    <P><LI> We already have a place to store the messages, and that's largely
    outside of our control. Messages live on IMAP or NNTP servers. Or they
    live in Berkeley mail folders. We could conceivably replace the Berkeley
    mail folders with something else, but there are sound interoperability
    reasons why we want to keep using them. Anyway, we can't replace the IMAP
    or NNTP servers. So, we're not looking for a database to store the
    messages themselves.</LI>

    <P><LI> What we need is a way to <I>index</I> the messages. That is,
    given a set of criteria, we need to find the set of messages that satisfy
    the criteria. We would expect the returned messages to be in the form of
    pointers into the actual message store; we can then chase the pointers to
    get the messages themselves. The database would contain enough
    information to build a summary line for that message.</LI>

    <P><LI> We need to be able to store hundreds of thousands of messages. (If
    you think that number is too high, then you aren't thinking about
    news.)</LI>

  </UL>

  <P>Most traditional databases that I'm familiar with let you store records
  of data. Each record consists of several fields. A few of the fields are
  special "key" fields, that you can do fast searches on.

  <P>We can use this kind of traditional database, but it turns out every
  field we store will need to be a key field, because we want to do sorting
  and searching based on any of these fields.

  <P>And we have a lot of fields to store:

  <TABLE COLS=3>
   <TR VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD>
     <UL>
      <LI>Message-id</LI>
      <LI>Folder this message is stored in</LI>
      <LI>Date</LI>
      <LI>From</LI>
     </UL>
    </TD>
    <TD>
     <UL>
      <LI>List of "To" recipients</LI>
      <LI>List of "Cc" recipients</LI>
      <LI>List of "Bcc" recipients</LI>
      <LI>Subject</LI>
      <LI>References</LI>
     </UL>
    </TD>
    <TD>
     <UL>
      <LI>Priority</LI>
      <LI>Size</LI>
      <LI>Flags (read/unread, flagged, replied, forwarded, etc.)</LI>
      <LI><I>And I'm sure I'm missing some</I></LI>
     </UL>
    </TD>
   </TR>
  </TABLE>

  <P>Actually, the set of headers to store should probably be
  user-customizable; some users (like jwz) will want to store every possible
  header.

</UL>
<P><H2>reliability needs.</H2>
<UL>

  <P>Much or all of what we'll store in the database is just cached
  information from the messages themselves. So, theoretically, if the
  database blows up, we can recreate it. Practically, though, this would suck
  a lot, as many users would have enough data that it will take hours or days
  to recreate the data.

</UL>
<P><H2>performance needs.</H2>
<UL>

  <P>It's gotta fly. Both reading and writing have to be pretty much
  instantaneous for the common cases. And the common cases are pretty broad.

  <P>We don't believe it is possible to write a database that has all the
  indexing we need, and all the reliability we need, and still get all the
  performance we need. So, we've figured out two dodges to help:

  <UL>

    <P><LI><B>Use 3.0-style summary files for the common case.</B> 

    <BR>We won't even use a spiffy database for the usual case of ``show me
    all the messages in this folder.''  Instead, we'll maintain a file for
    each folder that contains all the info we need about that folder;
    whenever the user opens up a folder, we inhale into memory the entire
    contents of the relevant file. This is a proven technique that covers the
    vast majority of common cases really well. It has some scaling problems,
    though, and it definitely doesn't allow for the nifty cross-folder views
    and searches that we really want to do. So, we still want a database to
    handle those new features.

    <P>We would love to be proven wrong, and to just throw away the summary
    file code and use the database for everything. But we are not yet
    convinced that this will ever work, and so we're not prepared to count
    on it.

    <P><LI><B>Update the database in a background thread.</B> 

    <BR>(Any database gurus will probably laugh as I clumsily describe what
    has got to be a standard database technique. If it's not a standard
    technique, I deserve a patent.) Whenever changes are made that need to be
    stored in the database, don't immediately commit them to the database,
    because this is slow and will block the user from doing anything else
    that requires the database until it completes. Instead, note them down in
    a log file, and have a background thread incrementally commit the
    changes. Any database queries would check for entries in the log file,
    and merge in results from there. This technique results in database
    changes to apparently happen instantaneously; the cost is that any
    immediate queries will run slightly slower as they merge in the
    uncommitted changes from the log file.

  </UL>

  <P>The first dodge helps us avoid the need for fast queries for the
  database, but we'll still want it as fast as possible for the new features
  that aren't handled well by summary files.

  <P>The second dodge helps us avoid the need for fast updates to the
  database, but a slow database will still definitely suck in a lot of ways,
  especially when the user does things like move thousands of messages from
  one folder to another, or receives a ton of new mail, or imports an entire
  new folder, or needs to rescan a whole folder (see below).

</UL>
<P><H2>other gotchas.</H2>
<UL>

  <P>We have to be able to quickly throw out and rebuild large chunks of
  data, because at any time we may detect that everything we once knew about
  a folder is suddenly invalid. If another application has changed an IMAP
  folder or a Berkeley mail folder, we can detect the fact that a change
  happened, but we can't know what changed. We have no choice but to throw
  out everything in the database that relates to the folder, and recreate
  it. Just the "throwing out" part can be a real expensive operation on many
  databases.

  <P>Another nasty consequence of this is that it means the database is
  probably not a good place to write down any extra information about the
  messages.  It's tempting to put annotations and extra status information
  solely in the database, without writing it in anywhere in the real message
  itself.  But because folders can be changed out from under us without
  warning, it is also tempting to consider the entire database as just a
  cache, where anything can be thrown out and recreated at will. These goals
  tend to be conflicting.

</UL>
<P><H2>fitting in with RDF.</H2>
<UL>

  <P>One bit of good news is that RDF's view of data is a model that works
  well for our needs. A really fast database that directly implements the RDF
  model can be directly used by our stuff. The main lack there would be the
  ability to sort the resulting query in any way; as near as I can tell, RDF
  does not support sorting of results. But I think we can live without the
  database sorting its results.

</UL>
<P><H2>truly ambitious stuff.</H2>
<UL>

  <P>We haven't thought a lot about it, but we'd love a database that would
  support full body text indexing on messages. Yow.

</UL>
