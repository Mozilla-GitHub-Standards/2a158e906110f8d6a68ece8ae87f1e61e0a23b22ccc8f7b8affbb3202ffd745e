<P><HR><P>

<P>Grendel is both a mail/news application, and a toolkit for building such
applications.

<P><FONT COLOR="#26AD00">Text appearing in green</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">
</FONT>indicates an issue or other shaky ground, a decision that's not
at all certain.

<P> 

<H2>Assumptions</H2>
<UL>
    These are things we are still evaluating.  But I'm looking into my
    crystal ball, guessing what the evaluation will end up being, and writing
    this document based on my guesses.  If I guessed wrong, I may have to do
    major surgery on this document.  <UL>

    <P><LI> I assume that we're going to use Sun's <A
    HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/javadocs/">javamail</A> APIs.
    I also assume we're going to be able to use very little of their actual
    implementation, unless we get to copy their code and hack it to death.
    We have ambitious performance goals, and also support of things like
    intertwingle and RDF will probably require changing most of the
    implementations.</LI>

    <P><LI> I assume that we'll end up supporting RDF.  I assume we'll have
    RDF objects corresponding to folders, messages, and the important message
    headers.  I assume we will NOT have RDF objects corresponding to MIME
    parts, although I know there are people who think this real
    important.</LI>

<H2>The diagram</H2>
<UL>

    Any document like this needs a diagram.  Here's mine.  (Click on it
    to see a larger, more readable version.)

</UL>
    <P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="the-large-diagram.gif"><IMG
        SRC="the-small-diagram.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=457></A>
<UL>

    <P>This shows the basic relationship between most of the important
    packages within grendel:

    <UL>

	<P><LI> The <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.storage.html">grendel.storage</A></TT> package implements javamail APIs
	for four different kinds of message stores: POP3, Berkeley mail
	folders, IMAP, and NNTP.

	<P><LI> Underneath the message stores, the
	<TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.storage.intertwingle.html">grendel.storage.intertwingle</A></TT> package maintains the
	intertwingle database describing what messages are in any of the
	stores.  This database is used to support RDF functionality, and to
	allow efficient searching and filtering.

	<P><LI> The <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.filters.html">grendel.filters</A></TT> package presents javamail Folder
	objects that represent the results of applying a filter on some set
	of the existing folders.  Depending on the filter, this will work
	either directly on the existing Folder objects or by querying the
	intertwingle database.

	<P><LI> The <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.view.html">grendel.view</A></TT> package takes a Folder object
	(generally obtained from either the <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.storage.html">grendel.storage</A></TT> or
	<TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.filters.html">grendel.filters</A></TT> package) and sorts or threads the messages.
	It directly supports most operations that will be needed from the
	UI.

	<P><LI> The <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.ui.html">grendel.ui</A></TT> object sits above everything, and
	implements our user interface.

	<P><LI> Third parties may write their own applications or UIs, that
	call into any of the above packages.  They may also implement their
	own javamail Folder objects, and our entire system should work with
	those objects.

    </UL>

    <P> There are many important pieces of Grendel that do
    not show up in this diagram.  This includes: 

    <UL>

	<P><LI> The <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.addressbook.html">grendel.addressbook</A></TT> package, which implements
	the user's address book and speaks to LDAP servers.

	<P><LI> The <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.composition.html">grendel.composition</A></TT> package, which presents the
	user interface for composing new messages.  This will interact with
	the <TT><A
HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.addressbook.html">grendel.addressbook</A></TT>
and <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.storage.html">grendel.storage</A></TT>packages, as well as using Alchemy to implement message editing.

	<P><LI> The <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.mime.html">grendel.mime</A></TT> package, which implements MIME
	parsers and implements Magellan content handlers for MIME messages
	and other messaging-related MIME types.

    </UL>
 
</UL>
<H1>Issues of global scope (affecting all packages)</H1>
<UL>

<I>Reusable</I> and <I>customizable</I> are key adjectives we want to keep
in mind at all times.  Unfortunately, details showing this probably
won't show up much in the rest of the document, as there are too many other
things that have to be worked out first.  But it's being kept in mind...

<H2>Scriptability</H2>

<P>Yeah, we want it.  I wish I understood better what we have to do to
get it.  I'm hoping just publish a list of classes and methods somehow?

<P> 

</UL>
<H1>Package <A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.storage.html">grendel.storage</A></H1>
<UL>

    <P>This package is where we implement most (all?) of the <A
    HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/javadocs/">javamail</A> API.
    Private to this package are any details about particular protocol
    implementations.  All the differences between NNTP, IMAP, POP, etc.  are
    packaged away in here and hidden. This also implements the RCFdata
    interfaces; that is, this is the stuff that supports RDF queries.

    <P> <HR WIDTH="100%">

    <P>One problem that comes from using the javamail API throughout is that
    it makes it difficult to innovate and optimize.  For example, javamail
    does not provide an API to get the number of undeleted messages in a
    folder.  This is a number we want to display in our UIs.  We can't just
    add a new API to our subclasses of Folder, because we want to work with
    third-party implementations of Folder as well.  And while it's possible
    to determine this number using the existing APIs, it is a very slow and
    expensive process to do so.

    <P>To solve all this, we will define a <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.storage.FolderExtra.html">FolderExtra</A> interface.
    <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.storage.FolderExtra.html">FolderExtra</A> has all the extra APIs we need, like
    getUndeletedMessageCount().  Our implementations of Folder will also
    implement the <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.storage.FolderExtra.html">FolderExtra</A> class.

    <P>When we have code (e.g., our UI code) that is given a Folder object
    and wants to call a method on <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.storage.FolderExtra.html">FolderExtra</A>, it gets a <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.storage.FolderExtra.html">FolderExtra</A> object
    by calling <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.storage.FolderExtraFactory.html">FolderExtraFactory</A>.Get().  <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.storage.FolderExtraFactory.html">FolderExtraFactory</A> determines if
    the given Folder directly implements <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.storage.FolderExtra.html">FolderExtra</A>.  If so, it returns that
    object.  If not, it creates a new object which implements all the
    <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.storage.FolderExtra.html">FolderExtra</A> methods in terms of methods available on Folder.

    <P>This all makes things a bit convoluted for callers.  But it means we
    can use our fast code for our own Folders, and be assured that things
    will work (though slower) on Folders provided by other parties.

    <P>Similarily, there is a <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.storage.MessageExtra.html">MessageExtra</A> interface and a
    <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.storage.MessageExtraFactory.html">MessageExtraFactory</A>.  Other Extra interfaces will be invented as
    necessary.

    <P>It would be nice if we could just use the <B>pk.core.Supports</B>
    interface for this kind of stuff.  However, this strategy only makes
    sense if the base Folder object implements Supports.  Since Supports is
    one of our own interfaces, and Folder comes from javasoft, I can't see
    this happening.

    <P> <HR WIDTH="100%">

    <P>The <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.storage.html">grendel.storage</A></TT> package is where the database problem lives.  Do
    we use summary files, like 3.0?  Do we use some general database?  Here
    is the current thinking: we will use something like 3.0 summary files.  A
    background thread will attempt to maintain all changes in a
    general-purpose database (see the <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.storage.intertwingle.html">grendel.storage.intertwingle</A></TT>
    package).  This database will only be used for fancy functions (cool
    searches and filters).  If the database blows up, you'll still be able to
    read your mail; if the database works well, you'll be able to do cool
    stuff too.  If we find that the database is just too expensive or too
    hard to maintain, then we'll still have a product even after we rip it
    out.

</UL>
<H1>Package <A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.mime.html">grendel.mime</A></H1>
<UL>

    <P>This is where we put in our MIME parsing code.  Maybe this is just an
    implementation of javamail APIs; maybe it is our own version, since we
    have suspicions that javamail's won't be good enough, and their APIs
    won't fit the problems we're trying to solve.

    <P>The message/rfc822 parser also goes here, maybe.  And the Magellan
    content handlers, that know how to display various messaging-related MIME
    types in a Magellan window also go here.

<P> 

</UL>
<H1>Package <A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.filters.html">grendel.filters</A></H1>
<UL>

    <P>These are classes that take Folder objects and use them to create
    other Folder objects.  The idea is to end up with a Folder object that
    acts just like any other javamail Folder object, but the messages in it
    can actually come from any number of real Folders, and are chosen via
    some constraint.

</UL>
<H1>Package <A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.view.html">grendel.view</A></H1>
<UL>

    <P>This is what gathers together the messages in a Folder, calculates a
    sorting/threading order on them, and allows for a UI to present them.

    <P>Much of the UI work is in the ``thread <NOBR>list'' --</NOBR> a scrollable list of
    messages, possibly organized in a threaded tree, which the user can
    scroll through and select and drag and manipulate.  Most of the smarts of
    the ``thread list'' are really implemented here in the <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.view.html">grendel.view</A></TT> package.

    <P><H2>Interfaces to the view package</H2>

    <P>There are three interfaces defined: the view, messages within the
    view, and observers of the view.

    <P><H3><A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.MessageSetView.html">MessageSetView</A></H3>

    This represents one view on a set of messages.

    <P><PRE>
public interface <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.MessageSetView.html">MessageSetView</A> {
  /** <I>Gets the root of the tree of
      messages that are being viewed.</I> */
  public <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.ViewedMessage.html">ViewedMessage</A> getMessageRoot();
  public void setSort(SortOrder);
  public SortOrder getSort();
  public void setIsThreaded(boolean b);
  public boolean isThreaded();

  public int getMessageCount();
  public int getUnreadMessageCount();
  public void setFlags(Message msgs[],
		       Flags flag,
		       boolean value);
  public boolean copyMessages(Message msgs[],
			      Folder folder)

  public void addObserver(<A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.MessageSetViewObserver.html">MessageSetViewObserver</A> obs);
  public void removeObserver(<A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.MessageSetViewObserver.html">MessageSetViewObserver</A> obs);
}
</PRE>

    <P>When a view is created (via the appropriate factory), the filtering
    rules that determine which messages are part of the view are
    specified. <FONT COLOR="#26AD00">To change the filtering rules, a new
    view must be created</FONT><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">.</FONT>

    <P>Once the messages are determined, however, the ordering and threading
    can be controlled.  <FONT COLOR="#26AD00">(Need to figure out exactly
    what the SortOrder class looks like.)</FONT>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The number of messages, and number of unread
    messages, can be obtained through the </FONT><TT>getMessageCount</TT> and
    <TT>getUnreadMessageCount</TT> calls.  The <TT>setFlags</TT> and
    <TT>copyMessages</TT> calls do the same things that the routines
    javamail's <A
    HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/javadocs/javax/mail/Folder.html">javax.mail.Folder</A>
    class does, but lets the user of the view ignore the fact that the
    messages in the view may in fact be from different Folder's.

    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Any time the set of messages changes,
    </FONT><FONT COLOR="#26AD00">or the order is changed</FONT><FONT
    COLOR="#000000">, registered observers will get notified.  (The set of
    messages can change when new messages appear or disappear from the
    underlying message store.)</FONT>

    <P><H3><A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.ViewedMessage.html">ViewedMessage</A></H3>

    <P>This represents one message in a view.  It is just a pointer into the
    storage representation of a Message, as well as pointers to other
    messages in the list or tree for this view.

    <P><PRE>
public interface <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.ViewedMessage.html">ViewedMessage</A> {
  /** <I>Gets the view that this
      message is a part of.</I> */
  public <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.MessageSetView.html">MessageSetView</A> getView();

  /** <I>Gets the message itself.  You
      need to go through this to find out
      stuff about the message (like its
      subject, author, etc.).</I> */
  public Message getMessage();

  /** <I>Returns the parent of this
      message.  (This is always null
      unless threading is turned on in
      the view.)</I> */
  public <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.ViewedMessage.html">ViewedMessage</A> getParent();

  /** <I>Returns the first child of this
      message.  (This is always null unless
      threading is turned on in the view.)</I> */
  public <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.ViewedMessage.html">ViewedMessage</A> getChild();

  /** <I>Returns the next message.  This
      is the next message that has the
      same parent as this message</I>.*/
  public <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.ViewedMessage.html">ViewedMessage</A> getNext();
}
</PRE>

    <P>Note that there is no random-access method of jumping around in the
    view.  <FONT COLOR="#26AD00">Do we need one?</FONT>

    <P><H3><A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.MessageSetViewObserver.html">MessageSetViewObserver</A></H3>

    <P>The <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.view.html">grendel.view</A></TT> package does not implement this class;
    rather, users of the package will provide implementations.

    <P><FONT COLOR="#26AD00">This is probably too simplistic.  We should
    probably imitate the javamail observer classes instead.</FONT>

    <P><PRE>
public interface <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.MessageSetViewObserver.html">MessageSetViewObserver</A> {
  /** <I>Some messages changed.  Each

   */
  public void messagesChanged(Enumeration inserted,
			      Enumeration deleted,
			      Enumeration changed);
};
</PRE>

    <P><H2>Factories in the view package</H2>

    <P>There will be factories to generate the different kinds of views. 
    One important view is the <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.FolderView.html">FolderView</A>, which just shows every message in
    one storage folder:

<P><PRE>
public class <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.FolderViewFactory.html">FolderViewFactory</A> {
  static public <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.view.MessageSetView.html">MessageSetView</A> Make(Folder f);
}
</PRE>

    <P>There will be another factory that take filter specifications and
    maybe a set of Folders and create a view that show messages from within
    those folders that match that filter. <FONT COLOR="#26AD00"> This needs
    to be hashed out more when filters are hashed out more.</FONT>

</UL>
<H1>Package <A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.ui.html">grendel.ui</A></H1>
<UL>

    <P>This is enormous.  Much of the work is to create the outline view
    of a set of messages, although much of that work is split off into the
    <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.view.html">grendel.view</A></TT> package.

</UL>
<H1>Package <A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.composition.html">grendel.composition</A></H1>
<UL>

    <P>This is the UI to compose messages.  It uses Alchemy as the editor;
    alchemy needs to support a plaintext mode for us, as well as full HTML
    editing.

    <P>It's tempting to think of compositions as totally isolated from the
    rest of Grendel, but some important ties exist.  Compositions get their
    headers initialized from other messages when you do a Reply or Forward.
    Quoting needs to work to suck in the text of an original message.  When
    you send a message, you often want to annotate the original message that
    it was replied-to or forwarded.  When you send a message, you want to
    append a copy of that message into the ``Sent'' folder.  You need to save
    and restore messages into a ``Drafts'' folder.  We also need to interact
    with an ``Outbox'' folder for offline compositions.

</UL>
<H1>Package <A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.addressbook.html">grendel.addressbook</A></H1>
<UL>

    <P>This talks to LDAP, and provides a nice API to all things dealing with
    addressbook.

</UL>
<H1>Package <A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.storage.intertwingle.html">grendel.storage.intertwingle</A></H1>
<UL>

    <P>There are lots of spiffy ideas in 
    <A HREF="../../blue-sky/misc/199805/intertwingle.html">intertwingle</A>

    but the one I'm focusing on here is just to keep a global database
    optimized for interesting searches across all folders.  It would be nice
    if we had a simple, unified database story that solved this and all our
    other concerns.  However, if we don't, another idea is to create a
    separate database that gets updated in the background.

</UL>
<H1>Pieces needing a package<BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>(i.e., pieces that need more thought)</FONT></H1>
<UL>

    <P>In the current picture, all of these things would get lumped into
    <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.ui.html">grendel.ui</A></TT>.  But they aren't very directly UI-oriented, and we
    would like to split them out into their own places.

<H2>Incorporation filters</H2>

<P>An incorporation filter is a filter with an associated action that changes
something about the message, or otherwise takes a concrete action. 
Actions include moving the message to a folder, or deleting it, or forwarding
it to another user.  The action only happens when the incorporation
filter finds a message that matches its criteria.  Incorporation filters
get their name because they are generally invoked on new messages that
are delivered to the user.  However, it is also useful for the user
to be able to manually invoke an incorporation filter on a selected set
of messages.

<H2>Display filters</H2>

<P>A display filter is a filter that changes some displayable attribute of
a message.  The filters described in <TT><A HREF="javadoc/Package-grendel.filters.html">grendel.filters</A></TT> are
a simple kind of display filter: they control whether a message is to be
displayed or not.  But we would also like make filters that control
other display attributes: what color to highlight this message with, or
