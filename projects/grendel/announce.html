<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>grendel overview
<BR><FONT SIZE="3">by <a href="mailto:jwz@mozilla.org">Jamie Zawinski</A>
<BR>8-Sep-1998
</FONT></H1>

<UL>

    <P>You may recall that in 1997, Netscape embarked on a project to rewrite
    Navigator/<WBR>Communicator in Java.  This project (code named ``Xena,''
    but sometimes referred to by the press as ``Javagator'') was cancelled
    before completion.

    <P>Some of us have been lobbying to give away the source to the whole
    project; this may yet happen, but navigating the legal issues involved
    has proven to be slow going.

    <P>In the mean time, we have gotten permission to release the source to
    <B>Grendel</B>, the mail/news client component of the Xena project.

</UL>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">where it was.</FONT></B>
<UL>

    <P>Grendel was pretty close to being a beta-level mail reader at the
    time the project was cancelled; we were disappointed that we didn't
    have the opportunity to finish it, but these things happen.

    <P>Just before the end, we had:

    <P><UL>

	<P><LI>A GUI with a three-pane view (of folders, message threads, and 
	message bodies.)

	<P><LI>A basic set of mail reading commands.

	<P><LI>The ability to parse and display local (Berkeley mbox) mail
	folders.

	<P><LI>The ability to fetch mail from POP3 servers.

	<P><LI>The ability to display remote IMAP folders (if memory serves,
	this was too slow to use, but it didn't need too much more work.)

	<P><LI>The ability to compose and deliver plain-text messages.

	<P><LI>A full-featured extensible MIME parser and display module,
	capable of converting MIME messages to HTML for display.

    </UL>

    <P>The most notable feature missing was the ability to display message
    bodies.  That's because Grendel, like its predecessor Communicator,
    displayed messages by converting them to HTML for presentation, and then
    handing that off to an HTML displayer.  Well, the Xena HTML displayer was
    farther from completion than Grendel was (in particular, it didn't work
    on Unix), so Grendel was only able to display messages in their raw
    state.  However, conversion of message to HTML worked: it was just that
    there was no way to display the HTML.

</UL>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">where it is.</FONT></B>
<UL>

    <P>The currently released Grendel source is not in as usable a state as
    what was described above.  There are a few reasons for this:

    <P><UL>

        <P><LI>Getting Grendel to build in the absence of the rest of the
	packages in the Xena project was a little tricky.  I removed the
	dependencies from most of the back-end libraries, but extricating
	the GUI code proved harder, so most of the GUI stuff doesn't build
	right now.

	<P><LI>Parts of Grendel were built on top of Sun's 
	<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/">JavaMail</A>
	API.  However, when we were developing Grendel, JavaMail hadn't
	been released to the public yet; we had a pre-release version.
	Well, JavaMail 1.0 and 1.1 have since been released, and they are
	slightly incompatible with the pre-release we were working with.
	That pre-release is no longer available on Sun's web site.
	So I went through and tried to port the code to work with the
	released versions of the JavaMail API.  I haven't tested it
	extensively, so chances are there are still problems.  (I'd
	be especially suspicious of the code having to do with Flags.)

	<P><LI>Since I didn't get the GUI stuff working, I don't know what
	other dependencies remain hidden beyond that.  Without the GUI,
	most features are not terribly accessible, so they would have been
	hard to test.

    </UL>

    <P>That said, there is a lot of good stuff in there, waiting for someone
    to pick it up and put it back together, especially the mailbox and MIME
    parsers, and the message-<WBR>threading algorithm.
    
    <P>Since this was my third rewrite of the MIME parser, it's structured
    a lot better than the existing 
    <A HREF="http://lxr.mozilla.org/source/lib/libmime/">
    Mozilla MIME library</A>.  It might even be worthwhile for someone to
    try and port Grendel's MIME parser from Java to C, so that it could be
    used in Mozilla.

</UL>

    probably fairly out of date at this point, but which might make
    interesting reading anyway.  (Among other things, this document was
    written before we had heard of, let alone adopted, the JavaMail API.)

</UL>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">downloading and building grendel.</FONT></B>
<UL>

    <P>Currently the Grendel sources are only available via CVS.  You can check
    out the source by doing

<PRE>
    cvs checkout mozilla/grendel
</PRE>

    <P>Please see our <A HREF="../../cvs.html">CVS page</A> for information on
    using our CVS server.

    <P>We are only distributing <TT>.java</TT> files, not <TT>.class</TT>
    or <TT>.jar</TT> files, so you'll need a working Java compiler.  There
    are gmake-style Makefiles included, but note that the dependencies are
    all wrong (since we don't know of a version of <B>makedepend</B> that
    understands Java.)  Grendel requires JDK 1.1 or newer.

    <P>You will also need to download these 3rd-party Java packages, and
    add them to your <TT>$CLASSPATH</TT> to compile or run Grendel:

    <P><UL>

        <P><LI>The <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/">
        JavaMail API</A>, version 1.1;

        <P><LI>The <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/beans/glasgow/jaf.html#download">
	JavaBeans Activation Framework</A>, version 1.0;
        
	<P><LI>The <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/#download-swing">
	Java Foundation Classes</A>, version 1.1 (Swing version 1.0.3.)

    </UL>

    <P>You will also probably need to add both the <TT>mozilla/</TT> and
    <TT>mozilla/grendel/</TT> directories to your <TT>$CLASSPATH</TT>.

    <P>Now type <TT>gmake -k</TT> and watch all the errors scroll by.
    Remember when I said that the GUI stuff didn't build?  Well, I haven't
    (yet) hacked the Makefiles to avoid trying to build the stuff that is
    unbuildable, so we need to suffer through it.

    <P>The interesting stuff that <I>does</I> build is in the
    <TT>storage</TT>, <TT>view</TT>, and <TT>mime</TT> directories.

</UL>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">running grendel.</FONT></B>
<UL>

    <P>If the GUI stuff was in a working state, you would launch it by doing:

    <P><UL><TT>java grendel.Main</TT></UL>

    <P>but it's not, so you can't.

    <P>I hacked together a rough demo that lets you point Grendel at a local
    mail folder, list the threaded contents, and select and extract a raw
    message from it.  This demo isn't much to look at, but it does pass
    through several interesting pieces of code: the folder parser, the
    parsing and maintenance of the summary files, the message threading
    algorithm, and the folder-<WBR>message-<WBR>extractor.  You can run
    this demo like so:

    <P><UL><TT>java grendel.TestFolderViewer <I>/full/path/of/mbox/file</I></TT></UL>

    <P>To demo the MIME parser, do this:

    <P><UL><TT>java grendel.mime.TestMime <I>input-file</I></TT></UL>

    <P>The <I>input-file</I> should contain a single message; an HTML
    presentation of that message will be written to stdout.


</UL>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">what now?</FONT></B>
<UL>

    <P>Nobody is currently working on Grendel.  Would you like to?
    There are several tasks one could take on:

    <UL>

      <P><LI>Port the grendel.mime class from Java to C, so that it can
      be used in Mozilla.  (It can't be used in Mozilla as-is, since Mozilla
      doesn't currently include a JVM.)

      <P><LI>Get the GUI part of Grendel working again, or write a new one,
      resulting in a working Java mail reader.

      <P><LI>Figure out how to get Grendel to display HTML (perhaps by
      borrowing from one of the other Java web browsers, or perhaps by
      writing an <A HREF="javadoc/grendel.mime.IMimeOperator.html">
      IMimeOperator</A> that converts from MIME to text/plain instead of
      to text/html.

      <P><LI>Build other Java-<WBR>based mailbox-<WBR>oriented tools on top
      of this, such as <A HREF="../../blue-sky/misc/199805/intertwingle.html">
      Intertwingle</A>.

    </UL>

    <P>There's a lot of good code in here; surely you can find something
    to do with it!
