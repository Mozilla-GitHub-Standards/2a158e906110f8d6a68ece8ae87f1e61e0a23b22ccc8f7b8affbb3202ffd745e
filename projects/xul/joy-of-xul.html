<h1>The Joy of XUL</h1>
                   
<p class="byline">by <a href="mailto:peter@bojanic.ca">Peter Bojanic</a></p>
             
            
<p>Intended audience: Application developers and development managers who 
   seek  to better understand XUL and why the Mozilla platform is built with 
   it.</p>
<hr>         
<h1>Introduction</h1>
                  
<p>XUL (pronounced "zool") is Mozilla's XML-based User interface  Language
      that lets you build feature-rich cross platform applications  that
can    run  connected or disconnected from the Internet. These applications
 are    easily  customized with alternative text, graphics and layout so
they  can   be readily  branded or localized for various markets. Web developers
already   familiar  with Dynamic HTML (DHTML) will learn XUL quickly and
can start  building applications  right away.</p>
                  
<p>This document will describe the compelling reasons for application developers 
    to leverage XUL and Mozilla technology for building cross platform applications. 
     This same investigation will provide sufficient explanation of Mozilla's 
    motivation to build XUL and why the Mozilla platform is constructed using 
    it. The key features and benefits of XUL will be explored followed by 
an   examination of supporting Mozilla technologies. Finally, a mini case 
study   of a Calendar application written in XUL will reinforce the benefits 
of building  applications with Mozilla.</p>
                  
<h1>Key Features and Benefits</h1>
                  
<table cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
         <tbody>
         <tr>
         <td valign="top">                     
      <p>Powerful widget-based markup language</p>
         </td>
         <td valign="top">                            
      <p>The goal of XUL is to build cross platform applications,     in
contrast to DHTML which is intended for developing web pages. For this reason,
     XUL is oriented toward application artifacts such as windows, labels
and     buttons instead of pages, heading levels, and hypertext links.</p>
                                          
      <p>In fact, many developers invest a significant amount effort to achieve 
     these  results in their DHTML web applications but at the cost of complexity 
and performance  and without any supporting standards.</p>
         </td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
         <td valign="top">              
      <p>Based on existing standards</p>
         </td>
         <td valign="top">              
      <p>XUL is an XML language based on W3C standard  XML 1.0.   Applications
   written in XUL are based on additional W3C standard  technologies   featuring
   HTML 4.0; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 1 and 2; Document Object   Model
 (DOM)   Levels 1 and 2; JavaScript 1.5, including ECMA-262 Edition  3 (ECMAscript);
   XML 1.0.</p>
                              
      <p>mozilla.org is going a step further by seeking W3C standardization 
 for the eXtensible Binding Language (XBL) (see "Supporting  Technologies", 
    below).</p>

      <p>Platform portability</p>
         </td>
         <td valign="top">              
      <p>Like HTML, XUL is designed to be platform-neutral,     making applications
 easily portable to all of the operating systems on which Mozilla    runs. 
 Considering the broad range of platforms that currently support Mozilla, 
    this may  be one of the most compelling features of XUL as a technology 
  for  building  applications.</p>
                          
      <p>Since XUL provides an abstraction of user interface components,
it delivers     on the promise of write-once,  run-anywhere. The user interface 
 for all   of Mozilla's core applications  (Browser, Messenger,  Address Book,
 etc.)   is written in XUL with one single  code base supporting  all Mozilla
 platforms.</p>

         </tr>
         <tr>
         <td valign="top">              
      <p>Separation of presentation from application logic</p>
         </td>
         <td valign="top">              
      <p>One of the major downfalls of most web applications     is the tight
 coupling of user interface elements with client application     logic. This
 poses a significant problem in team environments because the skills required 
to  develop   these two parts are often satisfied by different people.</p>
               
      <p>       XUL provides a clear separation among the client application
 definition     and programmatic logic ("content" consisting of XUL, XBL,
and JavaScript),      presentation ("skin" consisting of CSS and images),
and language-specific       text labels ("locale" consisting of DTDs and
string bundles in .properties files). The layout and appearance  of   XUL
 applications can be altered independently of the application definition
    and  logic. Further, the application can be localized for different languages
     and regions independently of its logic or presentation.</p>
                        
      <p>This degree of separation results in applications that are easier
 to   maintain    by programmers and readily customized by designers and
  language  translators.   The work flow of these interdependent activities
   is more easily  coordinated   than with HTML-based web applications, with
   less impact on the overall  stability   and quality of the system.</p>

      <p>Easy customization, localization, or branding</p>
         </td>
         <td valign="top">       
      <p>Another highly practical benefit of the separation     that XUL provides
among application logic, presentation, and language text     is the ease
of customizing for different customers or groups of users.</p>
                        
      <p>A developer can maintain one primary code base for their application 
  and    customize the logo and branding for each of their customers by supplying 
      different skins. An application that is written and deployed with an 
English     language user interface can be translated to French for the same 
customer.     While such changes are extensive and affect most (if not all) 
of the application,     they are also isolated from one another enabling the
core XUL definition    and  application logic to be shared among all of the
custom versions. </p>

<h1> Supporting Technologies</h1>
                  
<p> There are number of other technologies introduced by Mozilla that complement 
      XUL for building cross platform web applications.  </p>
                  
<table cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">

      <p>XBL</p>
         </td>
         <td valign="top">        
      <p>The eXtensible Bindings Language (XBL) is a markup     language that
defines special new elements, or "bindings" for XUL widgets.      With XBL,
developers can define new content for XUL widgets, add additional      event
handlers to a XUL widget, and add new interface properties and methods.  
    Essentially, XBL empowers developers with the ability to extend XUL by 
  customizing   existing tags and creating new tags of their own.</p>
                        
      <p>By using XBL, developers can easily build custom user interface widgets
    such as progress meters, fancy pop-up menus, and even toolbars and search
     forms. These custom components can then be used in XUL applications by
  specifying    the custom tag and associated attributes.</p>

      <p> Overlays</p>
         </td>
         <td valign="top">        
      <p>Overlays are XUL files used to describe extra content     for the 
UI. They are a general mechanism for  adding UI for additional  components, 
    overriding small pieces of a XUL file without having to resupply  the 
whole    UI, and reusing particular pieces of the UI.</p>
                        
      <p>Overlays are a powerful mechanism for customizing and extending existing
      applications because they work in two related but highly different ways.
     In one respect, Overlays are synonymous with "include" files in other
  languages because an application may specify that an Overlay be included 
 in its definition. But Overlays can also be specified externally, enabling 
 the designer to <em>  superimpose</em> them upon an application without changing
   the original source.</p>
                       
      <p> In practical terms, this enables developers to maintain one code 
stream     for a given application then apply custom branding or include special
features     for customers with a completely independent code base. This
leads to an   overall  solution that is easier and less costly to maintain 
in the long  run.</p>
                        
      <p>There is an additional benefit to Overlays for software developers 
 who   intend  to add features to Mozilla that they wish to keep proprietary. 
 The   Netscape  Public License (NPL) and Mozilla Public License (MPL) require 
 developers   who alter original work (source code files that are provided 
 with Mozilla)   to release the source code for these changes to their customers. 
 Overlays   can be used to add features to Mozilla without contaminating the
 original   open source code with proprietary alterations.</p>

         <td valign="top">       
      <p>XPCOM and XPConnect are complementary technologies   that  enable 
the integration of external libraries with XUL applications.</p>
                        
      <p>XPCOM, which stands for Cross Platform Component Object Model, is
 a  framework    for writing cross-platform, modular software. XPCOM components
  can be written    in C, C++, and JavaScript, and they can be used from
C,   C++, JavaScript,   Python, and with Perl extensions under development.</p>
                        
      <p>XPConnect is a technology which enables simple interoperation between
    XPCOM  and  JavaScript.  XPConnect allows JavaScript objects to transparently 
    access and manipulate XPCOM objects. It also enables JavaScript objects 
  to  present XPCOM compliant interfaces to be called by XPCOM objects.</p>
                        
      <p>Together, XPCOM and XPConnect enable developers to create XUL applications 
     that require the raw processing power of compiled languages (C/C++) or
  access   to the underlying operating system.</p>

<h1>Case Study: A Mozilla Calendar Application</h1>
                  
<p> This mini case study describes how OEone Corporation (<a href="http://www.oeone.com/">
        http://www.oeone.com</a>) integrated its Calendar application with
 the   core  Mozilla product. The Calendar application is comprised of a
XUL  front   end  and an XPCOM component that leverages libical, a native
library written in C, for  date  operations and calendar data storage. The
Calendar was initially developed   exclusively for Linux but was successfully
 ported to both Macintosh and  Windows within a week.</p>
                  
<p><em>XUL provides a rich set of UI components.</em> The user interface
for  the Calendar is written entirely in XUL,  JavaScript,  and CSS, which
is a  testament to the power and flexibility of this application building
framework.  It uses simple XUL components like boxes, grids, and stacks to
compose  views for the weeks,  days, and months. The initial implementation
of Calendar  did not exploit XBL because the developers involved were not
experienced with this complementary technology. But future plans for the
Calendar include converting many of these UI components to XBL widgets to
further simplify their implementation. </p>
                  
<p><em>XPCOM/XPConnect enables integration of native code.</em> A fully-featured 
     open source calendar library, libical  (<a href="http://www.softwarestudio.org/libical/">
        http://www.softwarestudio.org/libical/</a>),  was harvested for the 
 Calendar   project. Libical is an Open Source implementation  of the IETF's 
 	    iCalendar   Calendaring and Scheduling protocols. (RFC 2445,  	    2446,
 and 2447). It  parses iCal components and provides a   C API  for manipulating
 the component   properties, 	    parameters, and subcomponents.  The library
 was initially   integrated by writing an XPCOM wrapper to adapt  its interface.
 To improve   performance a greater proportion of application  logic was
  migrated   from JavaScript to the XPCOM component.</p>
                  
<p><em>Separation of presentation from logic makes applications resilient 
    to change.</em> The original UI implementation made extensive use of graphics
     for rendering the month and week views. Later, as the developers learned
    more about XUL and the implementation of the basic components matured,
better ways    were identified to simplify the composition of the UI. This
lead to  increased screen drawing   performance and reduced memory and disk
footprint requirements of the application.    The UI for the month and week
views was practically rewritten while the  application logic remained virtually
unchanged.  </p>
    
<p><em>Porting XUL applications to other platforms is trivial.</em> The 
 Calendar    originated as a Linux application with no consideration given 
  to porting  it to other platforms. But later, when the original developer 
  (OEone Corporation)  contributed the source to the Mozilla project, the 
Calendar  had to be migrated  to the Windows and Macintosh platforms. The 
UI for the  XUL application required  zero porting effort because it worked 
with almost  no alteration on both new  platforms. Similarly, since the UI 
code is written  in JavaScript, the interaction  logic worked with no effort. 
However, since  the libical library is written  in C, more significant effort 
was required  to migrate this component to the  other platforms.</p>
                 
<p> Fortunately an implementation of the libical library was already available
    for Macintosh  so, with the cross platform nature of XPCOM, a Macintosh
  calendar  implementation was working  within a few days. However there
was   no existing  Win32 port available, so developers had to undertake a
porting   effort to migrate libical to Windows.  Within a week this too was
complete   and Mozilla had a working calendar for  all three primary platforms:
Linux,   Macintosh, and Windows.</p>
                 
<p><em>XPInstall is easy for developers and for users.</em> The Calendar is
not  a planned   deliverable  for the Mozilla 1.0 release, and therefore
  is not included   as a standard component  in regular nightly and milestone
  release builds.   Developers who are equipped  with the software and knowledge
  required to  compile Mozilla can set an optional  environment variable
and   build the Calendar  themselves. But many Mozilla users who want to
try out   the Calendar can't  afford this luxury. Using XPInstall  it was
easy for  the developers to package  a version of Calendar that could  be
installed  directly over the Internet  by clicking a link.</p>
                  
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
                  
<p>Mozilla, featuring XUL, delivers a compelling technology for developing 
    cross platform applications with the same rich user interface and end 
user experience     as native desktop applications. Designers who are experienced 
in building    web applications using W3C standard technologies can leverage 
this experience     from the browser directly to the desktop.</p>
                  
<p>Before the web became the standard for delivering applications to users 
    across disparate desktops, this problem was solved with cross platform 
 client-server   tools. But these offerings were invariably proprietary, cost
 a substantial   amount of money per developer, and had runtime license fees
 that kept you   humble and tightly tethered to the vendor. Mozilla delivers
 much of the same  value as these cross platform tools, but with an open
source  license.</p>
                  
<p>As a rapidly maturing cross platform technology, XUL could fill an interesting 
 void   for technologies such as Java J2EE and Microsoft .Net which focus 
on enabling   network access to distributed objects. Dynamic application logic
can benefit   significantly from a UI presentation layer that is standards-based, 
 scriptable,   extensible, and similarly distributable over the Internet.</p>
                  
<p>XUL blurs the distinction between desktop application and Internet browser 
    apps because it is firmly entrenched in both worlds. Some web applications 
    will benefit from being migrated to XUL because of the enhanced UI capabilities, 
    consistent implementation of the specification across supported platforms, 
    and access to native resources such as shared libraries and the local 
file    system.</p>
                  
<p>Whether you need to migrate an existing web application to the desktop, 
    are looking for a technology that will enable you to easily port your 
applications    to multiple platforms, or want to integrate your own cool 
features into  the  browser, XUL warrants serious consideration.<br>
