Seamonkey Localization and Leveraging Tools</h1></center>

 and feedbacks.

Localizability issues</a>; start to work on the full spec of L10n Tools.</li>

<li>
03/18/99: Finishing up the first draft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
The quality of localization of a software product relies on collective 
 efforts from various sources including good internationalization planning and
 support, localizability consideration in the software design and 
 implementation phases, and a set of state-of-the-art localization tools. 
 A set of good localization tools not only increases the quality of the 
 localization but also reduces the related cost. The localization and 
 leveraging tools we created for earlier generations of Communicator clients
 set good example of this concept.

<p>Seamonkey is our next generation browsing and messaging client whose
 internal architecture is undergoing drastic restructuring. Most of the
 components, including user interface, will be rewritten using new 
 technologies such as AOM, XUL, and XPCOM style modularization.
 Subsequently, the tools for earlier client release become practically 
 insufficient and potentially inefficient. To solve this problem, we need to 
 review our existing tools and revamp them to fulfill the requirements of the
 new generation client products.

<p>In this document, the author will analyze the requirements of the new
 tools and examine our existing tools for their capacity. Then come up with a
 outline of how to develop localization and leveraging tools
 for our next generation client product, Seamonkey.

<p>Finally, as many other documents, this document is to be updated as we 
 collect more information and the client modules evolve.

<h2>
<a NAME="principles"></a>Design Principles</h2>
Before jumping to the design and implementation of the tools, it is a good
 idea to list the principles we intend to follow along the design and 
 implementation process:
<ul>
<li>
<u>Portability</u>. Seamonkey is designed toward the direction of 
 <b><i>platform independence.</i></b> There is no reason to develop platform
 dependent tools for a platform independent product.</li>

<li>
<u>Consistency</u>. It would be a localization nightmare if we need a 
 different set of tools for each individual component of the client product.
 Needing different sets of tools for different components of the client  
 indicates our client localizability solutions are not consistent nor 
 developers friendly. For localizers, multiple file formats reduces their
 productivity, too. Therefore, we shall advocate a singular localizability
 solution across all client modules and components wherever feasible.</li>

<li>
<u>Validability</u>. Normally, localization work is performed at a remote
site. The translators need to be able to validate the results in their local
environment. Sending translations back and forth between we and localizers
is time consuming and inclined to misplace or lose data.</li>

<li>
<u>Leveragibility</u>. Localization is costly. The ability to leverage is
essential to bring down the cost. In addition, it will make the translation
consistency among releases.</li>

<li>
<u>Flat file</u>.&nbsp; Ideally, we want to developers to put localizable
resources in flat file; if not feasible, we shall convert them to flat
files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="strategies"></a>Strategies</h2>
With the principles in mind, here are our design and implementation strategies:
<ul>
<li>
<u>Centralized</u>. We shall eliminate the number of different file formats
need to process and localize. In client development, we want to adopt the
same localizability solution whenever applicable. For client localization
, we want to reduce the variety of file format the translators need to
deal with. Therefore, we need to adopt a singular file format as the center
of localization. Other file formats need to be converted to this format
before sending to localization vendors.</li>

<li>
<u>Incremental</u>. In consideration of time constraint, we want to develop
 the tools incrementally: begin with basic features, then gradually migrate
 to the full blown version. This strategy also fits the nature of software
 development cycle: incremental evolution and iterative refinement.</li>

<li>
<u>Componentized</u>. A good software system shall be be highly 
 componentized. The concept of Data abstraction and information hiding 
 shall be applied to identify our problem domain and system functionality.
 Properties and behaviors of each component will be analyzed and identified 
 so that they are highly cohered. Relationships and interfaces between 
 components will be clearly defined so that there are loosely coupled.</li>

<li>
<u>Pluggable</u>. If our system is highly componentized, individual modules
 shall be pluggable. This will give us a great advantage of leveraging 
 existing tool components while keeping the flexibility of adapting to new 
 technology.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="l10nTypes"></a>Localization work in Seamonkey</h2>
In Mozilla 5.0,&nbsp; L10n work can be divided into three categories:
<blockquote>
<li>
<a NAME="xulUI"></a><i>XUL-based User Interfaces</i>. The adopted localizability
solution for XUL based UI is the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-l10n.html#pro1">language-specific
DTD approach</a>. All localizable resources needed in XUL will be declared
as general entities in the external DTD and substituted by the XUL parser
before the XUL is converted into DOM tree. Resource strings in this type
of DTD files need to be extracted into intermediate file format, say L10n
file,&nbsp; that the localization vendors can easily deal with.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="strRes"></a><i>Base component modules </i>and <i>non-XUL describable
UI such as native widget</i>s. The "nsIStringBundle" is our 5.0 equivalent
of XP_GetString(). It provides a COMified&nbsp; interface to retrieve resource
strings from Java-property-like files. Resource strings in such files need
to extracted into the so called L10n file for the vendors as well.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="xpStr"></a><i>Legacy code</i>. Seamonkey contains some 4.x modules
which use XP_GetString() to get resource strings from resource files. To
localize the legacy code, we can either create a set of C wrappers around
nsStringBundle() or use the 4.x XP_GetString() approach directly. The former
is preferred.</li>
</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="toolspec"></a>Plan</h2>
Based on what we have established so far, the author would like to layout
the plan, by priority, for localization and leveraging tools as below.
<ol>
<li>
Define the intermediate file format, say L10n, as the center of the 
 localization and leveraging work.</li>

<li>
Write tools to convert files between the L10n format and all existing file
formats such as the property file and DTD file in Seamonkey or the DOG
file in legacy code. These tools shall be highly modularized and pluggable
so that they can be built into either command line tools or graphical user
interface based tools.</li>

<li>
Write tools to collect resource strings from all L10n files, organize them
into a sortable data structure. The purpose of this is to compare translations
between modules or UI components so that we can leverage them among different
components,&nbsp; different releases and even different products. The ability
of collecting and comparing also allows us to increase the consistency
and quality of translations.</li>

<li>
Build graphic user interface based tools on top of the command line tools.
Since modularization and pluggability has been the design and implementation
strategies, we shall be able to reuse developed functions in the command
line tools and&nbsp; construct user interface on top of them.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
Tasks breakdown and estimated resources allocation</h2>
The plan laid out above will be executed in an incremental fashion, phase
by phase, as listed below.
<ul>
<li>
Prerequisite. Define a flat file format which will be used to store 
 translation. So far, there are two file formats, the Java property file 
 format and the 4.x DOG file format, under discussion. The final decision 
 is pending on the inputs from our localization vendors and OEM customers.

<p><b>Java property file</b>
<p><u>Pros</u>
<ul>
<li>Industry standard. The Java property file format is the center file
 format of localization for Java applications. It's more likely that 
 localization vendors are more comfortable with this file format.</li>
<li>It's the file format being used by the nsStringBundle interface in 
 Seamonkey. Another standalone module also uses a similar file format.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Cons</u>
<ul>
<li>Some feedbacks suggest that translators might accidentally damage the
 keys in the property file.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>DOG file</b>
<p><u>Pros</u>
<ul>
<li>It's the central file format for 4.x localization. All 4.x localization 
 and leveraging tools work with DOG files. We can save lots of implementation
 efforts by adopting DOG format.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Cons</u>
<ul>
<li>It's a proprietary file format; we might be the only company uses this
  format.</li>
<li>The property file used by nsStringBundle and other modules needs to be 
 converted into DOG format. Although, this shall not be a significant effort.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>
 </li>

<li>
<a NAME="phase1"></a>Phase 1 (entry level). Command line localization
tools needed for each of the first two categories:</li>

<ol>
<li>
DTD files (for XUL)</li>

<ul>
<li>
DTD files-> L10n files. A DTD parser to extract entity names and values
pairs into L10n files which will be sent to vendors to localization. Entity
values containing markup or URLs can be dealt separately.</li>

<li>
L10n files-> DTD files. A flat file parser to extract result strings and
replace English strings in DTD with localized ones.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Property files (for nsStringBundle)</li>

<ul>
<li>
Property file-> L10n files.</li>

<li>
L10n files ->&nbsp; property files.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Legacy code. Create a set of C wrappers around nsStringBundle() or use
the 4.x XP_GetString() approach. The former is preferred.</li>
</ol>

<li>
Phase 2 (intermediate level).</li>

<ul>
<li>
A localization tool (and a potential leveraging tool) to</li>

<ul>
<li>
Collect all localization results from the L10n files generated from <a href="#phase1">phase 1</a>.</li>

<li>
Sort localization results by different attributes such as</li>

<ul>
<li>
by English text</li>

<li>
by UI components (menu item...)</li>

<li>
by application component (navigator window, mail/news windows)</li>
</ul>

<li>
Dump collected translations by sorted attributed (mostly ID) to a single
L10n file.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Leveraging tool</li>

<ul>
<li>
Match/find a localized resource by a given "English string".</li>

<li>
Automated batch job to leverage existing translations.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
Phase 3 (advanced level)</li>

<ul>
<li>
GUI based cross platform tool (might be a browser-based) to give WYSWYG
affect. The translators can verify the result as they progress.</li>

<li>
The translators can leverage/import existing results from other components.</li>

<li>
Leveraging 4.x results.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Dump 4.x result to L01n files for 5.0 use.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
