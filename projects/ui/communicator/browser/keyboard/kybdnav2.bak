<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>This spec will address the keyboard navigation as it relates to the Seamonkey browser navigation through web
	pages. Visual indication of <A HREF="#Visual%20Indication%20Of%20Focus%7C">focus</A> is depicted below. Issues
	of selection not referring to the controls will be addressed in another document. All toolbar commands are accessible
	through the menu bar and do not need extra navigation through the mail UI. See the relevant UI spec for the menu.
	Page author supplied Accesskeys (supported in HTML 4.X) are an alternate method to provide focus and activation
	of items with in a page. These one keystroke access methods are useful for those who experience difficulty in two
	key and mouse operation as well as those who want a quick method of using a page.</P>
	<P><BR>
	The <B>Tab</B> key will cycle through controls and items taking the order presented in the source, generally from
	top to bottom left to right unless source defines the tab order otherwise. ( HTML 4.0 functionality allows assigning
	of tab order. All unassigned items will be presented after the assigned items and default to the previously mentioned
	behavior.) To reverse this order use <B>Shift+Tab</B>. Once the cycling finishes with those defined in one area
	the tab order will take it to the next area/frame. <B>Enter</B> or <B>Return</B> keys also activate the &quot;submit&quot;
	button. The <B>Space Bar</B> will activate the item with focus and when there is no &quot;submit&quot; button <B>Enter</B>
	or <B>Return</B> keys will also activate the item.

	With the development of technology the capabilities of Seamonkey have expanded. However, the keyboard access to these
	new functions within a web page are as yet undefined in Seamonkey. This document is meant to confirm current 4.X keyboard
	navigation that works for use in Seamonkey. In addition, this document will identify and provide solutions for those
	areas where 4.X is inadequate.
	<P>Keyboard navigation for 4.X is inadequate. The problems are:
	<UL>
		<LI>Inconsistent and incomplete keyboard navigation for moving through different panes in Browser, Mail, and News
		<LI>Inconsistent and incomplete keyboard navigation in forms and frames
	</UL>
	<H3><A NAME="Design%20Goals"></A>Design Goals and Philosophy</H3>
	In redesigning the keyboard navigation for Seamonkey we wanted to keep those parts that work best and those that
	would be difficult for people to adapt away from and to make it easy and logical to access the new functionality
	that the technology affords.
	<H3><A NAME="Tasks"></A>Tasks</H3>
	<UL>
		<LI>Define how to select a URL and jump to that URL.
		<LI>Define keystrokes that take you from pane to pane within Browser, Mail, and News windows.
		<LI>Define how to navigate through items/active elements of a page.
		<LI>Define how to use the controls.

	For simplicity, we call the web browser areas:

	<P>Users should also be able to use the keypad to navigate - it prevents them from having to reach all over the
	keyboard and from having to press two keys at once, both of which can be difficult for some users. In this design,
	there is no alternative offered for the home/end keys, the page up/down keys, and the ctrl-arrow combinations.
	There is, however, room to add component-specific shortcuts to common functions if we decide to add them later.
	This design has drawbacks for those with limited motion control. Though it decreases the number of keystrokes it,
	the keys are so close together there may be a problem with accidentally hitting the wrong key. <B>Alternate solutions
	would be: allowing people to designate their own single key short cuts (accesskeys) or assigning an on/off for
	special mapping for one finger web page navigation on the main keyboard. The later alternate solution would work
	for lap top users as well who do not have a numberic key pad. </B>Stickykeys were considered but they have the
	draw back of adding keystrokes for those with the least ability to perform a keystroke.

		<LI>Allow the user to use the find command to jump to a link instead of tabbing there. It would save a lot of keystrokes,
		especially if one programs the keystrokes as macros. But this requires that focus moves to the location that find
		highlights.
		<LI>Allow the user to use find command to jump to text in buttons. (Will not implement)
		<LI>Allow the user to use find command to jump to image by searching on its alternative content (e.g., &quot;alt&quot;
		attribute). (Under discussion)
		<LI>Behavior - When the focus moves to a control that is off the screen the screen view should shift so that the
		user can see the item.
		<LI>Allow the user to turn on and off Access Keys supplied by the page. (Though we will support Access Keys we
		are not able to do this at this time)
