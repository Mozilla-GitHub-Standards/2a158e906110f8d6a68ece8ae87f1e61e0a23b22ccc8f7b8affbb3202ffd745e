<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>offer a design that is not overwhelming yet offers access to controlling 
    the behavior</li>
  <li>make it simple to get the best default</li>
  <li>distinguish between the specification of how to handle the given instance 
    of the content type they are currently downloading and the default handling 
    of that file type 
    <ul>
      <li>In this design the preference based &quot;Edit File Type&quot; is always 
        being used to edit the default, whereas temprary handling of a file is 
        handled within this first dialog.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<div class="updatehilite"> 
  <h2><span style="color: red;">Update</span></h2>
<p>based on usability feedback and testing the design below 
  we are considering going back to a simplified design similat to the 4.x design 
  as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="design3.png" width="441" height="320"></p>
<p>this design would be used in place of images 1 and 4 shown 
  below.</p>

<h2>When downloading a file</h2>
<h3>Case A: File type has been encountered before or has a know OS file type association</h3>
<p>Once a filetype is has an entry in the helper apps preferences or it has an 
  association that can be retrieved from the operating system and a file of the 
  same type is downloaded, the dialog enables two main choices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use default action...: Using the default action that has been previously 
    set up. This section will show the user in a text field what action has been 
    set up as a default. The user can change that default setting again at any 
    time a file is downloaded by using the &quot;Change Default...&quot; button 
    or by going to the &quot;Helper Applications&quot; preferences to open the 
    &quot;Edit File Type&quot; dialog. A checkbox can be unchecked to not show 
    this dialog anymore when enocuntering this type of file and just appy the 
    default action 
    <ul>
      <li>Pressing OK in this situation will dismiss the dialog and apply the 
        default action. This is the case even if Netscape does not have an entry 
        in its database, since it falls back to letting the OS handle the file 
        using the OS's default association.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use a different action for this file: The user may choose a different action 
    for the file that is currently being downloaded. Using option allows the user 
    to treat a specific file differently for one time without permanently changing 
    the defaults. For example a user chooses to open a specific .doc file using 
    &quot;Notepad.exe&quot; because he or she knows its not really of type &quot;application/ms-word&quot;. 
    The sub-options are to either save the file or to open it with a specific 
    application. The application name field in &quot;Open with application&quot; 
    displays the Application's file name and should be made editable for Linux 
    and Win32 to let users type in a path to the application.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="design2.2.png" width="441" height="360"></p>
<p>Clicking on Set Default... will open a new dialog that lets the user set the 
  defaults for that MIME type:</p>
<p><img src="prefs2.2_save.png" width="441" height="360"></p>
<p>The top area of this dialog lets the user adjust the description, the extensions 
  associated with that MIMR type (TBD: Mac users may want to set type and creator 
  codes here). The checkbox &quot;Always use this MIME type when sending Mail 
  attachments&quot; lets users map this MIME-types to files of this type that 
  get attached to Mail messages.(Note: this prefs really belongs into a general 
  section, not under Navigator)</p>
<p>The bottom area of this dialog lets the user set the default action. 4 possibilities 
  are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Handled by Netscape&quot;: Lets Netscape open this file as an internal 
    document. This is only enabled for file types that Netscape is prepared to 
    handle inline, such as JPG, GIF, PNG, HTML, TXT etc.</li>
  <li>&quot;Opened&quot; (see screenshot below): lets the user set this so the 
    downloaded document will be directly opened with an application</li>
  <li>&quot;Saved to disk&quot;: this would be default</li>
  <li>&quot;Used with a plugin&quot;: This option lets the user choose a plugin 
    to open this file. This is enabled when there are plugins available on the 
    user's Netscape installation that can handle this file type.</li>
</ul>
<p>This screenshot below shows what this dialog looks like when the user chooses 
  the option &quot;Open this file&quot;. Two choices are displayed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Using default application&quot;: Lets the Operating System handle 
    opening of the file. If the OS has this file type registered, then the application 
    assigned to by the OS will be passed this file to open. If not the user see 
    the usual OS based dialogs to pick an application</li>
  <li>Using...: Lets the user pick a default application to open this type of 
    file in when downloaded in Netscape. Note: this is a local setting that does 
    not override the system settings. The application name field displays the 
    Application's file name and should be made editable for Linux and Win32 to 
    let users type in a path to the application.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="prefs2.2_open.png" width="441" height="360"></p>
<p>Completing this setup will get the user back to the dialog from before except 
  that that dialog has been changed to reflect the default settings that the user 
  just edited. (see below in next section)</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>File type is encountered for the first time and has no default OS application 
  associated with it</h3>
<p>When a filetype is encountered for the first time and has no OS file type association, 
  the user will see a dialog that lets him or he set up what to do this file in 
  the future. That directs him towards the &quot;Edit file type&quot; window from 
  the Helper Applications preferences.</p>
<p>OK button is disabled until either a default is set or &quot;Use a different 
  action for this file&quot; is chosen.</p>
<p>Note: the dialog is similar in design to that design above being used when 
  a file type either has an OS default association or the file type has been saved 
  in Netscape's file database. so the user recognizes it and can leverage his 
  or her knowledge on how the dialog works.</p>
<p><img src="design2.2_firsttime.png" width="441" height="360"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>When creating a new file type in preferences</h3>
<h4>Goals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>leverage same design layout/wording as above so users can see and understand 
    the connection</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="prefs_newtype_2.2.png" width="569" height="466"></p>
<h3>Special cases:</h3>
<p>In certain cases the vendor of a helper app may desire to not have the user 
  go through having to see the first dialog at all. This is the case e.g with 
  streaming video applications such as from RealVideo. In those cases the system 
  setting depicted below is usually set to not &quot;confirm open after download&quot; 
  in Win32. We should &quot;listen to&quot; this setting and bypass the first 
  dialog altogether. does MacOS does have a similar system setting in its Internet 
  control panel that we should also listen to (&quot;Processing with Application&quot;).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Possible assumptions that can be made to simplify choices:</p>
<p>- Never write-modify an OS setting, setting is only used in Netscape<br>
  - The Netscape file types database does not replicate the OS file associations, 
  it only records when files are set up differently for use with Netscape.<br>
  - if this implimented in stages, the dialog could be initially released without 
  plugin integration<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TBD:</p>
<p>On MacOS this dialog could be extended to give access to the OS's &quot;File 
  Exchange&quot; control panel which allows users to map downloaded file to Mac 
  files using proper creator type and document type.</p>
