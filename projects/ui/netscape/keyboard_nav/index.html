<blockquote><p>This spec will address the keyboard navigation as it relates 

    to the Seamonkey browser navigation through web pages, the keyboard navigation 

    of sidebar and Mail. Visual indication of <a href="#Visual%20Indication%20Of%20Focus%7C">focus</a> 

    is depicted below. Issues of selection not referring to the controls will 

    be addressed in another document. All toolbar commands are accessible through 

    the menu bar and do not need extra navigation through the mail UI. See the 

    relevant UI spec for the menu. Page author supplied Accesskeys (supported 

    in HTML 4.X) are an alternate method to provide focus and activation of 

    items with in a page. These one keystroke access methods are useful for 

    those who experience difficulty in two key and mouse operation as well as 

    those who want a quick method of using a page. <br> &nbsp;</p>

    <p>In the browser the <b>Tab</b> key will cycle through controls and items 

    taking the order presented in the source, generally from top to bottom left 

    to right unless source defines the tab order otherwise. (HTML 4.0 functionality 

    allows assigning of tab order. All unassigned items will be presented after 

    the assigned items and default to the previously mentioned behavior.) To 

    reverse this order use <b>Shift+Tab</b>. Once the cycling finishes with 

    those defined in one area the tab order will take it to the next area/frame. 

    <b>Enter</b> or <b>Return</b> keys also activate the &quot;submit&quot; 

    button. The <b>Space Bar</b> will activate the item with focus and when 

    there is no &quot;submit&quot; button <b>Enter</b> or <b>Return</b> keys 

    will also activate the item.</p>

    <p><a name="Email%20summary">In Email the </a><a name="Email%20summary"><b>Tab</b></a><a

     name="Email%20summary"> will cycle through Folders pane, Subject pane, 

    Message pane beginning with items in the Envelop area of the messages pane, 

    any operable items in the rest of the message area, to the sidebar and the 

    items in the open panel of the sidebar. The UP and Down Arrow keys will 

    be used to highlight folders and subjects and </a><a name="Email%20summary"><b>Space</b></a><a

    <h3><a name="Current%20State%20of%20Affairs">Current state of affairs</a></h3>

    <p>With the development of technology the capabilities of Seamonkey have 

    expanded. However, the keyboard access to these new functions within a web 

    page are as yet undefined in Seamonkey. This document is meant to confirm 

    current 4.X keyboard navigation that works for use in Seamonkey. In addition, 

    this document will identify and provide solutions for those areas where 

    4.X is inadequate. </p>

    <p>Keyboard navigation for 4.X is inadequate. The problems are: 

    <ul type="disc">

        <li>Inconsistent and incomplete keyboard navigation for moving through 

        different panes in Browser, Mail, and News 

        <li>Inconsistent and incomplete keyboard navigation in forms and frames 

        

    </ul>

    <h3><a name="Design%20Goals">Design Goals and Philosophy</a></h3>

    <p>In redesigning the keyboard navigation for Seamonkey we wanted to keep 

    those parts that work best and those that would be difficult for people 

    to adapt away from and to make it easy and logical to access the new functionality 

    that the technology affords. The keyboard navigation should be discoverable 

    and everything not provided for with accelerators or Accesskeys needs to 

    be represented so that no functionality is mouse dependent. </p>

    <h3><a name="Tasks">Tasks</a></h3>

    <ul type="disc">

        <li>Define how to select a URL and jump to that URL. 

        <li>Define keystrokes that take you from pane to pane within Browser, 

        Mail, and News windows. 

        <li>Define how to navigate through items/active elements of a page.

            the engineers and community.</p>

            <p>For instance when the user is looking at a web page and wants 

            to key back to the top or bottom of a page their first inclination 

            is to use Home and End. As implemented in Win 4.X these do not work 

            so the user may assume that it is broken or the application does 

            not have a go to top or go to bottom. Seldom do users after being 

            unsuccessful with the obvious try something more complicated when 

            trying to do something so simple.</p>

            <p>Mac behavior is modal depending on the type of field has focus 

            or if no field has focus. And it does not give as full access to 

            the keyboard user.</td>

            view are moved to the top. This would work similarly for End.</p>

            <p>Ctrl+Home works only in Fields and takes the user to the beginning

previous or next panel. Use Space bar to select/open a panel that is closed, 

Tab into the content, use web page navigation techniques here. To get to another 

panel, from inside an active open panel Tab or Shift+Tab to beginning of panel

    page up/down keys, and the ctrl-arrow combinations. There is, however, room 

    to add component-specific shortcuts to common functions if we decide to 

    add them later. This design has drawbacks for those with limited motion 

    control. Though it decreases the number of keystrokes it, the keys are so 

    close together there may be a problem with accidentally hitting the wrong 

    key. <b>Alternate solutions would be: allowing people to designate their 

    own single key short cuts (accesskeys) or assigning an on/off for special 

    mapping for one finger web page navigation on the main keyboard. The later 

    alternate solution would work for lap top users as well who do not have 

    a numeric key pad. </b>Stickykeys were considered but they have the draw 

    back of adding keystrokes for those with the least ability to perform a 

    keystroke. </p>

  <p>Selecting a text in the URL/Search field does not necessarily take you to 
    that URL. The behavior of the URL/Search field when Enter or Return are used 
    is defined in the Smart Browsing &amp; Search UI Spec.</p>
  <p>All toolbar commands are accessible through the menu bar and do not need 
    extra keyboard navigation through the main UI.</p>
  <p>Focus to the pane is indicated as mentioned above selection however is outlined 
    in another spec. </p>
  <h3><a name="Suggestions">Suggestions:</a></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Allow the user to use the find command to jump to a link instead of tabbing 
      there. It would save a lot of keystrokes, especially if one programs the 
      keystrokes as macros. But this requires that focus moves to the location 
      that find highlights. 
    <li>Allow the user to use find command to jump to text in buttons. (Will not 
      implement) 
    <li>Allow the user to use find command to jump to image by searching on its 
      alternative content (e.g., &quot;alt&quot; attribute). (Under discussion) 
    <li>Behavior - When the focus moves to a control that is off the screen the 
      screen view should shift so that the user can see the item. 
    <li>Allow the user to turn on and off Access Keys supplied by the page. (Though 
      we will support Access Keys we are not able to do this at this time)
