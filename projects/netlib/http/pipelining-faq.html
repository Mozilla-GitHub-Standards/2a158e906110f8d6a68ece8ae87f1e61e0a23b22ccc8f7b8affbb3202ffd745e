<h1>HTTP/1.1 Pipelining FAQ</h1>

<h2>What is HTTP pipelining?</h2>

<p>Normally, HTTP requests are issued sequentially, with the next
request being issued only after the response to the current request has been
completely received. Depending on network latencies and bandwidth limitations,
this can result in a significant delay before the next request is <em>seen</em> 
by the server.</p>

<p>HTTP/1.1 allows multiple HTTP requests to be written out to a socket together
without waiting for the corresponding responses. The requestor then waits
for the responses to arrive in the order in which they were requested. The
act of <em>pipelining</em> the requests can result in a dramatic improvement
in page loading times, especially over high latency connections.</p>

<p>Pipelining can also dramatically reduce the number of TCP/IP packets. With a
typical MSS (maximum segment size) in the range of 536 to 1460 bytes, it is
possible to pack several HTTP requests into one TCP/IP packet. Reducing the
number of packets required to load a page benefits the internet as a whole, as
fewer packets naturally reduces the burden on IP routers and networks.</p>

<p>HTTP/1.1 conforming servers are required to support pipelining. This does
not mean that servers are required to pipeline responses, but that they are
required to not fail if a client chooses to pipeline requests. This obviously
has the potential to introduce a new category of evangelism bugs, since no
other popular web browsers implement pipelining.</p>

<h2>When should we pipeline requests?</h2>

<p>Only idempotent requests can be pipelined, such as GET and
HEAD requests. POST and PUT requests should not be pipelined. We also should
not pipeline requests on a new connection, since it has not yet been determined
if the origin server (or proxy) supports HTTP/1.1. Hence, pipelining can
only be done when reusing an existing <em>keep-alive</em> connection.</p>

<h2>How many requests should be pipelined?</h2>

<p>Well, pipelining many requests can be costly if the connection
closes prematurely because we would have wasted time writing requests to
the network, only to have to repeat them on a new connection. Moreover,
a longer pipeline can actually cause user-perceived delays if earlier requests
take a long time to complete. The HTTP/1.1 spec does not provide any guidelines
on the ideal number of requests to pipeline. It does, however, suggest a
limit of no more than 2 <em>keep-alive</em> connections per server. Clearly,
it depends on the application. A web browser probably doesn't want a very
long pipeline for the reasons mentioned above. 2 may be an appropriate value,
but this remains to be tested.</p>

<h2>What happens if a request is canceled?</h2>

<p>If a request is canceled, does this mean that the entire
pipeline is canceled? Or, does it mean that the response for the canceled
request should simply be discarded, so as not to be forced to repeat the
other requests belonging to the pipeline? The answer depends on several
factors, including the size of the portion of the response for the canceled
request that has not been received. A naive approach may be to simply cancel
the pipeline and re-issue all requests. This can only be done because the
requests are idempotent. This naive approach may also make good sense since
the requests being pipelined likely belong to the same load group (page)
being canceled.</p>

<h2>What happens if a connection fails?</h2>

<p>If a connection fails or is dropped by the server partway
into downloading a pipelined response, the web browser must be capable of
restarting the lost requests. This case could be naively handled equivalently
to the cancelation case discussed above.</p>
