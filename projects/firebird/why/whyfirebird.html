        <p>

                <strong>Tab Browsing</strong>
                <table align="right" class="featureIcon" width="210">
                  <td><img class="featureIconImage" src="shot-tabs-1b.png" width="200" height="152"

                </table>
                <p>Firebird&trade; makes browsing <i>easier than ever before</i> with best Tab-Browsing around. 
                Tab browsing changes the way you use the internet by allowing you to open links on a page in 
                <i>background "Tabs"</i> and then read them when you're ready. No confusing new windows, no need
                for context menus, just hold down <strong>Ctrl</strong> when clicking a link, or use your
                <strong>middle mouse button</strong> (if you have one). Tab-Browsing is central to Firebird&trade;, 
                you can set your home page to be a group of Tabs. You can open an entire folder of bookmarks in Tabs. 
                
                <table align="left" class="featureIcon" width="210">
                  <td><img class="featureIconImage" src="shot-tabs-2.png" width="200" height="75"

                  opens contents of Bookmarks Folder in Tabs</strong></td>
                </table>                  
                <p>Browsing with Tabs makes browsing the internet faster and more efficient. You can concentrate
                on reading each page without the confusion of having to switch between windows. As you're
                reading each page, links you have opened in background Tabs load, so when you're ready to read
                <i>them</i> they've already loaded and you don't need to wait. 
                
                <p>While it seems like a simple idea, Tab-Browsing is a revolutionary enhancement to 
                browsing the internet. Firebird&trade; brings you the simplest, most intuitive version of 
                Tab Browsing you will find.

                <p>Firebird&trade; makes it easier to organize your Bookmark collection with its handy Bookmarks
                manager (<strong>Bookmarks, Manage Bookmarks...</strong> menu item). Create folders to group
                similar items, and add annotations to remind yourself of why you bookmarked a particular item
                later. Sort on any of a number of properties including Name, Location, Date Last Visited, etc. 
                Firebird&trade; also lets you associate a Keyword with any bookmark so you can open it by simply
                typing its keyword in the Location Bar of the browser. 
                <p>Both Bookmarks and History are available as convenient Side Bar panels for quick access. Simply
                hit <strong>Ctrl+B</strong> for Bookmarks, and <strong>Ctrl+H</strong> for History. Links open
                with a click.

                tickers, and spoofing that prevents you from seeing where links really go). We've designed 
                Firebird&trade; so that the <em>standard settings</em> offer the <em>least annoyance</em>. 
                Controls for these settings can be found in the <strong>Web Features</strong> page under

                <p>Firebird&trade;'s "Find Stuff Faster" mantra is more than just skin deep. Other parts of the

                <p>We place a great deal of importance on space for web pages in Firebird&trade;, that's why Firebird&trade;
                has more space devoted to web pages than Internet Explorer, Opera, or Mozilla. Firebird&trade; offers
                2% more space to web pages than Mozilla, 4% more than Internet Explorer, and a whopping 10% more than 
                Opera. (Standard configurations tested, sidebars closed, window maximized at 1600x1200). You can get even
                more space by rearranging the content of the toolbars. Firebird&trade; also offers a Full Screen mode
                (Press <strong>F11</strong> to enter/exit) that devotes even more of the screen to the web page.

                <strong>Simplified User Interface</strong>
                <p>We've put a lot of thought into making using Firebird&trade; easy and obvious. Browsers like Mozilla and 
                Opera seem to be focused more on esoteric features, at the expense of all-round usability. That's why we 
                have created a browser that works in the <strong>simplest</strong> and <strong>most straight-forward</strong>
                way out of the box. Defaults have been carefully chosen so you don't <em>need</em> to spend time setting up
                the browser. Menus and dialog boxes are kept clean and free of options that only a marginal number of people
                use. If there's a feature that Mozilla or Opera has that Firebird&trade; lacks, it's probably for good reason. 
                But if you really do need a particular enhancement, a large number of quality 
                <a href="http://www.texturizer.net/firebird/extensions.html">extensions</a> are available for free.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Personalize With Themes</strong>
                <table align="right" class="featureIcon" width="160">
                  <td><img class="featureIconImage" src="themes.gif" width="81" height="52" 
                  alt="Themes Panel Icon" <br><strong class="featureCaption">Jazz up your browser with stylish Themes</strong></td>
                </table>                  
                <p>Firebird&trade; supports a large number of <a href="http://www.texturizer.net/firebird/themes.html">quality 
                themes</a> which can be downloaded for free. These themes can change the appearance of everything from the browser
                window, to dialog boxes, buttons, menus, etc. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>Industry Leading Standards Support</strong>
                <p>Firebird&trade; has industry leading support for W3C standards like CSS, DOM, etc. Where browsers like 
                Opera may fail on a dynamic page, Firebird&trade; usually succeeds. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>Fast to Get, Fast to Use</strong>
                <p>Less than 3 minutes to download over a broadband connection, Firebird&trade; can be yours in no time at all. 
                Firebird&trade; starts up and runs much faster than Mozilla because of its significantly optimized code.
