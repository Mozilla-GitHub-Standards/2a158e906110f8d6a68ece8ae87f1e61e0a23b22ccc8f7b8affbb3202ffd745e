<h1>Phoenix Advantages</h1>

This is an incomplete list of Phoenix advantages compiled with help from 
Phoenix users and developers at the mozillaZine Phoenix forum.

<h2>Features</h2>

<!-- section 1 -->
<h3>Customizable toolbars</h3>
<p>Phoenix' customizable toolbars allow you to add and remove items (buttons,
search field, bookmarks, etc.) to the toolbars as well as create new toolbars.
This allows users to move all of their toolbar items to a single toolbar or
spread them out over several toolbars. In addition, Phoenix toolbars support
large and small icons and icons+text, icons only and text only modes.</p>

<h3>Extension management</h3>
<p>Phoenix was designed to be lean and fast with a complete feature set for
_most_ users. That means that it doesn't include some niche or power features
that Mozilla users have come to expect. In order to meet the needs of many
categories of users, Phoenix has implemented a simple mechanism for management
of extensions and encouraged the community to build additional functionality as
extensions, add-ons, plugins outside of the core app. Phoenix currently
supports the enabling and disabling of installed extensions as well as a clean
extension preferences API so that extensions can have their own settings
without polluting the Phoenix browser preferences. Phoenix has plans for
extension uninstall to round out its extension story but this hasn't happened
yet.</p>

<h3>Faster and more convenient sidebar</h3>
<p>The Phoenix sidebar is a rewrite of the Mozilla sidebar which is much faster
and more convenient. It supports three default panels: downloads, history and
bookmarks. Each sidebar can be opened from the View menu, a keyboard shortcut
or an optional toolbar button. Phoenix only displays one sidebar at a time
unlike Mozilla's sidebar which can be so full with headers for other panels
that there's hardly any room for the active panel's content.</p>

<h3>More familiar keyboard shortcuts</h3>
<p>The Phoenix keyboard shortcuts have been modified to be more familiar to
users of other popular browsers like IE.</p>

<h3>In-line form auto-complete</h3>
<p>The new auto-complete mechanism, used in both the URL bar and in HTML forms
on web pages, is faster and easier to use than Mozilla's URL auto-complete plus
wallet functionality. In-line auto-complete for html forms in web pages (like IE
has) makes filling in forms a snap.</p>

<h3>Search on the toolbar</h3>
<p>Phoenix has a sherlock/mycroft extensible search field on the toolbar making
search even more accessible and convenient. The field can be moved to any
toolbar or removed completely. It supports "find in page", google and dmoz.org
and can be extended to hundreds of other search engines with the click of a
link at mycroft.mozdev.org.</p>

<h3>Easier Preferences management</h3>
<p>The Phoenix Options window puts the most often used preferences into 7
convenient panels, each with a descriptive icon selector. Putting the most
important preferences in front of the user rather than burying them in a mix
of about 50 panels and many hundreds of options makes configuring Phoenix
considerably more convenient than Mozilla. For the power user that must tweak
every available preference, there is a mozdev extension called preferential or
an editable about:config page.</p>

<h3>Bookmarks undo/redo and improved favicon support.</h3>
<p>Phoenix bookmarks are leaps and bounds ahead of Mozilla's with support for
undo/redo as well as favicons for bookmarks in the personal toolbar and
bookmarks menu.</p>

<h3>Quicksearch for history and bookmarks</h3>
<p>Phoenix adopted the idea "quicksearch" or "filtering" from Mozilla Mail and
added it to the bookmarks and history manager and sidebars.</p>

<h3>More convenient menu structure</h3>
<p>The Phoenix menu structure is much cleaner, more navigable and in line with
other popular applications. That there are no confusing Composer, MailNews and
Addressbook (and others) menus mixed in with the browser menus saves users time
and makes migration from other apps easier.</p>

<h3>Bookmark groups for the masses</h3>
<p>Phoenix allows a user to launch any folder of bookmarks into tabs. This
encourages users to keep bookmarks organized and greatly improves the
discoverability of the feature while cutting down on the confusion between
"groups" and "folders" that exists in Mozilla.</p>

<h3>Personal toolbar overflow</h3>
<p>Phoenix supports toolbar overflow so if you have more personal toolbar items
than fit on the toolbar it will overflow into a menu.</p>

<h3>Global History in Go menu</h3>
<p>The Go menu contains a global history list for quick access to more than just
the session history.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Theme Switching</h3>
<p>Themes in Phoenix switch without a restart of the browser. This was nearly
impossible in Mozilla because of dataloss issues that don't plague a simple
browser like Phoenix.</p>

<h3>Discrete Profiles</h3>
<p>Phoenix doesn't present users with a Profile Manager by default, leaving that
up to the OS. In addition, Phoenix stores its profile data independently of
Mozilla and Netscape so there are no negative interactions like there are
between Netscape and Mozilla.</p>

<h3>"Clear all" for privacy settings</h3>
<p>With a single click (and a confirmation) users can clear all privacy data 
including form data, history, cache, cookies, etc.</p>

<h3>Fresh and attractive UI look and feel</h3>
<p>The Phoenix look is crisp, fresh and attractive and includes all of the
expected toolbar icons as well as new icons for the Bookmarks manager and 
Options panels.</p>

<h3>More friendly pop-up blocking</h3>
<p>Phoenix pop-up blocking and simple whitelist mechanism is easier to use than
the complex mozilla mix of blacklisting and whitelisting.

<h3>Better performance</h3>
<p>In my testing, Phoenix has a 30-40% startup improvement over
Mozilla/Netscape and a 40-50% new window improvement over Mozilla/Netscape.</p>

<h3>Smaller download size, disk footprint and memory usage</h3>
<p>Phoenix is nearly half the download size of Mozilla (6MB download compared
to 11MB for windows) and it continues to shrink while Mozilla gets bigger.</p>
<p>Phoenix is about half the size on disk as Mozilla (about 12.4MB on disk
compared to 24MB for Mozilla.) As Phoenix developers continue to remove unused
or unwanted code this number will continue to improve.</p>
<p>Phoenix also takes up about 15% less RAM than Mozilla (18MB runtime for
Phoenix compared to 21MB for Moz on windows.)</p>

<!-- section 2 -->
<h2>Themes and Extensions</h2>

<h3>More themes</h3>
<p>Because Phoenix is just a browser, the theme developers have a much easier
time building themes for Phoenix than for Mozilla. Today there are more than 50
themes already available for Phoenix and that number is growing fast. See
http://texturizer.net/phoenix/themes.html for a good collection.</p>

<h3>Great extensions</h3>
<p>Phoenix developers aren't accepting every single feature that every user
wants. This has led to the development of many useful add-ons, extensions or
plugins. In addition, converting Mozilla extensions to Phoenix is fairly easy
and well documented so many have been converted. There are over 30 popular
extensions for Phoenix available at
http://texturizer.net/phoenix/extensions.html</p>

<!-- section 3 -->
<h2>User Support Community</h2>

<h3>MozillaZine Phoenix Forums</h3>
<p>The Phoenix Forums at MozillaZine are considerably more active than the
Mozilla forums especially in the theme and extension development forums.</p>

<h3>Phoenix Help</h3>
<p>David Tenser and others have set up a wonderful Phoenix support site called
"Phoenix Help" which includes an amazing array of resources for Phoenix users
including an up-to-date keyboard shortcut map designed to help users migrate
from alternative browsers to Phoenix, a mouse shortcut listing, a Tips and
Tricks section and a menu reference. In addition the help site also includes an
up-to-date user FAQ, Tips for customizing, a Themes section and an Extensions
section.</p>

<!-- section 4 -->
<h2>Development</h2>

<h3>XUL pre-processor</h3>
<p>The XUL pre-processor allows Phoenix to make simple platform differences and 
provides a simple mechanism for issues like building a testing UI which might 
include debug menus, etc. and building a release UI that doesn't.</p>

<h3>Strong Module Ownership/Leadership</h3>
<p>Phoenix ownership/leadership will ensure that the UI doesn't try to please 
everyone and end up pleasing no one.</p>

<h3>Working toward a real toolkit</h3>
<p>Phoenix developers have as a goal (and have started work on this) to make a
clear separation between the toolkit layer and the application layer. This kind 
of organization should make XUL app development in general and Phoenix 
development easier and more maintainable.</p>
