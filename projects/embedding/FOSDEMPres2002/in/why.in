<li>Mozilla is open source.</li>
<li>Mozilla has strong browser technology and standards expertise.</li>

Embedding motivation comes from...
<ul>
<li>users having more browser related feature needs than browser distributors can provide.</li>
 <ul>
  <li><u>Features</u> - such as MDI browser windows, and native UI.</li>
  <li><u>Functionality</u> - various, traditionally non-browser, applications need browser functionality.</li>
  <li><u>Custom Devices</u> - non-desktop devices often need to strip down the browser; "shrink to fit."</li>
