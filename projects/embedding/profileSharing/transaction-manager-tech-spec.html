<h1 align="center">Transaction Manager Tech Spec</h1>

<h4>Summary</h4>
         
<blockquote>The transaction manager is the core piece of the entire profile 
  sharing architecture described in the <a
 href="./shared-profile-tech-spec.html">Shared Profile Tech Spec</a>. (<a
 href="./index.html">profile sharing tech doc homepage</a>) It will be in
  charge of communication between gecko processes. This document describes
 the architecture to be used for the manager itself.<br>
     </blockquote>
         
<h4>Requirements</h4>
         
<ul>
       <li>enable multiple processes to notify each other</li>
       <li>serve as a messaging system between gecko processes</li>
       <li>allow processes to specify the particular types of messages they 
 are  interested in</li>
       <li>allow processes to register to get messages</li>
      <li>provide a way for 2 processes to communicate directly with each 
other  (match-maker service) ?<br>
      </li>
         
</ul>
         
<h4>Design</h4>
       
<ul>
      <li>The transaction manager will be run out of process and communicate
   via an IPC mechanism. It will coordinate the messaging aspect of profile
    sharing, namely it will receive from a process a message describing a
change     to the profile data. That message will then be relayed to all
processes   who  have registered as a listener for the profile subsystem
that is being   modified.  Only a system interested in the specific change
will be notified   of that change. Processes registered to listen for preference
changes will   not get messages about  cookie changes.</li>
               
  <ul>
        <li>It makes sense to separate the different levels of support into 
   base classes to allow for reuse. In particular, a system that only wants 
   to set up a pipe to a single system shouldn't incur the costs inherent 
in   a broadcast model. A top level base class may only be able to mediate 
the   exchange between 2 processes by setting up a channel between the two 
processes    and then stepping out of the way and letting them talk directly 
to each  other.  A second level might hold handles to processes that have 
registered  as a certain type of app ( i.e. mail, IM... ) and processes that 
need to talk to a specific type of app can get a connection made through this
type of service. A third could implement the broadcast model described in
this document. Yet another could be more specific to profile data and include
some knowledge about the type of data being transferred. Perhaps by further
granulating the type of changes &nbsp;in which a process is interested (if
that makes  sense) or controlling access to files and handing out file handles
etc...</li>
               
  </ul>
      <li>Transaction Service Public Interface: - The important thing   to
  remember  is that this is a messaging service, like the post office (except 
 without the losing or mangling of mail or long lines at lunchtime). It should
   have  little  (if any)  knowledge of what it is passing back and forth.
Now that I think about it  more, the public API is really the format of the
messages and the types of  things you can register for. Things messages must
be able to indicate:</li>
           
  <ul>
       <li>post a message to a particular queue</li>
       <li>see if a queue is in use (people are registered)</li>
       <li>get all messages for a queue</li>
       <li>indicate a process is starting up and it needs messages from a 
certain  queue (needs to deny any posts to that queue until all current messages 
are  delivered to new process</li>
       <li>indicate a proscess is shuting down and needs to update before 
writing  to disk (same problem as above)</li>
       <li>send a message to a particular type of listener (in the case of
 wanting to communicate with the mail program etc)</li>
       <li>register as a particular type of listener (as in above, register 
 as a mail program)<br>
       </li>
           
  </ul>
     <li>TM internal (private) methods:<br>
     </li>
           
  <ul>
       <li>Init()</li>
       <li>AddTransactionListener(QueueID, PID(?), nsISupports*) - the queue 
 to add the process to and a pointer back to the object that cares. (this 
is who will get called with the notification that a message is available)</li>
       <li>RemoveTransactionListener(QueueID, PID(?), nsISupports*)</li>
       <li>PostTransaction(TransType, Message)</li>
       <li>RecieveTransaction(TransType, Message)<br>
       </li>
       <li>Shutdown()</li>
       <li>IsQueueEmpty()</li>
           
  </ul>
     <li>The TM will have to be able to monitor several different IPC connections 
 at the same time and must be able to synchronize the messages received from 
 different sources. An alternative could be to have all incoming traffic arrive
 on the same IPC connection, that way requests for info, or posts for changes
 will just be streamed in one at a time (effectively making the receive()
method synchronized). Depending on the IPC mechanism used this may or may
not be possilbe. We are looking into using a new IPC mechanism written by
Netscapers for use with a new PSM module. We are not sure when that will
land in Mozilla, or if it will meet our needs. jgaunt is going to look at
the IPC code and rpotts is checking into the landing plans for the PSM module.</li>
     <li>Internal data structure - the TM will need to keep track of:</li>
       
  <ul>
      <li>what processes have started up and attached to the TM as possible
 listeners to things</li>
      <li>what processes are actually registered listeners</li>
      <li>what queue(s) each process is listeneing to</li>
      <li>what queues are in existence and how many processes attached to 
each</li>
      <li>particular process types ( mail, browser, aim, addressbook etc
)</li>
      <li>IPC connections to each process</li>
      <li>messages in each queue</li>
      <li>For each process, a top of queue index for each queue it is registered
 for</li>
      <li>name? version? type (pref/cookie/etc)?<br>
      </li>
       
  </ul>
    <li>Each message will need to keep track of ( or the queue will need
to  for each message )</li>
       
  <ul>
      <li>owning process</li>
      <li>message type (a pref queue can have addpref, removed pref, resetpref
 ... )<br>
      </li>
      <li>message data</li>
      <li>ref count<br>
      </li>
       
  </ul>
       
</ul>
       
<h4>Use Cases</h4>
     
<blockquote>These use cases are going to take into account a slightly wider 
 range of topics than covered in the Shared Profile Tech Doc. They deal with 
 the specific cases of the programmatic use of the TM. These use cases should 
 flush out any issues or expose dangerous areas touched by the TM. Specifically 
 we are paying attention to the interaction between processes, with startup 
 and shutdown being the most dangerous times for data corruption.</blockquote>
       
<ul>
      <li>Startup - From the TM point of view, this step is very simple.
When  a process that is set up to use shared profile data begins, it will
launch  the TM. The TM will merely initialize itself and listen for a request
from  a process wanting to add itself to a transaction list.</li>
      <li>Shutdown - During the process of removing a process from the listener
 list, a check will be made to see if the process is going away and then
a  check needs to be made to see if there are any processes "attached" to
the  TM without being on a list. If there are no processes even "attached"
then  the TM will shutdown, cleaning up after itself, of course.</li>
      <li>Initialization of TM - Basically just setup of any data structures
 to be prepared to receive messages and then blocking (or something) on a
socket or waiting for whatever IPC mechanism we go with.</li>
      <li>Adding message listeners - This will be initiated by a message
via  IPC. Enough info will need to be in the message to be able to return
a message  to the process interested, either a handle to the pipe/socket
or perhaps a PID.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Removing message listeners - Again, initiated by a message via
IPC.  The listener specified will be removed from the list of interested
processes  for a specified queue.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>receiving messages - if we can have all processes attach to a single
 pipe in to the TM, that would be ideal. This may be the final step of initialization,
 or the next step following initialization (it probably doesn't matter).
When  a message comes in, the type of message needs to be deteremined (add/rem
listener, post message to queue, startup, shutdown, get messages from queueu...
). The type will be stripped from the message and the rest of the information
 will be passed along, intact (not parsed yet) to the corresponding helper
 function.</li>
       
  <ul>
      <li>if a message is posted to a list with only the owner subscribed,
 a refcount of -1 will be set, to indicate that the message has been posted
 and not flushed to disk yet, but no other processes were around when it
was  posted. Any processes that start up, or attach to the queue before the
change  has been written out to disk will pick up this message, but not delete
it.  Messages with refcount of -1 will be removed only once written to disk.</li>
     <li>If there is more than just the owner  watching     the   queue 
   the   ref  count will be set to the number of  processes  -  1 ( for 
 the owner).    When  the  ref count reaches 0 the  process that   set the
  ref   count to 0 will   be responsible  for removing  the transaction 
 from  the queue  and adjusting    any remaining transactions.</li>
       
  </ul>
    <li>broadcasting messages - when a message is posted to a queue all the
 listeners for that queue need to be notified. Using the IPC we will either
 send the message itself to each process, or send a notification that new
messages are available and allow the process to fetch them at their leisure.</li>
    <li>clean queue - after a process has written its state to the disk,
any  lingering -1 processes need to be removed from the queue. The trigger
from  this may be a special "I'm going to write out" retrieve messages message,
 or it may be a seperate message itself.</li>
   <li>There needs to be a way for a process to get he notification of messages 
and it will depend on the IPC mechanism. We may have to have a thread block 
on the socket, or we may have to poll, or we may have to have a platform specific
way of doing it to avoid all of the above. Something that automagically just
posts events to the main gui thread is, I think, preferable. Again, this
all depends on the IPC system.<br>
   </li>
        
</ul>
    <br>
    THIS DESIGN IS COPIED FROM THE OLD PREFERENCES TECH SPEC AND IS IN THE
 PROCESS  OF BEING UPDATE -jgaunt 9/26<br>
       
<ul>
      <li>A transaction queue will be used to notify   other    processes 
     of  changes   in shared prefs.</li>
               
  <ul>
                         
    <ul>
                       
    </ul>
               
  </ul>
               
  <ul>
             
    <ul>
                       
    </ul>
                       
    <ul>
                       
    </ul>
        <li>The new system will not use shared memory at all.</li>
     <li>the new system might use semaphores, but it remains to be seen if 
they will be needed. The hope is that they will NOT be needed, but reality 
may smack us down on that one.<br>
     </li>
     <li>There are several patterns of access for   the   shared    memory:</li>

          <li>Runtime removal of shared data listener - a  component    
of  a program shuts down and no longer needs the transaction  notifications. 
    Does not bring it's current state up to date with what  is in the transaction
      queue. Writes it's state out to disk JUST LIKE SHUTDOWN, a question
remains      in my mind about us writing to disk if we are &nbsp;just closing
down  a  portion  of the program that was interested in transactions. XXX
