<h2> Introduction</h2>
 
<p>This page describes the *nix variation of the GRE Installer and Uninstaller.
<br>
</p>
<p>This section primarily deals with the Linux OS. Implementation on other
 *nix platforms follows along similar lines with perhaps the only difference
 being the location of the global GRE directory. </p>
 
<h2> Location, Location, Location</h2>
  Ideally, the GRE will be located in a global/well-known directory. This
is the best way to facilitate application sharing of a GRE in much the same
way that shared libs and such are stored in well-known locations.  Because
the mozilla installer uses /usr/local/mozilla as a default install  location,
I propose that we go with /usr/local/mozilla/gre as the toplevel directory
 for the GRE. /usr/local can be written only by a root user (the presumption
 is that the GRE will never need to create anything where it is installed,
 e.g., component registries are located in the application directory, not
the GRE directory, so running GRE applications as non-root is ok). However
we should avoid making the installer suid root due to potential security issues.
We could use a simple non-suid Bourne shell script (or the equivalent body
of C code) to prompt the user for root password so that the installer can
be run as root, e.g.,  
<pre>#!/bin/sh<br><br>stty -echo<br>if [ $EUID -ne 0 ]<br>then&nbsp;&nbsp; # check to see if we are root<br>&nbsp; echo "In order to install the GRE, we recommend that you become root."<br>&nbsp; echo "Would you like to become root (y/n)?"<br>&nbsp; read -n 1 result<br>&nbsp; if [ $result = "y" ] || [ $result = "Y" ]<br>&nbsp; then<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo "Please enter your password at the prompt."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; su -c $PWD/greinstall<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if&nbsp; [ $? -ne&nbsp; 0 ] # su will prompt, then run the following command if login as root is successful<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo "You failed to login, perhaps because you mistyped the root password."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fi<br>&nbsp; else<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $PWD/greinstall<br>&nbsp; fi<br>else<br>&nbsp; $PWD/greinstall<br>fi<br>stty echo<br><br></pre>
  Note, this sort of thing could be used by the Linux/Unix native stub installer
 as well to facilitate installation of mozilla in a more global location.
 
<p>The installer itself would call geteuid(2) to see if it is executing with
root permissions or not. If executing as root, it will write to /usr/local/mozilla/gre
(if necessary), independent of the install location of the GRE-based app.
 Otherwise, it will drop the GRE (if necessary) into the install directory
 chosen by the user for the GRE-based app. When I say "if necessary", I mean
the GRE portion of the installer will look in /usr/local/mozilla/gre for
a compatible GRE before it decides to create one in /usr/local/mozilla/gre,
or in the application install directory. If a compatible GRE is found, installing
one below the application directory is not necessary. Nor is installing a
duplicate copy below /usr/local/mozilla/gre.</p>
 
<p>Regardless of where the GRE is installed, bookkeeping data needs to be
maintained alongside the GRE. We need to store version information, refcount
information, location of the GRE files (usually /usr/local/mozilla/gre), and
possibly other administrivia. <br>
</p>
<h2>A Word About Version Numbers</h2>
This probably applies to Windows too.<br>
<br>
Version numbers are supposed to mean something. They are supposed to indicate
compatibility. Version 2.0 is a major change, and is not guaranteed to be
compatible with 1.0 or 1.2 or 1.17. Version 1.1, on the otherhand, should
be compatible with 1.0.1, 1.2, and so forth. The way things look at this point,
getting all spun up about version numbers is pointless. Mozilla interfaces
are about as frozen as a hot tamale in Mexico City. In the middle of summer.
At noon. :-) At least, they are as far as version numbers go.<br>
<br>
So, we should adopt a versioning scheme that is reasonable for the situation,
and maps to mozilla milestones until compatibility can be measured, tested,
and guaranteed. GRE 1.2 is the set of libraries that shipped with Mozilla
1.2. And so forth. GRE 1.2.1 might be those same libraries based on a branch
of Mozilla 1.2, or maybe we just call it GRE 1.2 as well. <br>
<br>
In terms of Linux, version numbers are applied to the directory that contains
the gre. The files themselves contain no versioning information, and do not
get named in a way to advertise their version like .so files typically are
in Unix land. <br>
<br>
Look at it this way; before GRE, the files were duplicated and stored in the
directory along with the application. Now, we will be going one step further,
and pushing these files to a global directory where they can be shared against
multiple apps. For the time being, I expect all gre versions to be incompatible
and take on major version numbers. So, we will go from 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0
pretty quickly if we try and assign a numbering scheme based on version compatibility.
In a year's time, and with mozilla releases every 5 weeks, we will reach
version 17. Not exactly a good thing. Without collecting data about compatibility,
and freezing interfaces, I am positive this will be the case. So, if you
want real version numbers, start freezing your interfaces. Now that we have
a GRE, there is finally a good reason to do this.<br>
<h2>GRE Registry, Refcounting, and Application Directory</h2>
The GRE registry is a directory underneath /etc/mozilla named, oddly enough,
gre. If /etc/mozilla or /etc/mozilla/gre don't exist, they are created. We
place gre under "mozilla" so we have room for expanding /etc/mozilla to other
uses beyond gre in the future. Within /etc/mozilla/gre, we create a file
for each gre that is installed on the system. The name of the file is simply
the name of the gre the file represents, concatenated to the string "gre",
e.g., "gre1.1". This file has the following organization: <br>
<br>
Version=1.1<br>
String=Mozilla GRE 1.1<br>
Refcount=3<br>
Location=/usr/mozilla/gre/1.1<br>
Uninstall=/usr/mozilla/gre/1.1/greuninstall<br>
App=AppID:/home/syd/mozilla<br>
App=AppID:/home/syd/netscape<br>
App=AppID:/home/syd/oeone<br>
...<br>
&lt;EOF&gt;<br>
<br>
<i>Version</i> is the numeric version of the GRE. <br>
<i>String</i> is some human readable version text. This text should not depend
on localization.<br>
<i>Refcount</i> is set to 0 when the GRE is installed without an application.
When installed with an application, or an application is installed that references
(shares) the GRE, the refcount is incremented by 1. If an application that
depends on the gre is uninstalled, the refcount is decremented by 1. If the
refcount, at this time, becomes less than or equal to 0, the gre pointed
to by <i>Location</i> is removed from the system. <br>
<i>Location</i> is the location of the gre files on the system.<br>
<i>Uninstall</i> is the location of the uninstaller for this gre.<br>
<i>App</i> is the unique identifier of an application that makes use of this
gre. When the gre installer is invoked, the application installer will specify
a unique id and the path the app was installed to as arguments to the gre
installer. The gre installer will take that id and append a <i>App</i> line
to the end of the gre registry file as a part of its operation. The app uninstaller
will also pass this unique id to the gre uninstaller stub. The gre uninstaller
stub will scan the gre files in /etc/mozilla/gre to find the file that contains
the specified id and identify which version of the gre the application is
using.<br>
<h2>Installing GRE from an Embedding  Application Installer</h2>
<b>Command-line Options for the Unix GRE Installer:</b><br>
 <br>
 The embedding application's installer must always invoke the GRE installer
using the following parameters (note, these mirror the current Windows args;
I may change them as reality becomes more clear):<br>
 <br>
 greinstall --app app_id --app_path path [--dd path] [--usage]<br>
 <br>
 The <b>app</b>, <b>app_path</b>, and <b>dd</b> arguments are described on
the Windows GRE install page. <b>--usage</b> spews out to stderr a summary
of the supported arguments.<br>
<br>
If the user is non-root, we install the gre files in the same location as
the application, and the registry data for that GRE is not updated.<br>
 
<h2>Uninstalling GRE from an Embedding Application Uninstaller</h2>
The GRE uninstaller consists of a generic stub, and an uninstaller that is
specific to the gre that is being uninstalled. The generic stub is located
next to the application, where it was installed, and is responsible for finding
the correct uninstaller and invoking it. It does this by taking the AppID
and path passed to it by the application uninstaller, and scanning the files
in /etc/mozilla/gre to locate the file with the corresponding <i>App</i>line.&nbsp;
It will decrement the <i>Refcount</i> in that file by 1, and remove the <i>App</i>
line from that gre file. It will then execute the uninstaller that is specified
by the <i>Uninstall</i>line if and only if the <i>Refcount</i>became less
than or equal to 0. If the <i>Refcount</i> becomes less than or equal to zero,
the uninstaller stub will also remove the gre file from the /etc/mozilla/gre
directory.&nbsp;
