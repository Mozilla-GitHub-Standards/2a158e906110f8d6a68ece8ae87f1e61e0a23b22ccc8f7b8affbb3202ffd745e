<div align="center"><big><big><b>Minimal Upgrades of GRE</b></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <b>Definition</b>: &nbsp;Besides full on upgrades there is a need to
upgrade  with minimal user impact in cases where 1) we need make small changes
to GRE that might have impact on the client and 2) we want to replace patching
in place with an installer solution. &nbsp;The key concern is to have a safe
 and convenient way to get incremental changes to the user without a) putting
 other apps--albeit, potentially only other apps in our suite of products--at
 risk and b) without unduly inconveniencing the user.<br>
    <br>
    The first case described above has special considerations since GRE is
 shared by multiple apps.  &nbsp;Even if we are able to do regression testing
 with certainty, there is  still an issue regarding the timing of the application
 of the patch. &nbsp;If  the apps themselves have been modified to depend
upon the new version of GRE then the first app to update itself and GRE could
render all other apps broken until they have been updated if the patch happens
"in place". &nbsp;Since  we are going to have to prepare for this eventuality
 anyway, we'd just as  well use the same mechanism in the second case (where
 patching in place could be used) &nbsp;as long as it is transparent to users.
 &nbsp;The installer will not need to maintain two different approacies to
 upgrading/patchin.<br>
    <br>
    So, I believe the requirements for minimal upgrades are as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <b>Requirements</b>:<br>
       
<ul>
     <li>1 meg limit on download.</li>
     <li>Once the new patched GRE is "in place" (however that gets accomplished)
  we don't want to put the user through another download bits if other apps
  ask for the patch.<br>
      </li>
     <li>Either all apps must be patched simultaneously or else one patch 
of GRE must NOT effect GRE's that other apps are using until such time as 
they  are ready for the patch.</li>
     <li>We can assume that disk space "is cheap". &nbsp;So having muliple
 copies  of the GRE (at least temporarily) is not a bad thing. &nbsp;What
we DON'T  want are big downloads.<br>
      </li>
     
</ul>
    <b>Proposed Solution</b>: &nbsp;I am going to assume that patching all
 apps  simultaneously is NOT the best solution. &nbsp;If someone would like
 to argue  that case, I'm very willing to reconsider. &nbsp;(BTW, it isn't
 that the information will not be available for the clients to figure out
how to patch--as I uderstand it, the only requirement is that the client
can find where the patch needs to be applied and that will be in the Windows
registry--it is that I don't think it is a good idea to put it on the apps
to try to coordinate the issues around making a change that will affect multiple
apps. &nbsp;If we decide that there is justification for doing this, the
mechanisms will all be in place to support that. &nbsp;The have to be there
for the GRE installer anyway.) &nbsp;Here is what I think will work:<br>
       
<ul>
     <li>The patching process will, just like an upgrade, download and launch
  an GRE installer.</li>
     <li>The GRE patch installer will be less than 1 meg in size (or will,
 itself,  download less than 1 meg to do its work? &nbsp;Is that acceptable?
 &nbsp;And,  I suppose, the real constraint has to take into account the
size  of the patch  to the client also, if the client is going to be patched
as  well.)</li>
     <li>The end result of running the GRE patch installer for the first
time   will be that a new version of GRE will exist in its own space on the
machine,   and all registry information will be updated accordingly both
for GRE itself   and for the app which called for it, just like for an upgrade
installation   of GRE.<br>
      </li>
     <li>After one app has launched the GRE patch installer for the first 
time  information will be recorded in a known location in the Windows registry
 such that subsequent applications can know that they do not need to download
 the installer again.</li>
     <li>The GRE patch installer will install itself or some subset of itself
  such that, following the initial installation of the GRE patch, subsequent
  apps can launch this to "install" the patch for themselves.</li>
     <li>When the last dependent app has launched the patch installer (or 
its  subset equivalent) the "pre-patched version" will be uninstalled.<br>
      </li>
     
</ul>
   <br>
  <br>
