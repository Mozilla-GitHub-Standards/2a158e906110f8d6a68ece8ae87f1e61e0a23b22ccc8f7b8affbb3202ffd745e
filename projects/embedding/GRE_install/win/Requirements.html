<div align="center"><big><big><b>GRE Installer Requirements</b></big></big><br>
Curt Patrick: &nbsp;curt@netscape.com<br>
</div>
<br>
<b>Overview:</b> &nbsp;<br>
<br>
GRE is a set of sharable dlls. &nbsp;Client products requiring GRE
will call the GRE installer from the client's installer.
&nbsp;Similarly, when   clients uninstall their uninstaller will call
the GRE uninstaller.  &nbsp;The   GRE installer/uninstaller will be
responsible to determine if  GRE needs to  be installed to the system,
removed from the system, upgraded,  etc. &nbsp;The    required
operations will be performed in such a way that  downloads and
installation times are minimized, and a specific version of GRE is never
removed if any   client is still dependent upon it.<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Users</b>:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Developers need a self-extracting self-launching exe
installer/uninstaller w/GUI.</li>
    <li>Apps need a command-line driven silent GRE
installer/unninstaller which they can launch from their own
installer/uninstaller. &nbsp;(Apps      will not install or uninstall
GRE directly, but will launch the GRE installer/uninstaller       which
we provide to do so.)</li>
    <li>When GRE is installed, a stub GRE installer for that version
will be installed with it, and the stub installer's location will be
published such that apps subsequently desiring to install that version
of GRE can have the option of launching the installer from disk rather
than downloading it.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Apps will be responsible for versioning in such a way  as to
take advantage of Talkback if they so desire. &nbsp;Since Talkback maps
symbols  against a single version number this means that apps which are
Talkback enabled  will need to provide a unique for to app for every
app_version/gre_version  combination.<br>
    </li>
    <li>For this release, we are only targeting Windows platforms.
&nbsp;(Okay, some other developers are looking into requirements for
other platforms,   but not me.)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Basic install requirements</b>:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Each version resides in its own space, both disk space  and
Windows registry   space.</li>
    <li>Apps must be able to find/differentiate specific  versions.</li>
    <li>GRE will be installed to a default path. &nbsp;Users and   apps
will be allowed to designate a different install path ONLY if that
version of GRE is not already residing on the machine.</li>
    <li>Apps may choose to install private copies of GRE versions,
but they  cannot be installed to the default disk path. &nbsp;For the 
purpose    of reinstalling,  or uninstalling they will be treated as a
different version    of GRE, i.e. other apps installing or uninstalling
the same version  will   not impact private copies.</li>
    <li>The uninstaller will NOT be added to the Windows "Add/Remove
Programs" list when GRE is installed by an app. &nbsp;Only when GRE is
installed by   a user will the uninstaller be added to "Add/Remove
Programs" list.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Upgrades</b>: </li>
  <ul>
    <li>New versions never overwrite existing versions (which  is
strongly implied when we say that every version  resides in its own
space.)<br>
    </li>
    <li>If an application asks to install a version of GRE which
already exists, the resulting install will be identical to the original 
install.    &nbsp;In most cases, this will mean a noop (except for
whatever   mechanism    is used to track what apps have dependencies on
this version   of GRE). &nbsp;If files have been corrupted, however,
this might need to  force a reinstall.</li>
    <li>When the installer is launched with a GUI (usually this  means
the user launched it, rather than an app) the option will be provided
to force reinstall of that version of GRE to allow for correcting GRE
installations which have become corrupted.<br>
    </li>
    <ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Uninstall requirements</b>:<a href="MinimalUpgrade.html"></a></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Versions of GRE which are no longer required by any
applications will be removed by the uninstaller.</li>
    <li>A request by one app to uninstall a version of GRE will   not
remove that version if other installed apps depend upon it.</li>
    <li>If the uninstaller is launched with a GUI, and if apps  which
are dependant on that version of GRE still reside on the machine,
the uninstaller will tell the user what apps are using that version of
GRE and     will NOT remove it. &nbsp;(So users get treated like apps.
&nbsp;They can    only remove a version of GRE if no other app depends
on it.)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<b>Open issues, questions, and suggestions</b>:<br>
<ul>
  <li>See <a href="MinimalUpgrade.html">MinimalUpgrade.html</a>&nbsp;about
upgrades versus patching.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The following has been suggested and seems like a good idea.
&nbsp;Should this be made a requirement?:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>An app should be able to tell the installer that it is  okay
to use  an older minor version of GRE if it is already available instead
of installing  the newer recommended version, in order to minimize
downloads.    &nbsp;Apps  that wanted to use this feature would "ship"
with the latest   version of GRE  but would have been certified against
older versions. &nbsp;(The  more I think about this, I believe this is
entirely in the domain of the app installer. &nbsp;The app installer
can tell by looking in the Windows registry what versions of GRE
available. &nbsp;As long as each version of GRE provides an installer,
the app can launch whatever GRE installer comes with the version of GRE
it wants to use, or can launch the GRE installer packaged with the
app's installer in the absence of an acceptable version of GRE on the
system.)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
