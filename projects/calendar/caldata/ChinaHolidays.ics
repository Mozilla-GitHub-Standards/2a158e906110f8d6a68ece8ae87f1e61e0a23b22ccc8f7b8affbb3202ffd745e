 of a great patriot poet of the then State of Chu during the Warring 
 States period (475-221 B.C.)\, Qu Yuan (Ch'u Yuan)\, who drowned himself 
 to protest his emperor who gave in to the bully State of Chin. For fear 
 that fish may consume his body\, people of Chu threw launched their boats 
 and started throwing rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves into the 
 river where he was drowned to feed the fish. Now the big event of dragon 
 boat contest may be a legacy of such activity. People today still eat the 
 bamboo-leave rice dumplings on the occasion today.

DESCRIPTION:中秋节：15th of the eighth lunar month\nIt is second only 
 to the Chinese New Year in significance. The moon on this day is the 
 fullest and largest to the eye. Viewing it by the whole family while 
 feasting on good wine\, fruits and moon-cakes features the night event. 
 There is also a beautiful story behind it. Children are told that there's 
 fairy on the moon living in a spacious but cold crystal palace with her 
 sole companion\, a jade rabbit. A heavenly general and friend would 
 occasionally pay her a visit\, bringing along his fragrant wine. She 
 would then dance a beautiful dance. The shadows on the moon made the 
 story all the more credible and fascinating to the young imaginative 
 minds.
