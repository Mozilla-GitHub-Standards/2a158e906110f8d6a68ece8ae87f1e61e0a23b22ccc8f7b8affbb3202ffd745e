<h1>Who we are</h1>

<dl>
 <dt>Daniel Boelzle, Developer, Project Lead (daniel DOT boelzle AT sun DOT com)</dt>
 <dd>Besides keeping track of the project, Daniel mainly focusses on 
  backend work (libical, RFC2445 conformity, remote protocols and the 
  like). He got involved into the project implementing the Sun Calendar 
  Server support. Daniel is a long term developer on OpenOffice.org and 
  thinks Sunbird/Lightning is the best completion to a full Open Source 
  Office suite. He is employed by Sun Microsystems
 </dd>

 <dt>Michael Buettner, Developer (michael DOT buettner AT sun DOT com)</dt>
 <dd>Mickey's main focus is on everything that could broadly be 
  categorized as the frontend, with occasional excursions scattered 
  throughout different parts of the project. Mickey is the founder 
  of the internationally awarded game development studio X-ample 
  Architecture Productions where he was primarily working as technical 
  architect and main programmer on several triple-A console game titles 
  such as "Mission: Impossible". He has a strong background in computer 
  graphics with a bias towards physically based realtime-rendering. 
  Mickey also belongs to the OpenOffice.org developer community and is 
  employed by Sun Microsystems
 </dd>

 <dt>Clint Talbert, Developer and QA (ctalbert DOT moz AT gmail DOT com)</dt>
 <dd>
  Clint Talbert works on iTIP (RFC 2446) based scheduling, Timezones, 
  and helps with the Calendar-QA efforts. He started thinking about 
  the project when he downloaded Thunderbird 0.5 and said, "This is 
  cool, but it needs a calendar". Shortly thereafter, he was 
  coincidentally hired by Simdesk to do just that. Currently we works 
  for the Mozilla Corporation on Firefox QA. He tries to keep his 
  calendars organized, but can't stop himself from polluting them 
  with test artifacts containing unusual recurrences in odd timezones.
 </dd>

 <dt>Philipp Kewisch, Developer (mozilla AT kewis DOT ch)</dt>
 <dd>
  Philipp initially found interest in the project during one of many QA
  testdays. That not being enough he looked for a way to contribute code
  to the project. Prefering to work with backend code, he started working
  with the Google Calendar API seeking to integrate it with the calendar
  project. In his remaining time, Philipp tries to find out how the theory
  of relativity affects the consistancy of pudding and other fun things
  you learn while studying physics. He is also employed at Sun Microsystems 
  as a part-time employee.
 </dd>

 <dt>Simon Paquet, Website/Localization coordinator (bugzilla AT babylonsounds DOT com)</dt>
 <dd>
  Simon is responsible for most of areas in the project that aren't 
  directly code-related. He maintains the project website and acts as 
  the liaison to the localization (l10n) community. He is also a 
  regular contributor to the 
  <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/calendar">Calendar development 
  blog</a>, where he posts status updates or release announcements. 
  He has also contributed some patches, but since he really can't code, 
  his contributions to the codebase are small and mostly trivial. He 
  became involved with the project when Sunbird was announced back in 2003. 
  Before that he was a major contributor to the Firefox QA team. In his 
  real life Simon works as a management consultant in Germany.
 </dd>

 <dt>Michiel van Leeuwen, Developer (mvl PLUS moz AT exedo DOT nl)</dt>
 <dd>
  Michiel contributes to various parts of the codebase. He tends to work 
  mostly on backend stuff and got involved in the project because he got 
  a Palm, and wanted to use it with his linux desktop. When he is not 
  hacking on the Calendar codebase, he also hacks on the Mozilla code 
  for cookies and permissions.
 </dd>

 <dt>Bruno Browning, Developer (browning AT uwalumni DOT com)</dt>
 <dd>
  Bruno only recently began contributing to the project, focussing 
  primarily on CalDAV and related areas. Timezones make his head 
  hurt, so he makes every effort to leave those to Clint. His 
  interest stems from years of (sometimes spectacularly) unsuccessful 
  attempts to juggle incompatible calendaring systems. His day job 
  at the University of Wisconsin-Madison involves a wide variety of 
  things, mostly having to do with technology and/or foreign languages.
 </dd>

 <dt>Christian Jansen, User Experience Lead (christian DOT jansen AT sun DOT com)</dt>
 <dd>
  Christian Jansen is an User Experience Engineer of the OpenOffice.org 
  team at Sun Microsystems. During the last eight years, he played a 
  major role in specifying the graphical user interface of OpenOffice.org. 
  Since one year he is the User Experience lead of the Mozilla Calendar 
  Project.
 </dd>

 <dt>Andreas Treumann, QA Engineer, (andreas DOT treumann AT sun DOT com)<dt>
 <dd>
  Andreas is part of PIM team at SUN Microsystems, where he is heading the
  QA efforts. Prior to working on the Calendar apps, he was doing quality 
  assurance work on StarOffice and OpenOffice.org.
 </dd>

 <dt>Martin Schroeder, QA Team Lead and Developer (mschroeder AT mozilla DOT x SLASH home DOT org)</dt>
 <dd>
  Martin coordinates the Calendar QA effort, organizes test days, triages 
  bug reports, and hopes to introduce more automated testing in the future. 
  When he finds time, he also tries to fix some bugs. Martin got involved 
  because he wanted to contribute to a Mozilla project, and the Calendar 
  project was an easy entry where he could participate in test days and fix 
  small bugs. At the moment, he is finishing his Computer Science studies 
  at the University of Wuerzburg in Germany.
 </dd>

 <dt>Mark Carson, Graphic Artist ( Mark AT MarkCarson DOT com)</dt>
 <dd>
  Mark designed the Sunbird logo and along with Chris Cook (and a lot of 
  community input) created the default theme for Sunbird. His follow-on 
  effort was a theme for Thunderbird called "Winstripe Unofficial" where 
  he collaborated with Scratch to make a Thunderbird skin to complement 
  the default Firefox  theme. He is currently designated as the 
  responsible party for Sunbird graphics (logo, icons, etc.).
  <p></p>
  His "day job" has very little to do with graphics. Outside of making an 
  odd logo or some icons for business or personal projects, he works as 
  a software engineering consultant and develops web-based applications. 
  He has lived in Hawaii for over a quarter of a century and has been 
  paid to do what he loves (coding, of course) for over 15 years.
 </dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="emeritus">Emeritus</h1>
<dl>
 <dt>Mike Potter, Former project leader (mikeypotter AT yahoo.com)</dt>
 <dd>
  As the first Project Manager for the Mozilla Calendar project, Mike 
  initiated the opening of source code from OEone, created the initial 
  web pages and source code locations, helped organize developers to 
  help fix bugs and managed releases of the software. Mike is currently 
  employed by <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe Systems Inc.</a> as 
  Program Manager.
 </dd>

 <dt>Mostafa Hosseini, Former project leader (mostafah AT axentra DOT com)</dt>
 <dd>
  Mostafa took over as project lead after Mike Potter left the project. 
  He introduced Sunbird, the standalone calendar application shortly 
  after Firefox and Thunderbird had taken off. Mostafa currently works at 
  <a href="http://www.axentra.com">Axentra (formerly OEone)</a> which is 
  the company which 
  <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/articles/article2069.html">donated 
  the Calendar code base to Mozilla</a>.
 </dd>

 <dt>Dan Mosedale, Former Lead Developer (dmose AT mozilla DOT org)</dt>
 <dd>
  Dan took over as lead developer, when Mostafa resigned. Having been 
  part of mozilla.org since its inception, Dan has been involved in many 
  different areas, including coding, toolsmithing, processes, and 
  community-building. These days he is employed by the 
  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com">Mozilla Corporation</a>, where he is 
  actively hacking on Mozilla Firefox.
 </dd>
