<h1>Bugzilla Status Update</h1>
<a href="http://www.everythingsolved.com/">Max Kanat-Alexander</a> and
<a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/developers/profiles.html">The Bugzilla Team</a>
<p><strong>Friday, September 30, 2005</strong></p>

<h2>Introduction and Updates</h2>

<p>OK! It's been a busy few months since our last Status Update, including a
lot of work toward the final release of Bugzilla 2.20, and our first release
of the 2.21 series, 2.21.1. We are also releasing a bug-fix release for the
2.18 series, 2.18.4. Though the 2.16 branch is still supported (for a 
short time), there was no 2.16 release required this time around.</p>

<p>As usual, we'd like to remind all Bugzilla administrators that to assist
them in keeping up-to-date with release announcements and security
advisories, we provide an ultra-low-volume administrator mailing list
(<a href="http://bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-full-long&amp;extra=announce">announce@bugzilla.org</a>). 
We advise all Bugzilla administrators to subscribe so they can keep up 
with important Bugzilla announcements.</p>

<p>Those looking to get involved with Bugzilla development may want to
consider joining the <a href="http://bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&amp;extra=developers">developers list (developers@bugzilla.org)</a>.
This list offers discussion on new features and issues. Developers are
invited to subscribe to the list. You may also want to read our 
<a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/contributor.html">Contributor's Guide</a>.</p>


<h2>New Releases</h2>

<h3>2.20</h3>

<p>At long last, we have released Bugzilla 2.20! 2.20 has all sorts of great
<a href="../releases/2.20/new-features.html">new features</a>.</p>

<p>2.20 is our first major release which has <em>not</em> been run on
bugzilla.mozilla.org before release. This is because the Mozilla Foundation
system administrators have been quite overwhelmed and haven't been able
to do the upgrade. We expect to eventually have 2.20 running on
bugzilla.mozilla.org, but it may be a few weeks or months before it
happens.</p>

<p>However, it is also our first major release that has been thoroughly
tested by the new Bugzilla QA Team, which you can read more about, further
down in this Status Update.</p>

<p>Also, many installations have used Bugzilla 2.20rc2, and we had almost no 
bugs reported against that version, increasing our confidence in the
stability of this release.</p>


<h4>Upgrading to 2.20</h4>

<p>Upgrading to 2.20 is the same as upgrading to any other version of
Bugzilla, and you can read the section of the 
<a href="../releases/2.20/release-notes.html">Release Notes</a>
called &quot;How to Upgrade From An Older Bugzilla&quot; for instructions.</p>

<p>In particular, remember to read through <em>all</em> the Release Notes,
from the version you are upgrading from to the version that you are upgrading
to. Certain new features require manual changes if you would like to use
them. And, if you have customized your Bugzilla, sometimes there are
manual changes you must make to be sure that your customizations stay 
around.</p>


<h4>PostgreSQL Support in 2.20</h4>

<p>One of the most-requested features of Bugzilla has been the ability
to support other databases, and so 2.20 is the first official release
to support a database other than MySQL. The first database that we are
supporting other than MySQL is 
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. Though support
for PostgreSQL is marked as &quot;experimental&quot; in 2.20, most of
the features do work.</p>

<p>Also included in Bugzilla 2.20 is a script to copy a Bugzilla database
between MySQL and PostgreSQL, <kbd>contrib/bzdbcopy.pl</kbd>. You can
read the file itself for instructions, but just remember that your PostgreSQL
Bugzilla installation and your MySQL Bugzilla installation have to be
<em>identical</em> versions of Bugzilla in order for it to work.</p>

<p>Particular thanks goes out to 
<a href="http://www.everythingsolved.com/">Max Kanat-Alexander</a>,
Tomáš Kopal, various PostgreSQL users, and all the Bugzilla 
reviewers for making PostgreSQL support a reality.</p>

<h3>2.21.1</h3>

<p>We've been doing some large code re-organization for 2.21.1, making
Bugzilla even easier to customize. In particular, 
<a href="http://www.async.com.br/">Async Open Source</a> has contributed
significant changes to the way that we handle products, components, versions,
milestones, and classifications in the code, which simplify the code
for both customizers and core Bugzilla developers.</p>

<p>There are quite a few nice enhancements in 2.21.1, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ability to do relative date searches by hour, in addition to
      days and other units of time.</li>
  <li>"Alias" added to the New Bug form, for those who can edit the 
      alias.</li>
  <li>Added a user preference for whether or not to go to the next bug
      in your list after submitting changes to a bug.</li>
  <li>Users can now actually <em>access</em> flag descriptions.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla will optionally convert BMP attachments into PNGs for you.</li>
  <li>The <kbd>CGI.pl</kbd> file is entirely gone.</li>
  <li>You can now edit the Status Whiteboard when you are changing
      multiple bugs at once.</li>
  <li>The <kbd>move.pl</kbd> script's functionality has been merged into
      <kbd>process_bug.cgi</kbd>.</li>
  <li>QuickSearch is now in perl instead of in JavaScript.</li>
  <li>There is now limited ability for multiple different projects to
      share one Bugzilla codebase with different data stores.</li>
  <li>New Bugzilla installations will use UTF-8 encoding for all pages.</li>
  <li>The way that groups work in the database has changed, and large-scale
      Bugzilla use should be much faster, as a result.</li>
  <li>The actual attachment data has been moved to a separate database
      table, separate from the attachments table. This should greatly
      improve searches on attachment information not related to the 
      attachment contents.</li>
  <li>You can now specify multiple emails, comma-separated, when setting
      the requestee of a flag.</li>
  <li>"Bug Creation Time" is now available in the Boolean Charts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.18.4</h3>

<p>This release fixes a few bugs reported to us, in addition to fixing
   one security issue.</p>

<p>This is the last 2.18 release where we considered non-critical bugs.
   All future releases on the 2.18 branch will fix only security or
   dataloss issues.</p>

<h2>The QA Team</h2>

<p>One of the new developments in the Bugzilla world is the Bugzilla 
QA Team, headed by Frederic Buclin (aka &quot;LpSolit&quot;). They
have been doing detailed tests on our major releases, before we release
them, to make sure that all our major features work.</p>

<p>Our QA team is composed entirely of volunteers -- if you'd like to
help out, contact LpSolit on IRC (irc.mozilla.org) in the 
<a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/qa-bugzilla">#qa-bugzilla</a> channel or by 
<a href="mailto:LpSolit&#64;gmail.com">email</a>. Helping out with
Bugzilla QA is a great, easy way to contribute to the Bugzilla Project.</p>


<h2>Release Schedules</h2>

<p>Our 2.20 release was behind schedule, but that was somewhat expected. As
an Open Source project, we rely totally on volunteer efforts to release
a version, and so sometimes we can't have hard release schedules. We
freeze the development tree every six months, but how long it takes to
release after that depends on a lot of factors, mostly how much development
we did in those six months, and thus how many bugs we find and fix during
the freeze.</p>

<p>One thing that contributed to the extended delay of the 2.20 release is
that we allowed some new feature development even after the freeze, and
also that our development time total on 2.20 was longer than six months.
We expect our next release, 2.22, to be quicker to release, as we've had
less time to develop on it. And future releases should stick more and more
to our freeze schedule.</p>

<p>Per our standard six-month plan, the 2.22 branch would have been frozen
on September 15. However, we couldn't freeze a 2.22 without having 2.20
released. Currently, the plan is to freeze 2.22 one month after the 
release of 2.21.1. That way, we have some time to react to feedback on
the 2.21 series, but we won't be extending the 2.22 release indefinitely.</p>

<p>Hopefully, then, within three months after the freeze for 2.22, we will
have a release. Hopefully, we'll have it even sooner than that, but as I said,
it's hard to determine that sometimes, with volunteer efforts.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see faster Bugzilla releases, the best way is to come
help out, yourself! To get started contributing to Bugzilla, you can
read the <a href="../docs/contributor.html">Contributor's Guide</a> and
the <a href="../docs/developer.html">Developer's Guide</a>.</p>


<h2>Oracle Support</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a> themselves are working with 
the Bugzilla team on porting Bugzilla to Oracle. We hope to have workable 
Oracle support by the release of Bugzilla 2.24. If you'd like to keep 
track of how it's going, CC yourself on the 
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=bz-oracle">Oracle
support tracking bug</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to help port Bugzilla to Oracle or any other database,
feel free to contact the <a href="http://bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&amp;extra=developers">developers
list (developers@bugzilla.org)</a>. Porting Bugzilla to a new database system
is usually easy, since we have a whole infrastructure in place for it.</p>


<h2>The Status of Bugzilla 2.16</h2>

<p>Bugzilla 2.16 has been locked-down to security fixes only for a long time.
Starting with the release of Bugzilla 2.22, Bugzilla 2.16 will no longer
be supported at all by the Bugzilla Project. We encourage all Bugzilla 
administrators to upgrade to Bugzilla 2.20 as soon as possible.</p>
