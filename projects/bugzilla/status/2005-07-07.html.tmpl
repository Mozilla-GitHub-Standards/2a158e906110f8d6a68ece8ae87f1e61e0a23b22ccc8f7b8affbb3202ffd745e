<h2>Introduction and Updates</h2>

<p>Welcome to the July 2005 Bugzilla Status Update, covering the status of
the Bugzilla project since the May 11th Update.</p>

<p>In this update we are pleased to announce the release of Bugzilla 2.20
Release Candidate 1 (rc1) and Bugzilla 2.18.2.</p>

<p>As usual, we'd like to remind all Bugzilla administrators that to assist
them in keeping up-to-date with release announcements and security
advisories, we provide an ultra-low-volume administrator mailing list
(<a href="http://bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-full-long&amp;extra=announce">announce&#64;bugzilla.org</a>). We advise all Bugzilla administrators to
subscribe so they can keep up with important Bugzilla announcements.</p>

<p>Those looking to get involved with Bugzilla development may want to
consider joining the <a href="http://bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?user=&amp;passw=&amp;func=lists-long-full&amp;extra=developers">developers list (developers@bugzilla.org)</a>.
This list offers discussion on new features and issues. Developers are
invited to subscribe to the list. You may also want to read our 
<a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/contributor.html">Contributor's Guide</a>.

<h2>New Releases</h2>

<h3>2.20rc1</h3>

<p>This release is a developer's release and is not recommended for
production use, but all existing users of the 2.19 development branch
are strongly encouraged to upgrade to 2.20rc1.  The 2.20rc1 release is
the culmination of the most active three months in Bugzilla development
history.  2.20rc1 resolves many bugs with the 2.19.3 release.</p>

<p>In particular, PostgreSQL support is considerably more stable than
it was in 2.19.3. There are still a few known bugs, but a PostgreSQL
Bugzilla should be usable for day-to-day work in small production 
environments.</p>

<p>We also have finally written up a list of the 
<a href="../releases/2.20/new-features.html">new features in 2.20</a>, so go 
look at them if you're curious as to exactly what new bells and whistles
we've added to Bugzilla.</p>

<p>The final 2.20 release will be shaped by your feedback on 2.20rc1
in the next week or two, so please do let us know your comments, either
by filing a bug or by telling the mozilla-webtools list/newsgroup. (Details
on how to access mozilla-webtools are on the <a href="../support/">Support
page</a>.</p>

<h3>2.18.2</h3>

<p>2.18.2 is our second bug-fix release for 2.18, and we encourage anybody
running 2.18 to update to 2.18.2.</p>

<p>In particular, you may notice that createaccount.cgi now works
even when the &quot;requirelogin&quot; parameter is turned on.</p>

<h3>New Features Since the Last Status Update</h3>

<p>In 2.20rc1, you can now localize the names that will be 
  displayed for Statuses and Resolutions. They are in
  global/field-descs.html.tmpl in the templates.</p>

<p>Other than that, we just fixed a lot of bugs!</p>

<h3>Trunk Checkins Since the Last Status Update</h3>

<p>You can see a list of all recent changes to Bugzilla code 
using the table on our <a href="changes.html">detailed changes page</a>.</p>
