<h2>Generic Reporting</h2>
<p>Bugzilla has a mechanism for generating reports of the current state of the
bug database.  It has two related parts: a table-based view, and several
graphical views.</p>

<p>The table-based view allows you to specify an x, y and z (multiple tables of
data) axis to plot, and then restrict the bugs plotted using the standard query
form.  You can view the resulting data as an HTML or CSV export (e.g.: for
importing into a spreadsheet).</p>

<p>There are also bar, line and pie charts, which are defined in a very similar
way.  These views may be more appropriate for particular data types, and are
suitable for saving and then putting into presentations or web pages.</p>

<a name="gc"></a>
<h2>Generic Charting</h2>

<p>Bugzilla has a new mechanism for generating charts (graphs over time) of any
arbitrary search. This is known as "New Charts." Legacy data from the previous
charting mechanism ("Old Charts") is migrated into the "New Charts" when you
upgrade. The Old Charts mechanism remains, but is deprecated and will be 
removed in a future version of Bugzilla.</p>

<p>Individual users can see/create charts as long as they are a member of the 
group specified in the Param 'chartgroup'. Data can be collected for 
personal charts every seven days (or a longer period, as set by the user). 
Charts created by an administrator can be made public (visible to all). Data 
is collected for administrator charts every day (or a longer period, as set 
by the admin).</p>

<p>The data is collected by the collectstats.pl script, which an administrator 
will need to arrange to be run once every day (see the manual). Chart data can
be plotted in a number of different ways, and different data sets can be
plotted on the same graph for comparison.</p>

<a name="rs"></a>
<h2>Request System</h2>
<p>The Request System allows you to flag certain bugs or bug attachments for
review.  Once flagged, the requested reviewer may approve or reject the flagged
bug.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Requests</dt>
<dd>Flags can be made optionally requestable, which means users can ask other
users to set them. When a user requests a flag, Bugzilla emails the requestee
and adds the request to a browsable queue so both the requester and the
requestee can keep track of its status. Once the requestee fulfills the request
by setting the flag to either granted or denied, Bugzilla emails the requestee
and removes the request from the queue.  This feature supports workflow like
the mozilla.org code review and milestone approval processes, whereby code is
peer reviewed before being committed and patches get approved by product
release managers for inclusion in specific product releases.</dd>
<dt>Product/component specificity</dt> 
<dd>Flags are product/component-specific, and a single flag can be enabled or
disabled for multiple product/component combinations via inclusions and
exclusions lists. Flags are enabled for all combinations on their inclusions
list except those that appear on their exclusions list.</dd>
</dl>

<a name="egs"></a>
<h2>Enterprise Group Support</h2>
<p>Administrators can define an arbitrary number of access groups composed of
individual users or other groups.  The groups can be configured via the web
interface to achieve a wide variety of access control policies. See the
documentation section on 'Groups And Group Controls' for details.</p>  

<a name="uwm"></a>
<h2>User Wildcard Matching</h2>
<p>Enable the use of wildcards and substrings in bug entry and editing forms.
If the user enters an incomplete username, Bugzilla will display a list of
users that match the given username.</p>

<a name="sfi"></a>
<h2>Insiders</h2>
<p>If the 'insidergroup' parameter is defined, a specific group of users can be
designated insiders who can designate comments and attachments as private to
other insiders. These comments and attachments will be invisible to other users
who are not members of the insiders group even if the bugs to which they apply
are visible. Other insiders will see the comments and attachments with a visual
tinting indicating that they are private.</p>  

<a name="tt"></a>
<h2>Time Tracking</h2>
<p>Controls for tracking time spent fixing bugs are included in the bug form
for members of the group specified by the 'timetrackinggroup' parameter. Any
time comments are added to the bug, members of the time tracking group can add
an amount of time they spent, and it's figured into the total and displayed at
the top of the bug. Shown in the bug are your original estimate, the amount of
time spent so far, the revised estimate of how much time is remaining, and your
gain/loss on the original estimate.</p>

<a name="auth"></a>
<h2>Multiple Authentication Methods</h2>
<p>Bugzilla's authentication mechanisms are modular, making it very easy to add
custom authentication methods to the system as needed.  Bugzilla has built-in
support for MySQL and LDAP authentication methods, but other methods are easily
attainable with minimal custom development.</p>  
<p>LDAP logins use Perl's standard Net::LDAP module, which has no external
library dependencies.</p>

<a name="ils"></a>
<h2>Improved localization support</h2>
<p>Bugzilla administrators can now configure which languages are supported by
their installations and automatically serve correct, localized content to users
based on the HTTP 'Accept-Language' header sent from users' browsers.</p>
<p>There are currently localized templates available for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Arabic</li>
	<li>Belarusian</li>
	<li>Chinese</li>
	<li>French</li>
	<li>German</li>
	<li>Italian</li>
	<li>Korean</li>
	<li>Portuguese (Brazil)</li>
	<li>Spanish (Spain or Mexico)</li>
	<li>Russian</li>
</ul>
<p>These localized template packs are third-party contributions, may only be
available for specific versions, and may not be supported in the future.

<a name="pv"></a>
<h2>Patch Viewer</h2>
<p>Viewing and reviewing patches in Bugzilla is often difficult due to lack of
context, improper format and the inherent readability issues that raw patches
present. Patch Viewer is an enhancement to Bugzilla designed to fix that by
offering increased context, linking to sections, and integrating with Bonsai,
LXR and CVS.</p>

<a name="crl"></a>
<h2>Comment Reply Links</h2>
<p>In Edit Bug, each bug comment now includes a convenient (reply) link that
quotes the comment text into the textarea. This feature is only enabled in
Javascript-capable browsers, but causes no inconvenience to other user
agents.</p>

<a name="fts"></a>
<h2>Full-Text Search</h2>
<p>It is now possible to query the Bugzilla database using full-text searching,
which spans comments and summaries, and which searches for substrings and stem
variations of the search term. Basically, it's like using Google.  This search
page is now presented to first-time users as the default search, however their
choice of seearch page is remembered in a cookie, so clicking the 'Search' link
will always return to the most-recently visited search page.</p>

<a name="eam"></a>
<h2>Email Address Munging</h2>
<p>The fact that raw email addresses are displayed in Bugzilla makes it trivial
for bots that spamharvest to spider through Bugzilla, in particular, through
Bugzilla's buglists. This change adds HTML obfuscation of email addresses as
they appear in the Bugzilla web pages.</p>

<a name="glbs"></a>
<h2>Google-like Bug Search</h2>

<p>Bugzilla now includes a very simple, Google-like &quot;Find a Specific
Bug&quot; page, in addition to its advanced search page.</p>

<a name="mf"></a>
<h2>Miscellaneous Features</h2>
<ul>
        <li>The "Assigned To" field on the new bug page is now prefilled with
the default component owner.</li>
	<li>A bug alias column is now available in the buglist page.</li>
        <li>Lists of bugs containing errors in the sanity check page now have a
"view as buglist" link in addition to the individual bug links.</li>
        <li>Autolinkification Page - It's now possible to apply Bugzilla's
comment hyperlinking algorithm to any text you like. This should be useful for
status updates and other web pages which give lists of bugs. The bug links
created include the subject, status and resolution of the bug as a
tooltip.</li>  
        <li>There are more &lt;link&gt; tags on the links toolbar for
navigating quickly between different areas.</li>
        <li>Buglists are now available as comma-separated value files (CSV) and
JavaScript (JS) as well as HTML and RDF.</li>
        <li>Keywords and dependencies can now be entered during initial bug
entry</li>
        <li>A CSS id signature unique to each Bugzilla installation is now
added to the &lt;body&gt; tag on Bugzilla pages to allow custom end-user CSS to
explicitly affect Bugzilla.</li>
        <li>Perl's path has been changed to a normal /usr/bin/perl from the
original legacy "bonsaitools" path specifier.</li>
        <li>A new "always-require-login" parameter allows administrators to
require a login before being able to view any page, except the front page.</li>
        <li>A developer may add an attachment, and also reassign a bug to
himself as part of that single action.</li>
        <li>Bugzilla is now able to use the replication facilities provided by
the MySQL database to handle updates from the main database to the
secondaries.</li>
	<li>Mail handling is now between 125% to 175% faster.</li>

    <li>Guided Bug Entry: You can see a sample enter_bug.cgi template at 
        enter_bug.cgi?format=guided that &quot;guides&quot; users through the process of 
        filing a &quot;good&quot; bug. It needs to be modified before use in your organization.</li>

    <li>There is now a "Give me some help" link on the Advanced Search page that will
        enable pop-up help for every field on the page.</li>

    <li>The Bugzilla administrator can now forbid users from marking bugs RESOLVED 
        when there are unresolved dependencies.</li>

</ul>
