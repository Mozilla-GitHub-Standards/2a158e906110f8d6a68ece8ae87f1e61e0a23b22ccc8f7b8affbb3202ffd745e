<h1>2.17.5 Security Advisory</h1>
November 9th, 2003<br/>
<pre>
Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, currently used by a large
number of software projects.

This advisory covers a security bug which was accidently introduced in
development version 2.17.5 and subsequently fixed in the Bugzilla code
involving unprivileged access to restricted data.

All Bugzilla installations who have upgraded to the 2.17.5 development
snapshot are encouraged to obtain version 2.17.6 or apply the relevant
patch.

The current stable version of Bugzilla is 2.16.4, and is not affected
by this advisory.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Information leak
Versions:    2.17.5 is the only version affected.
Description: A new feature was introduced in version 2.17.5 which allows
             remote websites to build tooltips and other dynamically
             generated data using current bug information retrieved from
             Bugzilla.  A security lapse in the initial implementation
             of this feature allows the remote site to obtain that
             information from Bugzilla using the privileges of the
             client user.
