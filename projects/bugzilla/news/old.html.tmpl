<h2>[ 2002 Feb 13 ] Final Countdown to Bugzilla 2.16</h2>

<p>
We've <b><i>finally</i></b> entered our final countdown to the Bugzilla 2.16 release.
Read all about it our latest <a href="[% WEBPATH %]/status/2002-02-13.html">status update</a>.
</p>

<h2>[ 2002 Jan 18 ] New Status Update Available</h2>

<p>
It's been a while since our last status update.  Unfortunately, because it's
been so long, this one is also rather lengthy.  However, it does contain the
most recent information about Bugzilla's development as a whole and the
upcoming 2.16 release in particular. So, to find out what's been happening in
the Bugzilla world, take a gander at this latest <a
href="[% WEBPATH %]/status/2002-01-18.html">status update</a>.
</p>

<h2>[ 2002 Jan 05 ] Bugzilla 2.14.1 Released!</h2>
<p>Bugzilla 2.14.1 is now available for download.  For details of upgrade options
and download locations see the <a href="[% WEBPATH %]/download/">downloads page</a>.</p>
<p>If you already have a version of Bugzilla 2.15 that was checked out of CVS,
please DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION, but use <tt>cvs update</tt> to pull in these
fixes.  Bugzilla 2.14.1 does not contain most of the code currently in CVS, but
is only patches that have been back-ported to the 2.14 code base in order to seal
security holes that were too important to wait until we finish 2.16.  If you have
version 2.15 from CVS and have have updated later than January 3, 2002, you already
have all of these security fixes.</p>
<p>View the <a href="[% WEBPATH %]/releases/2.14.1/release-notes.html">release notes</a> and the
<b><a href="[% WEBPATH %]/security/2.14.1/">security advisory</a></b>.</p>
<p>For changes between 2.14 and 2.14.1, view the <a href="[% WEBPATH %]/status/changes.html">Bugzilla
  changelog</a>.</p>

<h2>[ 2002 Jan 01 ] Bugzilla 2.16 is still in progress</h2>
<p>We've now missed more than one target trying to complete Bugzilla 2.16.  Based on  
our current progress, we've backed our target release date off to February 1st.  We're
deeply sorry to keep everyone waiting, but we'd rather have it done right than rushed,
and several of us have been short on time lately.  If you can assist with any coding 
for the remaining blockers, feel free to submit patches to the bugs in question.  See   
the <a href="[% WEBPATH %]/status/roadmap.html#milestones">Master Plan</a> page for a link to those bugs.</p>

<h2>[ 2001 Nov 19 ] Master Plan updated</h2>
<p>The <a href="[% WEBPATH %]/status/roadmap.html">Master Plan</a> page has finally been updated to reflect reality :)</p>

<h2>[ 2001 Oct 18 ] Website Redesigned</h2>
<p>In an effort to provide better communication about just what's going on, and to
make Bugzilla more accessible, we've redesigned the Bugzilla project pages to try 
to make the information more useful and help people find things.</p>
<p>One of the major new features of the site is the <a href="[% WEBPATH %]/status/">Status
Updates</a> section, which contains a (pretty lengthly) discussion
of everything that's gone into Bugzilla so far since version 2.14 was released.
This will be a regularly updated column with a new update every week or two (so
they won't all be as lengthly as the first one).</p>

<p>Like our new logo in the header above?  I don't, but I'm a crappy artist,
and we have yet to have anything else submitted.  If you have an idea for our
logo, please visit <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100095">bug 100095</a>.</p>

<h2>[ 2001 Aug 29 ] Bugzilla 2.14 Released!</h2>
<p>The Bugzilla team has been hard at work to bring you Bugzilla 2.14 which offeres
  many new improvements, including upgrades to the security group system, the
  death of oldemailtech, and the addition of a &quot;X-Bugzilla-Reason&quot; in
  the headers of bug mail which users can use to filter bug mail into folders
  depending on if they are the assignee, cc, qa contact, etc...</p>

<h2>[ 2001 Jul 18 ] New Bugzilla Project Leader</h2>
<P>Reality has hit hard for <A HREF="mailto:tara&#64;tequilarista.org">Tara Hernandez</A>,
as she was recently promoted to director of her area at
<A HREF="http://www.bluemartini.com/">Blue Martini Software</A>, and has suddenly
found herself with very little time to spare for the Bugzilla project.  Facing
this reality, she was forced to step down as the project leader for Bugzilla and
handed off the reigns to <A HREF="mailto:justdave&#64;bugzilla.org">Dave Miller</A>.
Tara is not leaving the Bugzilla project, and will continue to contribute when
she has time, as well as administering the bugzilla test server at
<A HREF="http://landfill.tequilarista.org/">landfill.tequilarista.org</A>.  An
<A HREF="news://news.mozilla.org/3B562E3F.4080602@tequilarista.org">announcement</A>
was recently posted to
<A HREF="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.webtools">netscape.public.mozilla.webtools</A>.
This is not expected to impact the v2.14 release, which is still slated within the next few weeks.</P>

<h2>[ 2001 Apr 27 ] Bugzilla 2.12 Released!</h2>
<P>At long last, after almost a year of work, <B>Bugzilla 2.12 is finally out!</B>
Many thanks to all the people who contributed to making this one of the
biggest leaps in recent history for Bugzilla development.</P>

<P>View the <A HREF="[% WEBPATH %]/releases/2.12/">release notes</A> and
