Warning: A Slashdot article published on 3/13/03 incorrectly stated that the Mozilla 1.3 final
release is applying machine learning to autocomplete.  Please keep in mind that Mozilla 1.3 does NOT 
contain the data collection or the learning code that we talk about on
this page.  That code only shipped with 1.3 BETA and was taken out in time for the 1.3 final release.
Data collection and learning will only work with the 1.3 BETA builds.
</B>
               
<h2><a name="intro"></a>introduction</h2>
        You have all used the autocomplete feature in the browser, right? 
&nbsp;For    those who haven't, here's a picture:<br>
        <br>
        <img src="autocomplete.jpg" alt="autocomplete screenshot"
 width="706" height="168">
        <br>
        <br>
        I typed "www.m" in the url bar and Mozilla showed me a list of urls 
 that   match. &nbsp;In other words, Mozilla <b>"autocompleted"</b> the url 
 for me.  &nbsp;If the url I want is in the dropdown list, I can select it 
 and avoid  typing out the whole url manually.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, the autocomplete list is often totally useless.&nbsp;
 I  frequently visit Bugzilla, but having typed in "bug", the autocomplete
   list looks like this:<br>
   <br>
   <img src="ac-bad.jpg"
 alt="Autocomplete example that needs improvement" width="895"
 height="173">
   <br>
       <br>
       This is not useful since I don't want to scroll through  pages of
urls  to find the bug I am working on today. &nbsp;Moreover, even if I've
visited  the same bug 20 times today, it still appears way down in the list.<br>
  <b><br>
  A more "intelligent" Mozilla would recognize what you are doing, and act
 to help you.&nbsp; </b>In this project, we will use machine learning to
make  Mozilla more intelligent in sorting urls in the list. &nbsp;Sorting
will happen based on a rank assigned to each url in the list. &nbsp;The goal
will be to rank urls that are likely to be visited highest on the list. &nbsp;That
way, when the urls are sorted by rank, they will show up on the top of the
list and can be selected easily. &nbsp;Mozilla will continously improve its
method of ranking urls as the user selects urls in autocomplete sessions.
&nbsp;While  our first application of url rankings will be to improve the
usability of the autocomplete drop-down   list, we also hope to use similar
methods later on to improve web page prefetching  and caching. &nbsp;More
details on where we want to take this project in the future are described
<a href="#why">here</a>.<b><br>
<br>
To make this project successful, we need your help in collecting data for the first phase of this project
(see step 1 in the <a href="#details">roadmap </a>below). &nbsp;All you
need to do is switch on a preference, browse using the Mozilla 1.3 beta release,
and submit a data file after approximately two weeks. &nbsp;More details
on <a href="#how">how you can help</a> are given below.</b><br>
<h2><a name="details"></a>project roadmap</h2>
      1) Collect data. &nbsp;The more people that participate in collecting 
 data   the better. &nbsp;If you are tech-savvy and can help some non-technical
  people  to run Mozilla, collect data, and submit it, that would also be
a  huge contribution  to this project, since that would help make the data
represent  the browsing behavior of a broader set of users. &nbsp;More details
on the specifics of how to collect data are given <a href="#how">below</a>.<br>
        2) Once we have enough data, we'll use it to design and test different
   learning algorithms for predicting user browsing behavior.<br>
        3) Implement and deploy a prototype of the best learning algorithm.<br>
        4) If the response from the Mozilla community is supportive, replace
  the   current url sorting algorithm with the better algorithm.<br>
               
<h2><a name="how"></a>how can i contribute?</h2>
               
<h4>A) Data Collection</h4>
        It's very easy. &nbsp;We'd like to recruit as many Mozilla users
as  possible   to collect browsing and autocomplete data for this project.
&nbsp;You  will   be in control throughout the data collection process. &nbsp;You
will  be able  to toggle the data capture mode, see the generated data file,
and  decide  whether to submit the data file back to us. &nbsp;We've also
thought  long and hard about privacy issues -- the data collection process
is completely   transparent  and gives you options to safeguard your privacy
at every step.<br>
        <br>
        Here are the detailed steps to participate in data collection:<a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/"><br>
  </a>  
<ol>
    <li>Download a Mozilla   1.3 beta or later build.</li>
    <li>(optional) Email <a href="mailto:nisheeth_mozilla@yahoo.com,ang@cs.stanford.edu">us</a> to 
let us know you're participating. &nbsp;(This is optional, but will be helpful
 to us for keeping track of roughly how many volunteers/users we'll have.)<br>
    </li>

          <li>Type about:config in Mozilla's Location Bar to bring up a list of all your
preferences. Right-click on any of them (Cmd + Click if you're using a Mac) to
bring up the context menu and then select 'Integer' from the 'New' submenu.
Enter the following as the preference name:
<br>
<code>browser.history.url.datacapture.mode</code>
<br>
When asked for the value, enter <code>2</code> or <code>1</code>. Both settings
will dump data into a file called <b>url-data.txt</b> in your profile directory (click
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.0/#profiles">here</a> to find out where the profile 
directory is located on your platform).  The different data capture modes are explained below.
</li>
        <li>Do your daily browsing using this build for approximately two 
weeks.</li>
        <li>Zip up the <b>url-data.txt</b> file in your profile directory 
and  use <a
 href="http://www.mozillazine.org/misc/bug-182366-submit-anon-url-data.html">this
    web page</a> to submit the data file anonymously. &nbsp;In case you have
   any problems zipping up or submitting the data, please <a
 href="mailto:nisheeth_mozilla@yahoo.com,ang@cs.stanford.edu?subject=Data%20Submission%20Problems">email 
 us.</a><br>
  </li>
           
</ol>

<h4>B) Playing with the simple learning algorithm:</h4>
        Along with collecting data, if you want to get a taste of how a learning
    enabled autocomplete might work, use "about:config" (see the 2nd bullet item above 
for more info) to add the following pref to Mozilla: <br>
               
<pre>	user_pref("browser.urlbar.autocomplete.learning.mode", 2);</pre>
        Setting this preference will enable a very simple learning algorithm
  that   will identify urls that you are likely to click on in the autocomplete
  drop   down list. &nbsp;After a few autocomplete sessions, urls identified
  as likely   click-candidates by the learning engine will show up with an
 asterisk prefixed   to the title of the url in the dropdown list. &nbsp;You'll
 get a sense of   what the engine thinks you will select from the autocomplete
  list. &nbsp;This   is an early prototype and is probably buggy, so tread
 cautiously. &nbsp;When   you turn on this preference, a file called <b>ac-weights.txt
  </b>will be  created in your profile directory and written to each time
you  select a url  from the autocomplete list. &nbsp;This file contains the
numeric  weights used by the learning engine to classify urls.<br>
        <br>
        If setting the above preference causes any problems, just set the 
learning    mode to 0 or remove the above line from the prefs.js file. &nbsp;Please
  report  any problems by filing a bug in <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/bugs/">Bugzilla  </a>and assigning it to "nisheeth_mozilla@yahoo.com". 
 &nbsp;If you'd rather <a

 us an email</a> about the problem, please feel free. &nbsp;Thanks!<br>
               
<h2><a name="who"></a>who is working on this?</h2>
         I am doing this work with a Computer Science professor at Stanford,
  <a href="http://www.robotics.stanford.edu/%7Eang/">Andrew Ng.</a> &nbsp;He
  taught Stanford's <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs221/">Artificial
  Intelligence course</a> last year and is teaching the <a
 href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/">Machine Learning course</a>
this year.<br>
         <br>
         If you want to volunteer your time in any way on this project, please
   <a
 href="mailto:nisheeth_mozilla@yahoo.com,ang@cs.stanford.edu?subject=Autocomplete%20Learning%20Project">email
   us</a>. &nbsp;We'd love to work with you.<br>
               
<h2><a name="why"></a>i can think of other places in mozilla that can use
   machine learning. &nbsp;why don't you work on those problems as well?</h2>
      Yes! &nbsp;We are very excited about applying machine learning and
 artificial  intelligence ideas to make Mozilla a more "intelligent" browser. 
&nbsp;We're   currently considering a few other projects, but if you have 
ideas or suggestions,   please feel free to <a
 href="mailto:nisheeth_mozilla@yahoo.com,ang@cs.stanford.edu">email us</a>. &nbsp;Your 
 input is more than welcome!<br>
      <br>
      We started working on autocomplete as a first, concrete step towards
 applying machine learning to Mozilla because we think that the work we do
 here can be broadly applied. &nbsp;First, we anticipate that  autocomplete
 usability  improvements will be multiplied as they are applied in different
  contexts  like email, instant messaging, etc. &nbsp;Second, we also hope
 to apply these ideas to improve prefetching and caching. &nbsp;Specifically,
 similar techniques should be applicable for ranking urls within a web page.
 &nbsp;We can then try to use those rankings to intelligently  pre-fetch
the  urls that the user is most likely to click next while the user  is reading
 the current page. &nbsp;We can also use the rankings to improve the cache
 eviction policy so that pages least likely to be viewed are removed from
the cache first. &nbsp;Better prefetching and caching can lead to a huge
performance win on slow, dialup connections and on fast, broadband connections
(when the server is slow in sending data).<br>
