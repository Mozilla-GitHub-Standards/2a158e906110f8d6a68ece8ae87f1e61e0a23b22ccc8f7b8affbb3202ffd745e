All files in this directory, with the exception of README, apidoc.xml, 
*.css, and *-frameset.html were generated by APIDOC,
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/apidoc.  To modify thiese files, adjust
apidoc.xml and regenerate the html with the parse_apidoc.pl script.

If your change adds or removes files, MAKE SURE TO UPDATE THE NOWRAP FILE!!!
The easiest way (under unix or cygwin) is to 
`ls -1 --color=never *.html > NOWRAP`
