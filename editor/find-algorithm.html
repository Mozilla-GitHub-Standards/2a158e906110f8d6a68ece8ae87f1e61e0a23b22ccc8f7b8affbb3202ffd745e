<h1>Care and Feeding of Find in Page</h1>
 
<h2>Basics</h2>
 
<p>The find algorithm is located in 
<a
href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/embedding/components/find/src/nsFind.cpp">nsFind.cpp</a>, 
and the core of it is in 
<a
href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/embedding/components/find/src/nsFind.cpp#548">nsFind::Find</a>.&nbsp; 
I'm going to assume that these clusters are entirely located within 
one text node, so you shouldn't need to work about routines like 
NextNode or SkipNode -- those should just work.</p>

<p>Find() searches forward or backward through the tree, looking 
at nodes (almost always a text node, though there's an RFE to be able 
to search in other types  of nodes) and comparing character by 
character with our pattern string. In reverse, we compare characters 
starting from the end of the pattern string, not the beginning 
(that might be important for this bug).</p>

<p>When we start a match (i.e. match one or more characters), we save 
the point where the match started then continue through the string. 
If we reach the end of the pattern string and we're still matching, we 
have succeeded; if we hit a non-match before the end of the pattern 
string, then we have to go back to the next character in the tree after 
the place where this match  started, and reset our position in the 
pattern string to the beginning (or end, if backwards).</p>
 
<h2>Important variables within nsFind::Find()</h2>
 
<p><code>mIterNode</code> is the current node we're examining. It is updated 
by <a 
href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/embedding/components/find/src/nsFind.cpp#264">NextNode</a>, 
which uses a content iterator to move forward or backward in the tree. It 
needs to be able to discard nodes which are children of skipped nodes; if 
we had an iterator which visited nodes both before and after iterating 
through their children (so we would see the parent before the children 
in both forward and backward directions), but the current content 
iterator doesn't support that (in fact, its Post order iteration is 
unreliable and not supported). So the current code climbs the tree to 
find the first block parent, and compares that to the last block parent 
it saw to determine when block boundaries are crossed. I originally 
tried to use a <a
href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/dom/public/idl/traversal/nsIDOMTreeWalker.idl">nsIDOMTreeWalker
 </a>, which might have made this easier, but didn't get it to work; 
this might be an improvement at some point.</p>

<p><code>mIterOffset</code> is the current offset into the node: the 
place at which the current match started, or, if we're not in a 
partial match, the character we're comparing right now.</p>

<p><code>pindex</code> is the current offset into the pattern string, 
and <code>findex</code> is the current offset into the current node 
(so these two point to the characters we're currently comparing).</p>

<p>You may have noticed that <code>findex</code> and 
<code>mIterOffset</code> seem to do the same thing. They basically do, 
but findex points to a character, whereas mIterOffset is a range 
offset that points between characters: see the note around line 680.</p>

<p>Since a match may (and often does) span multiple nodes in the tree, <code>matchAnchorNode</code>
 and <code>matchAnchorOffset</code> store the node and offset (range 
offset) where the current partial match began, while <code>mIterNode</code> 
and <code>mIterOffset</code> advance.</p>
 
<h2>Debugging tips</h2>
 
<p>You can #define DEBUG_find 1 and get lots of spew on standard output 
about what the algorithm is doing; I initially put these in because gdb 
doesn't always work reliably, but it's also useful in cases where you 
have to search a lot of text before the first match, so stopping/continuing 
past a breakpoint would take a long time.</p>

<p>Fragments of text nodes in the dom can be either single or double byte: 
see the use of the pointers t1b and t2b.</p>

<p>Given this info, the comments in the code may be enough to take 
you through the algorithm. Most of it is fairly straightforward; some of 
the tricky logic has to do with matching whitespace (any space in the 
pattern string matches one or more spaces in the document, so for example 
a double space in the pattern string must match two or more characters 
of whitespace -- which includes space, dom newline (\n), and non-breaking 
space (&amp;nbsp;). There's also some tricky logic regarding when to 
advance findex and pindex.</p>
 
<p>There is a set of regression tests for find, located <a
 href="../quality/browser/front-end/testcases/xpapps-gui/find-on-page/find-in-page.html">here</a>.
 Please run through the entire set of tests after modifying find, and 
if possible, add a new test which will detect regressions in the bug 
you are fixing. Although these find tests are not an official part 
of the QA acceptance tests, running them regularly will make it much 
easier to detect regressions.</p>
 
<h2>Hints on likely places that might need work</h2>
 
<p>If you're reading this, it's probably because you have a bug that 
needs fixing. Here are some areas known to need work, and where 
to look:</p>
 
<ul>
   <li>Support for languages which use more than one doublewide character 
per group. The usage of t1b and t2b might be all that need be modified 
for this. Perhaps we need a tMultiByte option everywhere we now deal 
with t1b and t2b. You'll need to be able to iterate forward and backward 
in the string from the position of tMultiByte. If that's not 
straightforward, then you might have to define iterators which do what 
we currently do now in the single and double byte case, but do more work 
to implement forward and backward iteration in the multibyte case. 
Perhaps you could make a small class with an interator operator on it, 
which encapsulates the one- vs-two- vs-multiple byte string. If you're 
feeling ambitious, you could make a derivative of our string classes 
which handles text fragments of varying length; this would be useful 
in other areas as well, but writing it in a way that doesn't slow down 
find performance (no string copies!) might be challenging.</li>
   <li>Off-by-one problems: be careful of when <code>findex</code> 
and <code>pindex</code> are incremented, and to where they are 
reset. It's easy to get off by one here when you're adding new 
code, and it's certainly possible that there are off-by-one bugs 
still lurking in the present code. If you have to change the 
way <code>findex</code> and <code>pindex</code> are incremented 
or reset, be sure to comment what you're doing (it's way too easy to 
get lost in this code without comments) and run through
the regression tests completely.</li>
   <li>Wildcard searching (bug <a
 href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32641">32641</a>) and whole
word only (bug <a
 href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14871">14871</a>): unfortunately, 
we won't be able to leverage anything already written for our nsAString classes, 
because of the one- vs two- byte problem, the fact that we can't copy for 
performance reasons, and the need to match both forward and backward. I 
think the best way to inplement wildcard searching is to do something like 
what we already do for whitespace: use a flag to keep track of whether we're 
in a match, and increment findex but not pindex as long as the wildcard continues 
to match. This sounds not too hard, but I expect it will take some debugging
to get it right. Perhaps wildcards and spaces can be combined into
a more general concept.</li>
   <li>Extending find to look through nodes other than text nodes (bug <a
 href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=158757">158757</a>). This 
will require changes (probably fairly straightforward) in two places: one 
in <a
 href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/embedding/components/find/src/nsFind.cpp#264">NextNode()</a>, 
with perhaps also a little work in <a
 href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/embedding/components/find/src/nsFind.cpp#456">SkipNode</a>; 
and a change in the <a
 href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/embedding/components/find/src/nsFind.cpp#697">code 
segment</a> where we get the text out of the text node, which currently assumes 
a text node.</li>
