    <h3>Description:</h3>


    <ol>
        <li>The "User Action" is what happens when mouse goes down when the
        cursor looks like the icon shown. Sizing and dragging involve moving
        the cursor with the mouse down, of course. There are two general "User
        Rules":

            <ol>
                <li><em>Watch your cursor!</em> As you mouse over the table,
                the cursor tells you what action is possible. There should be a
                status message in the usual area at the window bottom to help
                the user understand what action is possible. (These are XP
                strings and should be used by all FEs). <span class="remark">Kathy:
                can the Mac do this?</span></li>


                <li><em>Press the modifier key</em> and watch the cursor and
                status line. If the cursor changes, a different action is
                possible and the status information should communicate
                that.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>


        <li>
            <a name="Selecting" id="Selecting">Selecting a single object</a> is
            just a single click. Other selection behavior:

            <ul>
                <li>A selected table should show a single highlighted border
                around the entire table:<br>
                <img src="EdSelectTable.gif" alt="EdSelectTable.gif" height=
                "76" width="155"><br>
                Selected cells should show highlighting around each cell
                individually.</li>


                <li>For the purpose of selection (as well as in the Cell
                property dialog), a "column" is all cells sharing the same left
                border (X value), and a row is all cells sharing the same top
                border (Y value.) Thus cells with COLSPAN &gt; 1 or rowspan
                &gt;1 will be not be included in the spanned column or row
                (i.e., they are only members of one row or column - the one
                matching their top or left edge respectively.)<br>
                <img src="EdSelectedRow1.gif" alt="EdSelectedRow1" height=
                "106" width="222"> 1st row <img src="EdSelectRow2.gif" alt=
                "EdSelectRow2" height="102" width="222">2nd row</li>


                <li>Multiple cells can be selected by holding the "Modifier
                key" (Ctrl in Windows an UNIX, Cmd on the Mac) and clicking on
                non-contiguous cells. A cell already selected will be
                unselected if the modifier is down when user clicks.
                Non-contiguous rows or columns can also be selected by holding
                down the Modifier key when clicking on a second row or column
                hit region after the initial selection. (You cannot unselect a
                row or column in this way, however.)</li>


                <li>Another way to select multiple cells is to place the caret
                in a cell, then drag into a neighboring cell -- as soon as the
                cursor leaves the first cell, any text selected is unselected,
                and we go into "cell selection mode." As the mouse is dragged
                with the mouse button is still down, a set of cells can be
                selected or unselected starting with the initial cell as the
                upper left corner, and the cell under the cursor as the
                lower-right cell in the rectangle.</li>


                <li>Multiple columns or rows can also be selected by clicking
                on the appropriate area to select the initial row or column,
                then dragging: left/right for more columns, or up/down for more
                rows.</li>


                <li>Whenever one or more cells or the table are selected, there
                is also the blinking caret. Selecting a table or one or more
                cells will move the caret into the table, usually in the
                top-left cell of the selection. When the user starts typing,
                the table or cell selection should disappear and the characters
                are input at the caret location. There should <em>never</em> be
                the usual selection style for text or other objects visible at
                the same time as selected cells or tables. There may be more
                than one cell selected in a table, of course, but never in
                different tables within the same page.</li>


                <li>Whenever the user clicks the mouse and is not on a cell or
                table selection hit area, the caret should be moved (or
                non-table object selected) and cell or table selection should
                be removed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>


        <li>
            <a name="MouseHitRegions" id="MouseHitRegions">The "Mouse Hit
            Regions"</a> depend on the intercell spacing, border thickness, and
            intracell padding values.

            <ul>
                <li>In general, the sizing selection regions try to use as much
                of the intracell ("Cell padding") and intercell space ("Cell
                spacing") to avoid conflicting with the user's attempt to place
                a caret in the text within a cell.</li>


                <li>When there is intercell spacing, that region is available
                for sizing a row or columns, so there is less area within the
                cell that is used.</li>


                <li>The user should be able to place the caret in any of the
                four corners of a cell, and along the entire left border (just
                to the right of the border). These corners are excluded from
                the table-hit regions to facilitate caret placement.</li>


                <li>The most difficult condition to select and size cells is
                when the table border, cell spacing, and cell padding values
                are all zero. This is used when the purpose of the table is to
                layout regions of the page akin to a "desktop publishing"
                program. We advise users to keep some Spacing and Padding while
                editing and data entry, then convert to the zero values when
                finished.</li>


                <li>When a cell has no border, Composer shows the cell boundary
                with a single-pixel dashed line. This is controlled by the
                "Table Border" setting in the Table Properties dialog. When the
                table has a border width &gt; 0, the cell has a 1-pixel visible
                border. The exception is an empty cell, which will not display
                its borders at all (as well as not displaying the background
                color or image.) In that case, the dashed line should be
                displayed to indicate this condition to the user. (A single
                space will cause the border to display - see next topic.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>


        <li>
            <a name="AutomaticFill" id="AutomaticFill">Automatic filling</a> in
            of new empty cells with spaces

            <ul>
                <li>There is a hidden preference (editor.new_cell_has_space),
                whose default value is YES. A single space is placed in any
                cell created in Composer, such as when new tables, rows,
                columns, or cells are inserted by the user, or automatically
                when padding rows or columns after pasting cells (to keep the
                table geometry regular.). This allows the border, background
                color, and background image to display in the Browser.</li>


                <li>Cells that are pasted into the page, or when the page is
                initially loaded, are not affected - completely empty cells
                will not have the space automatically inserted.</li>


                <li>A user can remove this space by using the delete key.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>


        <li>
            <a name="WhatToDoWithSelectedCells" id=
            "WhatToDoWithSelectedCells">What to do with selected cells</a> or
            table

            <ul>
                <li>Once a set of cells is selected, any character or paragraph
                formating action will apply to the contents of each selected
                cell.</li>


                <li>The background color of a selected table or any set of
                selected cells can be quickly changed by holding down the Alt
                key and clicking on the color widget on the toolbar. (The
                tooltip and status line help describe the availability of this
                otherwise hidden feature.)<br>
                This is currently implemented only on Windows 
                <span class="remark">Do we plan to support it on Mac and UNIX?</span></li>


                <li>In the case of a selected table, all formating actions are
                the same as if all cells in the table are selected except for
                alignment. If alignment is changed using the toolbar drop-down
                button bar, or from the Format | Align menu, this will change
                the horizontal alignment of the table relative to the Composer
                window. To set the alignment of the contents in all cells,
                select all cells in the table first.</li>


                <li>The delete key will delete the contents of all selected
                cells. If all the cells in a row or column are deleted, the row
                or column boundaries will also be deleted. This is done to not
                upset the geometry of the table when only a partial row or
                column is deleted. If the table is deleted, the entire table
                should be completed deleted</li>


                <li>The usual copy and cut commands are also available. The
                same rules for the delete key apply for deleting contents-only
                or entire rows, columns, or the table.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>


        <li>
            <a name="SizingBehavior" id="SizingBehavior">Sizing behavior</a>

            <ul>
                <li>When a sizing icon is visible, click and drag to resize a
                column, row, or the table. The item to be sized does
                <em>not</em> have to be selected first, although that should
                not interfere with the ability to size.</li>


                <li>As the cursor is dragged, information about the changing in
                size should be displayed in the status area. For example:
                "Width = 43 pixels, 53% of previous width."</li>


                <li>Sizing a column or row will set the width (for columns) or
                height (for rows) of all cells in that column or row. For the
                purpose of sizing, the "column" is all cells sharing the same
                right border location (X value) and a "row" is all cells
                sharing the same bottom border location (Y value.) Note that
                this is different from the concept of a column or cell for the
                purpose of selection.</li>


                <li>When a column or row is sized, this changes the dimensions
                for all cells involved, and the parent table, to Pixel mode.
                This is the only way to control the sizing, that is, to have
                the size as close as possible to where the user lifts the mouse
                button when done, because of the limitations of how table
                layout works in HTML 3.2.</li>


                <li>In previous versions, the only direct sizing that was
                possible was sizing the entire table's width. In Gromit, this
                is deliberately less discoverable (the Modifier Key must be
                pressed) because of the difficulty to do table sizing under
                HTML 3.2, and to reduce accidental confusion between sizing the
                table or sizing the last row or column in the table. When
                sizing the table width or height, all cells are temporarily
                converted to "Percent mode", then converted back to the
                previous mode after sizing and relayout is finished. If we
                didn't do this, the table would most likely not resize
                correctly, especially when reducing the width or height, if any
                of the cells already had width or height already set, and it
                would cause much more distortion in the column widths or row
                heights. This is another good reason to make direct table
                sizing a rare thing -- sizing individual columns and rows
                should be preferred by most users.</li>


                <li>Adding more rows or columns by dragging the bottom left or
                right corners is related to sizing the table. Visual feedback
                should be given to show the number of rows or columns being
                added, as well as numeric information on the status line, e.g.:
                "Add 2 row(s) to the table"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>


        <li>
            <a name="PastingAndTables" id="PastingAndTables">Pasting and
            Tables</a>

            <ul>
                <li>Text and other HTML objects can be pasted into a table just
                as before. If any cells or table are selected, non-table data
                on the clipboard should not replace the selected cells'
                contents, but it will insert the clipboard data at the location
                of the blinking caret.</li>


                <li>When cells are copied to the clipboard, they are formated
                into a table. Thus any set of cells that are cut or copied and
                then pasted into a page at a location <em>not</em> inside an
                existing table will insert a new table at the insert caret
                location. If text or HTML objects are selected, they will be
                deleted and replaced by the pasted table.</li>


                <li>The table clipboard data also records the type of source
                data was: a full table, row(s), column(s) or arbitrary selected
                cells. Default behavior when pasting table data into an
                existing table are designed to avoid asking the user how they
                want to format the paste:

                    <ul>
                        <li>If the caret is in a cell, but no cells are
                        selected, the cells will be inserted as a row above the
                        current row if the source type is row, or as a column
                        before the current column if the source type is any
                        other type.</li>


                        <li>If cells in a table are selected, the source data
                        will be "poured" into the table replacing the selected
                        cells in a "left to right" first fashion until all
                        selected cells are replaced or there is no more source
                        cells. Selected cells not replaced will not have their
                        contents deleted. If there are more source cells than
                        selected cells, a message box should appear telling the
                        user "Not all cells in source were pasted".</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>


                <li>More precise pasting is available using the menus: When
                table data is available on the clipboard and the caret is in a
                table or cells are selected, the Table menu and the
                Context/Popup menu contains a submenu: "Paste into Table." (It
                is greyed out in the Table menu if not appropriate.) It has the
                following items:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Nested Table</li>


                        <li>Above current Row</li>


                        <li>Below current Row</li>


                        <li>Before current Column</li>


                        <li>After current Column</li>


                        <li>"Replace" if no cells are selected, or "Replace
                        Selected Cells" if cells are selected.

                            <ul>
                                <li>"Replace Selected Cells" acts like the
                                default action described above.</li>


                                <li>"Replace" replaces cells starting with the
                                cell with the caret, and replacing cells
                                according to the geometry (pattern of cells and
                                rows) of the source data.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>


        <li>Drag and Drop behavior <span class="remark">Windows only?</span>

            <ul>
                <li>When table cells are dragged, the cell data ends up on the
                clipboard just like copying does. Dropping the data is the
                similar to pasting. During the drag process, a cursor icon
                should show the user what is being dragged: <img src=
                "eddrtbm.gif" alt="eddrtbm.gif" height="32" width="32">This is
                the same as earlier versions, including the addition of a "+"
                to the icon when the drop will end up copying the source (In
                Windows: when dragging into a different Composer window, or
                when the Ctrl key is pressed when dropping within the same
                window.)</li>


                <li>Since we are in a special mode when dragging, we can give
                the user more flexibility about how to paste the data -- more
                like that in the "Paste into Table" submenu discussed above.

                    <ul>
                        <li>When the source type is a selected table, or when
                        dragging selected cells over text, the "Drop caret" is
                        used to indicate where a complete new table will be
                        inserted: <img src="eddragcursor.gif" alt=
                        "eddragcursor" height="26" width="3"><br>
                        Thus a complete table can be dropped as a nested table
                        in another table using this technique.<br>
                        The location of the Drop Caret "snaps" to the available
                        insert point and is not necessarily directly beneath
                        the Drag Cursor location.<br>
                        The rest applies only to dragging cells, not a selected
                        table:</li>


                        <li>When the mouse is moved over a cell (cursor hotspot
                        is over central area of a cell), a pattern of cells is
                        highlighted by the "special selection" style --
                        typically a dashed or dotted highlight:<br>
                        <img src="EdPasteReplace.gif" alt="EdPasteReplace"
                        height="112" width="224">Cells 1 and 2 are being
                        dragged over Cell 7. Cells 7 and 8 will be replaced
                        when mouse button goes up.</li>


                        <li>When the mouse moves between cells (or near the
                        neighboring borders if Cell Spacing is 0), a blinking
                        caret shows that cells will be inserted as a new row or
                        column:<br>
                        <img src="EdPasteInsertRow.gif" alt=
                        "EdPasteInsertRow.gif" height="103" width="220">The
                        solid line between Cells 5, 6 and 8, 9 is the location
                        of the blinking caret. Note that the start of the
                        inserted cells will be above Cell 8 because the cursor
                        is over that cell. The length of the caret should
                        indicate the number of cells to be inserted, although
                        the new row to be inserted will be padded with extra
                        empty cell(s) as needed to keep table pattern
                        regular.<br>
                        Here is the result of the paste:<br>
                        <img src="EdPasteRowResult.gif" alt=
                        "EdPasteRowResult.gif" height="133" width="224">Note
                        that Cells 1 and 2 were moved. If the modifier key was
                        pressed, they would have been copied instead.</li>


                        <li>When the source type is Row, inserting between
                        columns is not allowed, and when the source type is
                        Column, inserting between rows is not allowed. For the
                        "selected cells" type, either is allowed. Only the
                        appropriately-oriented blinking caret is displayed
                        while dragging.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>


                <li>When the dropped cells are pasted, all of the source cells
                are usually pasted. If the number of cells in the source rows
                or columns are greater than the available space in the
                destination table, new rows and columns will be created to
                accomodate the pasted cells and keep the pattern regular. The
                only exception to this is when copying between windows and the
                destination table has some selected cells. If the mouse cursor
                is dragged over any of the selected cells, those cells define
                the target cells to be replaced. Thus all the source cells may
                not be pasted if the number of selected cells is less than the
                number in the source table. A popup message informs the user
                when not all of the cells are pasted.</li>


                <li>To greatly simplify how cells are replaced, the COLSPAN and
                rowspan values of the source cells are ignored and the values
                in the cells to be replaced are retained. When inserting new
                columns or rows, the source COLSPAN and rowspan are retained.
                This greatly minimizes the disruption of the layout of the
                destination table while allowing the flexibility of different
                ways to paste without having to ask the user for extra
                information.</li>
