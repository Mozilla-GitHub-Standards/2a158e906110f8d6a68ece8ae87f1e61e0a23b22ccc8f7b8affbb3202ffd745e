<h1>Key Events in SeaMonkey</h1>

<h2> 1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
This document is a specification for all aspects of key events in SeaMonkey
applications.  It describes key event generation, propogation, and
processing.  It is particularly important for platform developers
to understand the key event generation section.
</p>

<h2> 2. Key Event Generation</h2>
<p>
Native input methods (used when typing Japanese), aka IME, must have first
crack at all keyboard events this includes accelerators and keybindings
because they might be used by the native input method (such as to turn
them on and off).  While the IME is active, key events (keydown, keypress,
keyup) will not be generated.  IME input generates text events which
are handled by a separate set of handlers.  If a key event isn't consumed
by the native input method, it will result in a sequence as described below.
</p>
<p>
Each keyboard input results in 3 separate key events:  KeyDown,
followed by KeyPress, followed KeyUp.  All platforms must generate
these events in this sequence for every keyboard input (except IME events).
</p>
<p>
Key repeat (automatic generation of keyevents when a key is held down)
results in a sequence of a KeyDown event, followed by multiple keypress
events, terminated by a KeyUp event.  A keypress event should be generated
for each platform key repeat event recieved.
</p>
<p>
Each key event has 2 data fields:  a virtual key code and a computed
character code.  The key code corresponds to the physical key that
was typed.  The char code represents the Unicode character that results
from the keyboard input.  The char code field is never set during
KeyDown or KeyUp events.  It is only set during a KeyPress event in
which the key maps to an actual character.  The following table describes
how these data are interpreted for each type of key event:
</p>

<table class="data">
<tr>
<th>Key Event</th>
<th>key code</th>
<th>char code</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>KeyDown</td>

<td>set</td>

<td>0 (ignored)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>KeyPress</td>

<td>if char code is set, key code is not set
 so key code is only set for input that doesn't map to a character,
like "home" key or for dead key actions</td>

<td>set if the key typed represents a character determined by nsIsPrintable(), 
 otherwise 0 (ignored)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>KeyUp</td>

<td>set</td>

<td>0 (ignored)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Key listeners are responsible for knowing when to use key codes and
when to use char codes.  In particular, the platform must not try
to map these data in any way other than as specified in the table above.
</p>
<p>
There are a few special cases that need to be described:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	If an alphanumeric key (a - z or 0-9) is pressed,
	a charcode value must be returned, even if a modifier bit is set.
	If the charcode is a resulting
	character which should be inserted in an editor,
	all 4 modifier flags should be cleared (0).  If the charcode
	is not a character but instead a command or keybinding,
	all modifier flags should be left intact. 
	</li>

	<li>
	Modifier keys (such
	as shift, alt, control, command) pressed in isolation generate the
	same event sequence as normal keys.  This is for completeness, so
	an app can choose to do something special when any of these keys are pressed
	in isolation.</li>

	<li>
	Dead keys (such as keyboard
	input used to generate accented characters) generate the same event sequence
	as normal keys. <b>Key events have a bit that says whether the keyboard
	input was from a dead key action</b>. The char code for a dead key
	is always 0 (ignored).</li>

	<li>
	The absolute order of key events generated by a combination of keys is
	indeterminate.  For example, if shift and A are pressed, the keyup
	events could come in either order.</li>

	<li>
	There won't be a distinction between right and left modifier keys (nor
	distinction between keyboard and keypad keys).</li>

	<li>
	Platform special keys (Windows key, contextual menu key on Windows, Macintosh
	startup key, monitor control keys, etc.) do not propagate events. 
	They should be handled in platform code if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2> 3. Key Event Propogation</h2>
<p>
Key events are DOM events, and follow all the normal DOM event rules for
propogation.  See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM-Level-2/events.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM-Level-2/events.html</a>. 
Key event propogation is entirely XP.
</p>

<h2>4. Key Event Processing</h2>

<p>
from Tom Pixley (joki@netscape.com)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Internally we're using the consumeNoDefault flag.  Now
ignore that for a second.  From the DOM perspective, there are three
things that can be done to an event during processing.  One is cancelling
the default action.  This is the equivalent of setting the consume
flag.  This does *not* prevent further processing.  It simply
prevents the default action of the system.  Now in most cases the
system would be the browser itself but since much of the browser is implemented
inside the content area this is a little confusing as the system is really
now Gecko, not the browser, and since Gecko doesn't generally do too much
with the event themselves, cancelling the default action won't buy you
much.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Then there are two other methods, preventCapture and preventBubble. 
These methods will, respectively, prevent further handling by lower Nodes
in the tree after capturing and prevent further handling by higher Nodes
in the tree during bubbling.  If you wish a lower or higher level
Node to get an event and then stop the event from going further you need
to use these flags.  The consumeNoDefault flag will only tell the
system to stop processing the event but it will still go give the event
to all the other DOM handlers. Note that one of the properties of DOM event
processing is that an event processor cannot prevent propogation of the
event to other listeners on that same node.  Since DOM does not provide
for ordering of event delivery to listeners on a single node, there is
no general mechanism to allow for any communication between them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Key listeners are responsible for knowing when to look at key codes and
when to look at char codes.
</p>
<p>
 Key listeners should handle keyboard input using the KeyPress event
handler.
</p>
<p>
 For the editor KeyPress handler, any charCode that is non-zero should
be a valid unicode character which can be inserted.  Keybindings and
accelerators should cancel the event if it shouldn't be inserted in the
editor.  The keybinding component needs to look at key events prior
to the editor component.
</p>
<p>
 Character mapping occurs in the platform specific code, prior to the
keypress event being generated.  When a key combination, such alt+'s'
could be both a keybinding and a character, the platform code will translate
it into the appropriate Unicode character for the keypress event. 
Keybindings need to match against the generated Unicode character in the
keypress event.  The only exception to this is keys like Home or Page
Up which don't have a Unicode character representation.  For this
case, keybindings should use the keycode in the keypress event.
</p>
