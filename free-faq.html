<li><a name="1">What did Netscape announce on January 22, 1998?</a>
<p>Netscape announced that its Netscape Navigator browser and Netscape
Communicator Standard Edition software will now be free to all users, and
Netscape Communicator Professional Edition will be offered for $29 instead of
$79.</p>

<li><a name="2">Why is Netscape making its client products free?</a>

<p>By making its market-leading client products free, Netscape is making the
most popular Internet software applications in the world - the Navigator
browser and Communicator Standard Edition software - even more accessible to
users. This offers users true choice in Internet client software. Netscape
now gains new opportunities to partner with ISPs, OEMs, and other
distribution partners to broadly distribute Navigator and Communicator to
millions of new users.</p>

<li><a name="3">Are all client products free?</a>

<p>Navigator and Communicator Standard Edition are free to all users on all 
<a href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/communicator/datasheet.html#table"> 
supported platforms</a>. Communicator Professional Edition will continue 
to offer premium enterprise features for US$29.</p>

<li><a name="4">When will the free client software be available? How can 
	I get it?</a>

<p>You can get the software today by going to the 
<a class="ex-ref" href="http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/" style="font-weight: bold;">Netscape 8 download

<li><a name="5">Can I get a CD version of the free client 
	products?</a>

handling to any customer requesting it. 
<a href="http://home.netscape.com/subscriber/">Subscriber
Advantage</a> members are entitled to one free CD on payment of a shipping

<li><a name="6">What technical support, if any, is included with the free 
	client products?</a>

	forward?</a>

<p>Netscape continues to offer retail products designed for consumers and small-
and home-office users, including Internet Access Edition, Deluxe Edition, and

Edition by offering valuable third-party applications and plug-ins, dial-up
connectivity, technical support, media, and documentation. Customers can

	subscription programs?</a>

<li><a name="13">Will Netscape make Netscape Communicator 5.0 source code
	freely available?</a>

<p>Netscape has announced that Communicator Standard Edition 5.0 source code

believes that harnessing the creative abilities of all Internet developers
will be an unprecedented way to advance the features and quality of
Communicator for all customers. Detailed

information, and a developer version of Communicator Standard Edition 5.0
