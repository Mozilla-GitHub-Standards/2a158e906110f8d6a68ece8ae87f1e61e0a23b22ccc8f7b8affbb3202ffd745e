<H1>Broadcasters And Observers</H1>

<P><I>Draft 0<BR>
Last modified on 2/16/99 by Mike Pinkerton</I></P>

<P><I>This is a concatenation of some relevant emails and newsgroup
postings about command parameter. Hyatt and Rod are behind most of
this, blame them :-).</I></P>

<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>Much of the XPToolkit is based on the observer concept. A widget's
implementation observes its content model representation, the AOM
node, for changes. The AOM node in turn observes a Command node, just
another AOM node, to see if the command that the widget surfaces in
the UI is enabled. The command node observes some property of an
AppCore/Service to determine its enabled state. All of the above
interactions have been discussed, hinted at, worked around, or
otherwise assumed in previous XPToolkit papers and brownbag
discussions. Obviously the observer concept is fundamental to
XPToolkit, but it has so far been hidden inside of discussions about
the command architecture.</P>

<P>Earlier proposals from the XPToolkit team encouraged the use of
<I>Command</I> nodes to separate user interface elements from the
application code which implemented behaviors. Unfortunately, command
nodes became the dumping ground for just about every bit of
functionality and glue related to tying together application core
objects and UI elements, and as a result, became a big complicated
mess.</P>

<P>Our new proposal introduces <I>Broadcaster</I> and <I>Observer</I>
nodes in the AOM. These new nodes retain the original goal of Command
nodes (that is, allowing multiple reusable UI elements to observe
changes in app core state) but aren't as muddled down with extra
baggage as Command nodes are. In fact, given a combination of event
handlers on UI elements and Broadcaster/Observer nodes, and appCore
reflection into JavaScript, Command nodes are no longer
necessary.</P>

<H2>Replacing Command Nodes</H2>

<P>The observer XUL construct is intended as a mechanism for
communication between AOM nodes. It simply allows the AOM node
observer relationships to be specified in XUL so that they can be
automatically set up at XUL load time.</P>

<H4>Example</H4>

<PRE>&lt;window&gt;

...

&lt;broadcasterset&gt;
   &lt;broadcaster id="cantSendMail"/&gt;
   &lt;broadcaster id="BrowserCore_LoadProgress" percentage=0 /&gt;
&lt;/broadcasterset&gt;

....

&lt;titledbutton id="sendMailButton" 
      onclick="mailCore.sendMessage(document.forms&#91;0&#93;, document.forms&#91;1&#93;, document.forms&#91;2&#93;)"&gt;
   &lt;observes element="cantSendMail" attribute="disabled"&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;titledbutton id="someOtherButton" 
      onclick="mailCore.sendMessage(document.forms&#91;3&#93;, document.forms&#91;4&#93;, document.forms&#91;5&#93;"&gt;
    &lt;observes element="cantSendMail" attribute="disabled"&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;progressmeter&gt;
   &lt;observes element="BrowserCore_LoadProgress" attribute="percentage" /&gt;
&lt;/progressmeter&gt;

...

&lt;/window&gt;</PRE>

<P>In the above example, different form elements are passed in
depending on which button you click. This is really how you'd like it
to work. The AppCore has <I>no</I> knowledge of the UI; it simply
gets some parameters and knows what to do. Any direct UI manipulation
happens at the event-handling level.</P>

<P>In other words, you don't <I>have</I> to use Command nodes. We
also have this notion of broadcaster nodes (with a command being a
specific type of broadcaster). Assuming that the appCore is exposed
somehow as a JS object with its methods reflected into JavaScript,
and that it knows the IDs of the broadcaster or Command nodes it
wants to poke on to do enabling/disabling, you could do the right
thing by making the command invocation (in this case a sendMessage
call) happen at the widget level, and then passing in the elements
that are appropriate based on which widget you're dealing with.</P>

<P>I'm sure many of you are thinking, "Why is all the logic
enabled/disabled logic seemingly backwards?" Recall that the DOM
attribute for enabled/disabled state of an HTML4 &lt;button&gt; tag
is "disabled," and as a result, the properties must be phrased in
those terms. At some point in the future, we will try to add the
ability to observe the negative of an attribute, but this mechanism
in not currently present.</P>

<H2>Observers vs. Commands</H2>

<H4><B>The Same Thing...</B></H4>

<P>If one takes a step back and looks at the command architecture,
you can see the observer relationship in it. The widget observes the
command's enabled state. Since the command is actually fulfilled by
appcore code, and the AppCore code decides when to enable or disable
the command, it is really the AppCore that owns the command node. The
command node is surfacing a capability of the AppCore to the widget
via the AOM in much the same way that a broadcaster node surfaces a
state of the AppCore to the widget.</P>

<H4><B>...Only Different</B></H4>

<P>The general observer mechanism implies an observed persistent
state. The AppCore has a state, such as "LoadProgress" which is
expressed via an AOM node with a progress percentage as a parameter.
This is a persistent state of the AppCore which is then expressed
through the AOM node.</P>

<P>Contrast this with a command node. A command node is a binding
between the widget's AOM node and some code that fulfills the
function of the widget. A command node is not a representation of
persistent state (with the exception of the command's enabled state).
Primarily, the command node is simply a transport path for getting
something done in response to a user interacting with a widget.</P>
