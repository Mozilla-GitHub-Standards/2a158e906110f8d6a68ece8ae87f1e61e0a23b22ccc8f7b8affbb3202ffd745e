<H2>XPToolkit Open Issues</H2>

At Netscape, we call 'em snakes, and we have three rules of snakes:
<OL>
<LI>
If you see a snake, don't form a committee, don't send a memo - kill the
snake.

<LI>
Don't play with dead snakes.

<LI>
All opportunities start out looking like snakes.
</OL>
Here is our current (but actually way out of date) list of snakes.
Please post corrections, additions, updates to&nbsp; <A HREF="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.xpfe">netscape.public.mozilla.xpfe</A>
<OL>
<P><LI>
Windowless widgets... what we want/need to do with our widgets to make
them look/feel native etc.&nbsp; If we get this wrong, we will go down
in flames.

<P><LI>
MacOS Raptor, er, Gecko embedding.

<P><LI>
Mac rendering (GFX, View system).&nbsp; We have a common UI, but it won't
be a common rendering model until it actually does the same thing on each
platform.

<P><LI>
Text Field seems to be a hot potato that Karnaze wants to be handled by
Ender but it's not currently not something they want to do (they're already
the long pole for 5.0). Since this has ramifications for double byte input
(how often do we really want to implement it) we need a definite answer
to this one soon. (tentative decision on this one- Ender will supply a
an XP widget for we'll use native forms widgets as best we can.

<P><LI>
Tab behavior in a text field isn't consistent in pre-5.0 versions - on
a Mac a tab is inserted into the field but on Windows the tab shifts focus
to the next text field (Unix behavior unknown).&nbsp; Should we make all
platforms consistent in 5.0?

<P><LI>
Input from the XPApp group is that we really want to use native services
(i.e. WASTE on the Mac, the equivalent on other platforms) for the text
entry field rather than rolling a new version Scott, want to write a new
text editor?&nbsp; :-)

<P><LI>
Combo Boxes &amp; List Box form elements have always sucked on the Mac
since there isn't a direct equivalent to the Windows combobox for the former
and the latter is limited to fewer fields than other platforms.&nbsp; For
5.0 it would really be nice to achieve parity.

<P><LI>
Replacing the List Manager based listbox for the Mac may be too complex
to fit into the 5.0 schedule.&nbsp; The 'implement improved Mac listbox'
task SWAG is based on the lower risk alternative of abstracting the text
for the list items so the size limit becomes the size/number of items.
The improved combobox is a low risk item.
