<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This document is not intended to be a comprehensive syntax or reference manual. 
  With care and time, it should grow into a useful starting place for making windows 
  and writing dialogs. The <a href="mailto:danm@netscape.com">author</a> thinks 
  that feedback on what's missing from the document would help build a better 
  document, so the quality of this thing is in the reader's hands. Keep that in 
  mind while you're cursing me.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this document also serves as a roadmap of XPFE's dialog story. 
  Interested parties would please review it to determine whether the package we 
  plan to deliver will meet their needs.</p>
<h2>Direction</h2>
<p>Current XPFE design goals state that dialogs get no special treatment; they're 
  just windows like any other. Windows can have parent windows, and be displayed 
  modally, and have control callbacks, and so behave like dialogs. But our goal 
  is that the same application code that instantiates a browser window will serve 
  equally to instantiate a dialog window. The difference lies in the window content, 
  and a couple of parameters controlling modality and that sort of thing.</p>
<h2>JavaScript vs C++</h2>
<p>Currently, all window control mechanisms flow through JavaScript. That is, 
  any capabilities a window may have besides taking up space on the desktop are 
  specified in the XUL describing the window, and the binding between the window 
  content and the application is done through JavaScript in the XUL. That binding 
  can be very short: it can fall through to application C code very quickly, but 
  JavaScript will be part of the process. (Note that we have not yet run into 
  any threading problems with this model, but we kind of expect to.)</p>
<p>JavaScript is easily added to a window: just include it in the XUL window description 
  and follow a short but peculiar dance to hook it up. Hooking up C code involves 
  writing a C++/JavaScript interface, and calling it from JavaScript. That interface 
  is an AppCore, and there's a separate and much more impressive <a href="appCore/appcores.html">document</a> 
  describing them and explaining how to build them.</p>
<h2>Make a Window</h2>
<p>So, there are two ways to make a window or dialog: directly through C++ and 
  from JavaScript. The resulting window is an instance of <code>nsWebShellWindow</code>. 
  This means it currently contains a hulking bunch of hackery for hooking up browser-window 
  specific contents. This causes no harm, and will be cleaned up in the future.</p>
<p>Note that modal dialogs or alerts are currently working only on Windows and 
  the Macintosh, and even then, only for modal dialogs created on the UI thread. 
  That is to say, they're only halfway there. Also note that windows are not sized 
  to content. These are merely somewhat glorified browser windows, to which automatically 
  sizing themselves to match their content is something of an eyebrow-furrowing 
  concept. Specifying the size of a dialog is another future enhancement.</p>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p><code>window.open</code> will open a XUL window if given a XUL URL to load. 
  It will open the given URL as the contents of a browser window, unless the <code>chrome</code> 
  feature is specified in <code>window.open</code>'s third (&quot;features&quot;) 
  parameter. Mozilla supports an extended form of <code>window.open</code> which 
  can be used to pass parameters back and forth to the dialog window. It's named 
  <code>window.openDialog</code>, reasonably enough, for now. Both <code>window.openDialog</code> 
  and <code>chrome</code> are described in <a href="languageSpec.html#jsextensions">JavaScript 
  Extensions</a>.</p>
<p>Another JavaScript interface is a Mozilla AppCore named <code>ToolkitCore</code>. 
  It contains a handful of windowing utility functions which were more useful 
  before <code>window.open</code> was working properly. <code>ToolkitCore</code> 
  will probably be deprecated soon.</p>
<pre><code>
 function MakeDialog() {
   var newWindow = window.open(&quot;resource://res/samples/madedialog.xul&quot;,
                     &quot;itsname&quot;, &quot;chrome&quot;);
 }</code></pre>
or, alternatively for now,
<pre><code>
 function MakeDialog() {
    var toolkitCore = XPAppCoresManager.Find("ToolkitCore");
    if (!toolkitCore) {
      toolkitCore = new ToolkitCore();
      if (toolkitCore)
        toolkitCore.Init("ToolkitCore");
    }
    if (toolkitCore)
      toolkitCore.ShowWindow("resource://res/samples/madedialog.xul",
          window);
  }</code></pre>
<p>An <code>XPAppCoresManager</code> is pre-constructed; you can access it without 
  any more preparation than shown above. <code>ToolkitCore</code> is not; it requires 
  that small bit of preparation.</p>
<h3>C++</h3>
There are two interfaces for opening new windows from C code. They are equivalent 
in the sense that either will make a new window, and both share their innermost 
important bits. The reason for having both is part historical, and part momentum. 
In the future, we'd like to meld the two into one. 
<h4>nsIAppShellService::CreateTopLevelWindow</h4>
<p>The primary C++ interface is <code>nsIAppShellService::CreateTopLevelWindow()</code>. 
  It's currently very clunky and will change (you'll see that statement many times 
  in this document). But at time of writing, you create a new window like this:</p>
<pre><code>
  nsresult              rv;
  nsIAppShellService    *appShell;
  nsIURL                *url;
  nsIWebShellWindow     *parent, *window;
  nsIStreamObserver     *observer;
  nsIXULWindowCallbacks *callbacks;
  PRInt32               width, height;

  window = nsnull;
  rv = nsServiceManager::GetService(kAppShellServiceCID,
         kIAppShellServiceIID,
         (nsISupports**) &appShell);
  if (NS_SUCCEEDED(rv)) {
    appShell->CreateTopLevelWindow(parent, url, PR_TRUE,
                window, observer, callbacks, width, height);
    nsServiceManager::ReleaseService(kAppShellServiceCID,
                appShell);
  }</code></pre>
<p>At time of writing, only <code>url</code>, <code>showWindow</code>, <code>window</code>, 
  <code>aInitialWidth</code> and <code>aInitialHeight</code> are actually used. 
  <code>url</code> is an URL describing the contents of the window. <code>window</code> 
  is returned from the function, set to the created window. See the code for descriptions 
  of the other parameters. This interface is a little rife with silly parameters, 
  and is slowly being cleaned up.</p>
<p>There is another very similar method <code>nsIAppShellService::CreateDialogWindow()</code>. 
  It takes the same parameters and currently functions exactly the same. These 
  two methods are planned to differ only in the kind of border used on the window 
  created. At time of writing, this decision is made at the time the window is 
  created, before any instructions in the file behind the URL could be read and 
  used to help make the decision.</p>
<p>At this time, window descriptions must be loaded from an URL. There will additionally 
  be methods for loading windows from a stream. In fact, XPFE want to say the 
  stream will be the preferred method, though the URL method will probably remain. 
  Streams will disengage the toolkit further from the source of the window description, 
  and will be our method for creating windows whose XUL is calculated at runtime, 
  rather than being distributed as a file.</p>
<h4>nsIDOMWindow::OpenDialog</h4>
<p>The other C++ interface is <code>nsIDOMWindow::OpenDialog</code>. It has the 
  advantage that it behaves exactly like the JavaScript <code>window.openDialog</code> 
  function, being the same code used by that function, after all.</p>
<p>The close association between this function and JavaScript places constraints 
  on its usage. Any parameters sent to this function must be ready for use in 
  JavaScript handlers built into the new window, and so must be fitted into JavaScript 
  wrappers. There must also be a &quot;parent&quot; window available to do the 
  window opening and provide a JavaScript context.</p>
<p>The function to wrap a series of arguments is called <code>JS_PushArguments</code>, 
  and is defined in <code>jsapi.h</code>. Its mysterious third argument is explained 
  in that same header file. The sample code below will call <code>OpenDialog</code>, 
  given an <code>nsIDOMWindow</code> to work with. The arguments to <code>OpenDialog</code> 
  are exactly those from its JavaScript definition, explained in <a href="languageSpec.html#jsextensions">JavaScript 
  Extensions</a>. The first three are standard <code>Open</code> arguments. The 
  remainder are parameters for the new window. That new window will have a property 
  named <code>arguments</code>. It's an array, and <code>arguments[0]</code> is 
  the string &quot;I was born a C string&quot;, while <code>arguments[1]</code> 
  is the number 298. </p>
<pre><code>DoOpenDialog(nsIDOMWindow* aParent) {

  if (!aParent)
    return NS_ERROR_NULL_POINTER;

  nsresult rv = NS_ERROR_FAILURE;
  JSContext *jscx = 0;
  nsIDOMWindow *newWindow;

  // get the parent window's JS Context (this is not really a blessed thing
  // to do, but I believe it's all we have. it wants to be a real interface
  // someday.)
  nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIScriptGlobalObject&gt; scriptGlobalObj = do_QueryInterface(aParent);
  if (scriptGlobalObj) {
    nsCOMPtr&lt;nsIScriptContext&gt; scriptcx;
    scriptGlobalObj-&gt;GetContext(getter_AddRefs(scriptcx));
    if (scriptcx)
      jscx = (JSContext *) scriptcx-&gt;GetNativeContext();
  }

  // if everything went as planned...
  if (jscx) {

    // build a JavaScript &quot;arguments&quot; array for the OpenDialog function
    void *mark;
    jsval *argv;

    argv = JS_PushArguments(jscx, &amp;mark, &quot;ssssu&quot;,
      &quot;resource://res/samples/paramdialog.xul&quot;,
      &quot;windowName&quot;,
      &quot;chrome&quot;,
      &quot;I was born a C string&quot;,
      (uint32) 298);

    // if that worked, call the function.
    if (argv) {
      aParent-&gt;OpenDialog(jscx, argv, 5, &amp;newWindow);
      JS_PopArguments(jscx, mark);
      rv = NS_OK;
    }
  }

  return rv;
}</code></pre>
<h2>Load a Window</h2>
<p>Between making and showing the window, there is a callback. The resulting <code>nsWebShellWindow</code> 
  comes with an associated DOM content model. Any initial control settings or 
  content changes which must be made before the window is actually shown can be 
  done at the time of this callback.</p>
<p>This callback is any JavaScript specified as the value of the <code>onload</code> 
  attribute of the <code>&lt;window&gt;</code> element. In the example below, 
  the window start tag is declared</p>
<code>&lt;window ... onload=&quot;Startup()&quot;&gt;</code> 
<p>During the <code>onload</code> callback, dialog authors are free to 
  alter control settings from JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>
  function Startup() {
    // yellowize and check the "ow" button
    document.bgColor = "yellow";
    var checkbox = document.getElementByID("ow");
    if (checkbox)
      checkbox.checked = true;
  }</code></pre>
<p>Except that not all properties are hooked up yet. The change to background 
  color in the example won't do anything. But the important example does work!</p>
<p>Dialog preprocessing can also be done in C by defining an AppCore, loading 
  and calling it from the <code>Startup()</code> method, as the <code>ToolkitCore</code> 
  AppCore was called to create the window.</p>
<h2>Debrief a Window</h2>
<p>After the dialog has run -- a dismissal button has been clicked, say -- dialog 
  users will need a callback in which to query the current control settings. As 
  always, this will be done by walking the DOM content model, and accessed through 
  a JavaScript hook.</p>
<p>We are uncertain whether a specific callback need be added: the event handler 
  for the dismissal buttons may be entirely sufficient. But as the reader has 
  no doubt guessed, there is no specific debriefing hook implemented at this time.</p>
<p>Data can be passed back to the calling window in more than one way. The dialog 
  window and opener can agree to share information as properties added to the 
  JavaScript dialog window object. Alternatively, the two windows could agree 
  that the dialog window will call some function of its opener. A third way could 
  be for the opener to use <code>window.openDialog</code> to pass parameters by 
  reference to the dialog window. Any changes made by the dialog to these parameters 
  would be visible in the opener window. See <a href="languageSpec.html#jsextensions">JavaScript 
  Extensions</a> or the <a href="#examples">examples</a> for details. Two files 
  in the source code at <code>mozilla/xpfe/browser/samples/dexparam*.xul</code> 
  are a kind of test suite for parameter passing, and consequently spell out more 
  details than will this document.</p>
<p>Note at time of writing, a dialog window, once closed, cannot be successfully 
  accessed from JavaScript through the variable which was returned by <code>window.open</code>. 
  This is a known bug, and wants fixing.</p>
<h2><a name="examples"></a>Examples</h2>
<p>The following XUL describes a browser window with a simple toolbar containing 
  a single button which will open another window: a nonmodal dialog, with a bit 
  of imagination. It uses the extended <code>window.open</code> syntax to pass 
  parameters to the dialog window. The dialog window uses these parameters to 
  initialize its settings. It then passes the state of its checkbox back to the 
  caller, in that same parameter.</p>
<pre><code>

    dump(&quot;dumping object: &quot; + what + &quot;\n&quot;);
    for (prop in what)

  &lt;/xul:toolbar&gt;
&lt;/xul:toolbox&gt;
&lt;/xul:window&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Note that only html widgets will have the expected html-specific DOM attributes 
  like &quot;checked&quot; for checkboxes. XUL buttons will respond to their own 
  APIs (to be documented in separate, dedicated papers), as well as to the core 
  DOM interfaces. Generally, as in <code>titledbutton</code> above, attribute 
  names match their HTML counterparts. But see specific widget documentation to 
  be certain.</p>
<p>The above code will produce a live window with a functional button if placed 
  in a file named, perhaps, <code>makedialog.xul</code> in the <code>res/samples</code> 
  subdirectory within the directory containing <code>apprunner</code>. (Placing 
  it in that directory allows it to find the stylesheet <code>xul.css</code> mentioned 
  in the stylesheet processing instruction.) Launch <code>apprunner</code> pointing 
  at that URL to load it into the main window.</p>
<p><code>apprunner -url resource:/res/samples/makedialog.xul</code></p>
<p>A suitable dialog description XUL file (named <code>madedialog.xul</code> in 
  the above code) will be loaded when the <code>Make Dialog</code> button is pressed. 
  The following example contains initialization code as mentioned in this document.</p>
<p>The authors have turned a jaundiced eye toward any sense of aesthetics in the 
  design of this dialog. It's ugly. It will show up directly on top of the main 
  &quot;browser&quot; window. I plan to rely on the estimable work of a colleague 
  to provide some documentation for what sorts of visual effects can be accomplished 
  with dialog controls and provide a link to a separate document with prettier 
  samples.</p>
