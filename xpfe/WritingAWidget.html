<H1>Birthing a Widget</H1>


<P><I>Written by Dave Hyatt<BR>
  Last Modified 12/04/98</I></P>

<P>This document contains a list of the steps involved in creating a new widget 
  (and in making sure that it is possible to instantiate the widget from within 
  the viewer test app).</P>

<P><B>The Interface</B></P>

<P>You should first decide whether or not your widget is implementing an interface 
  in addition to nsIWidget (e.g., if you're writing a toolbar you might need to 
  have an nsIToolbar interface). This interface is only necessary if you have 
  specific additional interface methods that you expect will be necessary in order 
  to effectively communicate with the widget.</P>

<P>Some sample code shown below illustrates how a stubbed interface for a new 
  widget might look:</P>

<PRE>#ifndef nsIMyInterface_h___
#define nsIMyInterface_h___

// <I>{FC41CD61-796E-11d2-BF86-00105A1B0627}</I>
#define NS_IMYINTERFACE_IID      \
{ 0xfc41cd61, 0x796e, 0x11d2, { 0xbf, 0x86, 0x0, 0x10, 0x5a, 0x1b, 0x6, 0x27 } }

class nsIMyInterface : public nsISupports
{
public:
	NS_IMETHOD ASampleMethod() = 0;
};

#endif /* nsIMyInterface_h___ */</PRE>

<P>Note the #define at the top of the file. This is an <I>interface ID</I>, a 
  way of uniquely identifying your new interface. You can generate new IIDs by 
  running the guidgen program. 
</P>

<P>Your interface will typically inherit from nsISupports 
  (thus picking up AddRef, QueryInterface, 
  and Release). Methods in your 
  interface should be pure virtual functions, and have a return value of nsresult. 
  The macro NS_METHOD takes care of declaring the function virtual and giving 
  it a return value of nsresult. 
  (Also make sure your interfaces don't take non-interface structs or classes 
  as arguments. Don't pass around non-interface pointers to structs or classes 
  either.)</P>

<P>Once you've made your interface, you need to make sure it gets exported where 
  others can see it. This document will assume that you're adding something to 
  mozilla/widget. Interfaces are 
  placed into the public subdirectory 
  of widget. You will need to modify the Makefile.in 
  and makefile.win files 
  in that directory for Linux and Windows.</P>

<P><B>The Class</B></P>

<P>Now that you have the interface specified, you'll want to write your implementation. 
  Let's look at a sample .h file for your new widget first.</P>

<PRE>#ifndef nsMyWidget_h___
#define nsMyWidget_h___

#include "nsIMyWidget.h"

class nsMyWidget : public nsIMyWidget, public nsWindow
{
public:
    nsMyWidget();
    virtual ~nsMyWidget();

    // <I>nsISupports Interface</I>
    NS_DECL_ISUPPORTS
	
    // <I>nsIMyWidget Interface</I>
    NS_IMETHOD ASampleMethod();

protected:
    void MyOwnInternalMethod();

protected:
    // <I>Data members</I>
};

#endif /* nsMyWidget_h___ */</PRE>

<P>Your class inherits from your new interface (assuming you have one) and from 
  another class (e.g., nsWindow) 
  that ultimately inherits from nsIWidget 
  (and that provides an implementation for nsIWidget's methods). Your class should 
  declare a constructor, since you will need to initialize your mRefCnt 
  variable (which is part of the implementation of nsISupports). 
</P>

<P>In order to say that your widget is implementing the nsISupports 
  functions you use the macro NS_DECL_ISUPPORTS. This puts the member functions 
  for AddRef, QueryInterface, 
  and Release into your header 
  file and ensures that your class has a member variable (mRefCnt) 
  for reference counting.</P>

<P>Note that your class can contain as many additional internal methods as you 
  need, although anyone referring to your class through an interface won't be 
  able to invoke these methods.</P>

<P>The corresponding .cpp file for this class follows.</P>

<PRE>#include "nsWindow.h"
#include "nsMyWidget.h"

static NS_DEFINE_IID(kIMyWidgetIID, NS_IMYWIDGET_IID);

// <I>ISupports Implementation</I>
NS_IMPL_ADDREF(nsMyWidget)
NS_IMPL_RELEASE(nsMyWidget)

nsresult nsTreeView::QueryInterface(REFNSIID aIID, void** aInstancePtr)      
{                                                                        
  if (NULL == aInstancePtr) {                                            
    return NS_ERROR_NULL_POINTER;                                        
  }                                                                      
  if (aIID.Equals(kIMyWidgetIID)) {                                          
    *aInstancePtr = (void*) (nsIMyWidget *)this;                                        
    AddRef();                                                           
    return NS_OK;                                                        
  }     
  return (nsWindow::QueryInterface(aIID, aInstancePtr));
} </PRE>

<PRE>// <I>nsIMyWidget Implementation</I>
NS_METHOD nsMyWidget::ASampleMethod()
{
  // <I>Do some stuff</I>
  return NS_OK;
}
// <I>nsMyWidget Methods</I>

nsMyWidget::nsMyWidget() : nsIMyWidget(), nsWindow()
{
  NS_INIT_REFCNT();
}

nsMyWidget::~nsMyWidget()
{}

void nsMyWidget::MyOwnInternalMethod()
{
  // <I>Do stuff</I>
}</PRE>

<P>The NS_DEFINE_IID macro simply places an ID into a variable (which is passed 
  in as the first argument to the macro). You can then use the variable within 
  the file to refer to the ID. </P>

<P>AddRef and Release implementations for nsISupports are specified using the 
  NS_IMPL_ADDREF and NS_IMPL_RELEASE macros. QueryInterface you have to write 
  yourself. The implementation shown in the .cpp file above shows the proper code 
  for returning an interface pointer to your new interface. If another interface 
  ID is requested, then it passes the buck to nsWindow (which can handle requests 
  for nsISupports and nsIWidget interfaces).</P>

<P>The constructor for the class contains a macro called NS_INIT_REFCNT, which 
  takes care of initializing your ref count variable (that you got by saying you 
  implemented nsISupports in the header file). </P>

<P>The sample interface method for the nsIMyWidget interface uses the NS_METHOD 
  macro to declare its return value. (Use NS_IMETHOD in your .h files, and NS_METHOD 
  in your .cpp files.) An interface method that succeeds should return NS_OK.</P>

<P><B>Where does the widget implementation go?</B></P>

<P>If you are implementing an entirely cross-platform widget (like the tree view 
  and toolbar), then you should place your .h and .cpp files into the xpwidgets 
  directory under mozilla/widget/src. 
  If you are writing a platform-specific widget, then it should go under the directory 
  for that platform, e.g., mozilla/widget/src/windows.</P>

<P>The makefiles in the corresponding directory should be modified to add your 
  .cpp files. (Makefile.in and makefile.win in most cases.)</P>

<P><B>Teaching the widget library to instantiate your widget </B></P>

<P>Now that you have a widget ready to go, you need to make sure that the <I>widget 
  factory </I>knows how to instantiate your widget when a request comes in to 
  create an instance of the widget. First, you need to make a <I>class ID </I>for 
  your widget implementation. While the IID (the interface ID) uniquely identifies 
  the interface, this CID uniquely identifies your specific implementation. There 
  is a one-to-many mapping from an interface to implementations of that interface. 
  You can use guidgen to generate 
  a class ID for your implementation.</P>

<P>You then need to add your class ID to the nsWidgetsCid.h 
  header file (found in the mozilla/widget/public 
  directory).</P>

<P>A sample snippet of what you have to add for you widget implementation is shown 
  below:</P>

<PRE>// <I>{0FAF80A1-815C-11d2-96ED-00104B7B7DEB}</I>
#define NS_MYWIDGET_CID	\
{ 0xfaf80a1, 0x815c, 0x11d2, { 0x96, 0xed, 0x0, 0x10, 0x4b, 0x7b, 0x7d, 0xeb } }</PRE>

<P>Now that you have a CID for your implementation, you have to make sure that 
  the widget factory knows to make your object when it gets a request with your 
  CID attached to it. Each platform (e.g., GTK, Mac, Windows) has a widget factory 
  file in the mozilla/widget/src/build 
  directory. For example, the windows factory implementation is nsWinWidgetFactory.cpp. 
</P>

<P>(1) Near the top of the file are the #includes. You should add the header file 
  for your implementation to this list, e.g., #include &quot;nsMyWidget.h&quot;. 
</P>

<P>(2) Put your CID into a variable for later use in the section where all the 
  NS_DEFINE_IID macros are used for all of the implementations the factory knows 
  about.</P>

<P>static NS_DEFINE_IID(kCMyWidget, NS_MYWIDGET_CID);</P>

<P>(3) There should be some code to instantiate different widgets in <I>CreateInstance</I>. 
  Your code snippet should be added to the series of if-else statements. It will 
  look something like this.</P>

<PRE>else if (mClassID.Equals(kCMyWidget)) {
		inst = (nsISupports*)(nsWindow*)new nsMyWidget();
}</PRE>

<P>Do this in each factory .cpp file for each platform your widget supports.</P>

<P><B>Teaching the Viewer App To Instantiate My Widget</B></P>

<P>This section is just a quick and dirty explanation of how to make sure you 
  can instantiate your widget from somewhere within the viewer app. This is just 
  what to do to make your code work with the viewer app. (The viewer code is under 
  mozilla/webshell/tests/viewer.)</P>

<P>(1) In nsSetupRegistry.cpp, 
  you should use NS_DEFINE_IID to define kCMyWidget. 
  Then add the following snippet of code to NS_SetupRegistry</P>

<PRE>nsRepository::RegisterFactory(kCMyWidgetCID, WIDGET_DLL, PR_FALSE, PR_FALSE);   </PRE>

<P>(2) When you actually need to instantiate your widget, you can use a code snippet 
  similar to the one below:</P>

<PRE>
nsIMyWidget* pMyWidget;
nsresult rv = nsRepository::CreateInstance(kCMyWidgetCID, nsnull, 
					   kIMyWidgetIID,
					   (void**)&pMyWidget);
if (NS_OK != rv) {
  return;
}</PRE>

<P>You'll know all of this was successful if rv is NS_OK after you make the CreateInstance 
  call. </P>
