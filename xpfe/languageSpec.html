<h2>Second Draft preamble</h2>

<P>Mozilla has configurable, downloadable chrome, meaning that the arrangement 
  and even presence or absence of controls in the main window is not hardwired 
  into the application, but loaded from a separate UI description. In fact, most 
  of Mozilla's windows (and dialogs) will be described using this mechanism. XUL 
  (pronounced "zuul," as if that spelling helped any, and short for "XML-based 
  User Interface Language") is our name for the language in which these UI descriptions 
  are built.</P>

<P>Window chrome is displayed and managed by the same layout engine
that manages HTML content in the browser. UI descriptions, then, look
a great deal like HTML 4. XUL is an application of XML. In fact, it
<I>is</I> just XML with specific meaning defined for a few element
types, and into which HTML can be scattered.</P>

<P>Readers of the First Draft of this document will notice that a
fundamental change has taken place in the way a UI is described. The
first draft documented an intention to add springs and struts to the
layout model, and spent a great deal of time worrying about keeping
the content in separate files from specific (perhaps different on
different platforms) layout instructions: the separation of content
and form. The springs and struts layout model has been abandoned in
favor of an HTML 4/CSS model, and the separation of content and form,
beyond the not inconsiderable capabilities provided by those
standards, has been recognized as overly ambitious.</P>

<H2>Terms</H2>

<P>"XPFE" is the term Mozilla-the-organization is using to describe
Mozilla-the-browser's Cross Platform Front End, because X and C look
similar if you beat them long and hard with a hammer. The intention
is to build cross-platform applications like browsers and mail
clients from a set of tools designed for that purpose. The intention
is <I>not</I> to implement a generic cross-platform application
framework. That's been done, and is a great deal of work. We intend
to provide a subset of cross-platform functionality suitable for
building network applications like browsers, leveraging the
cross-platform functionality already built into Gecko, Mozilla's HTML
layout engine.</P>

<P>The term "cross-platform UI" is somewhat misleading. UI designers
will be able to create UI descriptions which will work on multiple
platforms. But proper UI descriptions which take into account various
platforms' differing ideas about proper placement of such things as
dialog buttons will require some platform-specific work. A single XUL
specification can only cross-platform to a degree. UI designers and
build engineers will need to maintain separate, platform-specific
versions of at least some XUL documents.</P>

<P>"XPToolkit" is rather synonymous with XPFE. Though the former term
seems more concrete than the other, and therefore is not an exact
replacement, no one is completely certain why we have both.</P>

<P>"XUL" already introduced, is an application of XML used to
describe the layout of most windows in the Mozilla browser, including
and especially the main, browser window.</P>

<H2>Scope</H2>

<P>This paper makes no attempt to explain requirements. We don't have
a current "requirements" document. <A HREF="aom/AOM.html">XPToolkit
Architecture</A> is a better place to gain an understanding of such
things. This paper contains a short introduction to Mozilla front-end
architecture, concentrating on the task of building UIs. It is, as
always, incomplete.</P>

<P>Mozilla applications will be built of "small" components like
dialog buttons and mail inbox folders, which we collectively term
"widgets." Within a widget, drawing and user interactions are
completely under control of the individual widget, and set when the
widget was built. Relative placement of widgets, their interactions
with each other, and optionally some of their configuration, will be
controlled by a UI layout specified in a script whose structure is
defined in this and related documents.</P>

<P>Widgets are pieces of the application largely self-contained,
generally corresponding to a rectangle of window real estate. Widgets
will generally live grouped in separate, dynamically loaded
libraries. A widget may expect to own a piece of a window (a toolbar
or toolbar set), or it may be expected to work within or without a
window (menubars, depending on the platform). It may not be a part of
the application UI at all.</P>

<P>Widgets will have predefined behaviour, set at compilation. Buttons will respond 
  to the mouse; toolbars will act as containers for buttons. The effect a widget 
  will have on its application will be defined as a combination of predefined 
  application behaviour and linkage between the widgets. This linkage can be accomplished 
  by including JavaScript in the XUL, or by application code which walks the content 
  model after it has been built from XUL, and hooks up event listeners. Generally 
  a real application will use some combination of the two.</P>
<P>Applications, for instance, will have preconceived notions of what to do when 
  they receive an "open file" command. An "open" button is simply a button. It 
  will send its command to the application for processing, generally using some 
  simple JavaScript for linkage.</P>

<P>We are at first primarily concerned with the obvious UI
components: toolbars, menus and dialogs. Conceptually, the XUL
language will allow someone with a text editor, given a package of
components which can work together, the ability to put together an
application by specifying something like this (for an application on
an OS using menubars across the top of its applications'
windows):</P>

<PRE>main window containing
  menubar area at top across width of window containing
    menubar (and its contents)
  toolbar area below menubar across width of window containing
    main toolbar (and its contents)
  application-specific content area below toolbar area</PRE>

<H2>Structure of a XUL File</H2>

<P>Our language of choice is <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</A>,
flavoured with <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2">CSS</A>
stylistic information. Having said that, the details of a particular
application of XML; say, the syntax for specifying a toolbar, are
left to separate documents describing those particular applications.
Every widget built into Mozilla will need to have such a document.
Check the XPFE index for the most recent list.
<A NAME=widgetlist></A>At time of writing, authors of these widgets
have been kind enough to document their designs:</P>

<UL>
   <LI><A HREF="MenusSpec.html#Syntax">menus</A></LI>
   
   <LI><A HREF="ToolbarSpec.html#Syntax">toolbars</A></LI>
   
   <LI><A HREF="TreeSpec.html#Syntax">trees</A></LI>
   
   <LI><A HREF="menubutton/MenuButtonSpec.html#Syntax">image and menu
   buttons</A></LI>
   
   <LI><A HREF="progressbar/progressMeterSpec.html#Syntax">progress
   meter</A></LI>
</UL>

<P>Since XUL is a language for describing window layout, there is
some overlap in the topics covered by this document and separate
documents describing XUL windows.</P>

<UL>
   <LI><A HREF="dialogs.html">windows</A></LI>
   
   <LI><A HREF="dialogcookery.html">dialog cookbook</A></LI>
</UL>

<P>As pointed out in the above documents, the task of writing a XUL
window description is basically the same as the task of writing an
HTML content description, with these exceptions: the syntax is XML
(not that different from HTML 4), and there are some elements unique
to XUL. These elements are widgets and certain infrastructure
associated with the behaviour of the window, explained below.</P>

<P>Most of the details of writing a XUL document are identical to those for writing 
  an XML document, a description of which we will leave to other excellent XML 
  documentation which we assume must exist but have never seen. This document 
  will concentrate on XUL-specific features.</P>
<h3>A Word on Case and Namespaces, and Filetypes</h3>
<p>XML is of course case sensitive. XUL is equally so. Our current code tends 
  not to be strict about enforcing this, especially for tags and attributes in 
  the HTML namespace. This will change: tags and attributes will, as a rule, always 
  be lower case as suggested in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html-in-xml/">XHTML 
  Working Draft</a>.</p>
<p>Mozilla gives a special meaning to XUL files; it expects to find UI descriptions 
  within. For this reason, we've defined a MIME type "text/xul" mapped to files 
  with the extension ".xul". (For standards purposes, we will probably need to 
  change the the mime type to something like "text/x-xul".) These files are processed 
  using the same parser as "text/xml" files (and therefore subject to XML syntax 
  rules, as they should be). It's possible to load a XUL document from an XML 
  file (one named *.xml). The resulting UI will be created using an XML content 
  model. A XUL content model is generated from *.xul files. XML documents support 
  the basic DOM Level 1 Core APIs. XUL documents support an extended set, much 
  as HTML documents support DOM Level 1 HTML APIs. Mozilla's XUL content models 
  also support nifty features like local/remote merging; see the
  <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XUL_and_RDF:_The_Implementation_of_the_Application_Object_Model">XUL 
  and RDF document</a> for details. In general, you will want to store XUL in 
  *.xul files. </p>
<p>A XUL file can contain XML elements and HTML elements, as well as special elements 
  unique to XUL: XUL elements. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">Namespace</a> 
  declarations for XUL (and HTML, if HTML elements are used) must be included 
  in the file. Namespaces must be treated carefully. In general, a namespace need 
  be specified only for element tags; not for attributes. A widget specified</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html:button xul:onclick=&quot;DoSomething()&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>will almost certainly not work as expected; the onClick handler will probably 
  be lost (regardless of its correct use of case). In the absence of specific 
  instructions, expect a widget to expect its applicable attributes to require 
  no explicit namespace.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html:button onclick=&quot;DoSomething()&quot;&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;xul:titledbutton onclick=&quot;DoSomething()&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>That said, the HTML elements at time of writing tend not to care whether their 
  attributes have an HTML namespace or none at all, though sometimes they do exhibit 
  a preference and require a namespace to work as expected.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>XUL File Preamble</h3>
<P>XUL is XML, and a good XUL file begins with the standard XML version and DOCTYPE 
  statements.</P>
<P>Since XML has no implicit display semantics, there must always be associated 
  stylesheets. Mozilla includes a standard stylesheet, "xul.css". It is currently 
  built into the distribution at <code>resource:/res/samples/xul.css</code>. Generally, 
  you will want to include this style sheet in your files with a stylesheet processing 
  instruction.</P>
<P>And finally, any namespaces used in the document must be declared. Generally, 
  a XUL file will begin</P>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="xul.css" type="text/css"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE window&gt;
&lt;window xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<P>The HTML namespace is of course the standard one. The XUL namespace is obviously 
  a temporary one, but at least serves to explain the pronunciation. For the moment, 
  that exact namespace must be declared in any XUL file. Note that the above example 
  is using an implicit XUL namespace. This is optional; other examples in this 
  document will on occasion belabor the namespace issue by declaring each use 
  explicitly. </P>

<H3>Scripting</H3>
<P>A XUL interface is only a collection of disconnected widgets until it has been 
  programmed. &quot;Programming&quot; can be as simple as some JavaScript to tie 
  the widgets together and perhaps to give them extra functionality, or as complex 
  as application (C++) code which is free to do ... anything. This paper will 
  concentrate on JavaScript, deeming application programming to be beyond its 
  scope.</P>

<h4>JavaScript</h4>

<P>XUL can contain HTML content, including JavaScript. JavaScript functions may 
  be added in a fashion similar to HTML. There is no <CODE>&lt;head&gt;</CODE> 
  section of a XUL file, so script is just mixed in with the other content, delimited 
  by a <CODE>&lt;script&gt;</CODE> tag in the HTML namespace.</P>

<PRE><CODE>&lt;html:script&gt;
  // dialog initialization code
  function InitWindow() {
    var checkbox = document.getElementByID("remember");
    if (checkbox)
      checkbox.checked = true;
  }
&lt;/html:script&gt;</CODE></PRE>
<p>JavaScript can be referenced as in HTML documents: as <code>onClick</code> 
  handlers and the like. See individual <a href="#widgetlist">widget documentation</a> 
  for a list of attributes accepting JavaScript values.</p>
<p>JavaScript is most safely kept in a separate file and included in the XUL file</p>
<p><code>&lt;html:script language=&quot;javascript&quot; src=&quot;our.js&quot;/&gt;</code></p>
<p>or relegated to the contents of a CDATA section, to prevent the XML parser 
  from choking on JavaScript which may look like XML content (a <code>&lt;</code> 
  character, for instance.)</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html:script&gt;
  &lt;![CDATA[
    function lesser(a,b) {
      return a &lt; b ? a : b;
    }
  ]]&gt;
&lt;/html:script&gt;</code></pre>
<h4><a name="jsextensions"></a>JavaScript Extensions</h4>
<p>Mozilla has found it necessary to support a few extensions to standard JavaScript. 
  These are, well, nonstandard. They are therefore subject to change, and will 
  not work with other browser applications.</p>
<h5>window.open</h5>
<p><code>open(URL[, windowName [, windowFeatures]])</code></p>
<p>The standard syntax still applies. See a JavaScript reference for details. 
  Mozilla, however, understands a few extensions to <code>windowFeatures</code>. 
  The treatment of these extensions is somewhat confused in the name of backward 
  compatibility and because of the sometimes uneasy interplay between standards-compliant 
  <code>open</code> and the more freewheeling <code>openDialog</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>New Features 
    <ul>
      <li><code>titlebar</code> - The window can be created with or without a 
        titlebar.</li>
      <li><code>close</code> - The window can be created with or without a close 
        widget.</li>
      <li><code>chrome</code> - Normally, the URL given to <code>window.open</code> 
        is treated as a content URL. That is, Mozilla generates a browser window 
        and loads the given URL into its content area, as <code>window.open</code> 
        has always behaved. However, the presence of a <code>chrome</code> flag 
        in the <code>windowFeatures</code> parameter will cause the given URL 
        to be treated as the window chrome, itself. It will be treated as the 
        top-level window contents; it will not be wrapped in a browser window. 
        The window will also be sized to wrap its contents.</li>
      <li><code>dialog</code> - Use a dialog-style window border.</li>
      <li><code>modal</code> - The window will be run modally. The call to <code>window.open</code> 
        will not return until the user has dismissed the window. (Note this is 
        not working at time of writing.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Default Behaviour - As always, if no parameter is passed, all chrome is 
    assumed turned on. Exceptions are the behaviour flags <code>chrome</code>, 
    <code>dialog</code> and <code>modal</code>. If any string at all, even a zero-length 
    string, is given in the <code>features</code> parameter, any features not 
    explicitly mentioned are assumed off. <code>titlebar</code> and <code>close</code> 
    are the two exceptions: they are not considered off unless explicitly mentioned 
    (&quot;<code>titlebar=no</code>&quot;), since anything else would break extant 
    script.</li>
</ul>
<h5>window.openDialog</h5>
<p><code>openDialog(URL[, windowName [, windowFeatures [, args]]])</code></p>
<p><code>window.openDialog</code> is an extension to <code>window.open</code>. 
  It behaves the same, except that it can optionally take one or more parameters 
  past <code>windowFeatures</code>, and <code>windowFeatures</code> itself is 
  treated a little differently.</p>
<p>The optional parameters, if present, will be bundled up in a JavaScript array 
  and added to the newly created window as a property named <code>arguments</code>. 
  They may be referenced in the JavaScript of the window at any time, including 
  during the execution of an <code>onload</code> handler. These parameters may 
  be used, then, to pass arguments to and from the dialog window.</p>
<p>A dialog summoned up</p>
<p> <code>openDialog(&quot;http://zzz.xul&quot;, &quot;dlg&quot;, &quot;chrome&quot;, 
  &quot;pizza&quot;, 6.98)</code></p>
<p>could reference the &quot;pizza&quot; string as <code>window.arguments[0]</code>, 
  and the number as <code>window.arguments[1]</code>.</p>
<p><code>openDialog</code> treats the <code>features</code> parameter exactly 
  as does <code>open</code>, with the following differences.</p>
<ul>
  <li>New Features 
    <ul>
      <li><code>all</code> - Initially activates (or deactivates (&quot;<code>all=no</code>&quot;)) 
        all chrome (except the behaviour flags <code>chrome</code>, <code>dialog</code> 
        and <code>modal</code>). These can be overridden (so &quot;<code>menubar=no,all</code>&quot; 
        turns on all chrome except the menubar.) This feature is explicitly ignored 
        by <code>window.open</code>. <code>window.openDialog</code> finds it useful 
        because of its different default assumptions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Default behaviour - The chrome and dialog features are always assumed on, 
    unless explicitly turned off (&quot;<code>chrome=no</code>&quot;). <code>openDialog</code> 
    treats the absence of the features parameter as does window.open, except as 
    always, <code>chrome</code> and <code>dialog</code> are on. If the <code>features</code> 
    parameter is a zero-length string, or contains only one or more of the behaviour 
    features (<code>chrome</code>, <code>dialog</code> and <code>modal</code>) 
    the chrome features are assumed &quot;OS' choice.&quot; That is, window creation 
    code is not given specific instructions, but is instead allowed to select 
    the chrome that best fits a dialog on that operating system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this functionality may just be bundled up into <code>window.open</code>, 
  since there is no real conflict. Alternatively, <code>window.openDialog</code> 
  could in the future assume certain settings, such as the <code>chrome</code> 
  flag.</p>
<h4>DOM Extensions</h4>
<p>Since XUL is not the same thing as HTML, while XUL documents will support the 
  DOM Level 1 Core API, they will not support the DOM Level 1 HTML API. However, 
  Mozilla supports extended DOM functionality for the XUL content model, patterned 
  after the HTML extensions. At this time these additional DOM methods are available, 
  though the code is of course the most accurate place to look for this information. 
  These interfaces can be found in the directory <code>mozilla/rdf/content/public/idl</code>.</p>
<h5>XULDocument</h5>
<p><code>XULDocument</code> extends <code>Document</code> in a fashion similar 
  to <code>HTMLDocument</code>'s extension</p>
<pre><code>interface XULDocument : Document {

  Element getElementById(in DOMString id);
  NodeList getElementsByAttribute(in DOMString name, in DOMString value);
};</code></pre>
<p><code>getElementById</code> works like HTML's <code>getElementById</code>.</p>
<p><code>getElementsByAttribute</code> returns a list of <code>Elements</code> 
  for which the named attribute has the given value. A <code>value</code> of &quot;*&quot; 
  is a wildcard signifying all elements with the attribute.</p>
<h5>XULElement</h5>
<p><code>XULElement</code> extends <code>Element</code>.</p>
<pre><code>interface XULElement : Element {
  NodeList getElementsByAttribute(in DOMString name, in DOMString value);
};</code></pre>
<p><code>getElementsByAttribute</code> functions as does its namesake in <code>XULDocument</code>, 
  though this version returns only those elements which match the criteria and 
  are descendants (in CSS selector terminology) of the given element.</p>
<p><code>XULElement</code> also supports other methods for hooking up broadcasters; 
  a function performed automatically by the XUL document loader and therefore 
  not normally used in JavaScript.</p>
<H3>XUL Elements</H3>

<P>As mentioned above, a XUL file is mostly an HTML file with XML
syntax. A XUL file may contain nothing but HTML elements and be
completely functional. But XUL defines several element types unique
to itself, which add functionality to the window.</P>

<H4>Widgets</H4>

<P>Widgets are generally objects like form controls: buttons, text
boxes, tree controls and the like. A window can just as easily
contain HTML form elements (using the <CODE>html</CODE> namespace)
like any HTML content (though there is no need to put them within a
<CODE>&lt;form&gt;</CODE> tag).</P>

<P>XUL defines several new widget types, enumerated at <A HREF="neededWidgets.html">Required
Widgets</A>. Not all of these widgets have been implemented at time
of writing. Each widget will define a unique XML syntax for
describing itself; see the <A HREF="#widgetlist">widget
documentation</A> for details.</P>

<H4>Other Infrastructure</H4>

<P>Widgets may have JavaScript event handlers just as in HTML, and
are tied together using JavaScript and broadcaster nodes. Broadcaster
nodes are declared as <CODE>&lt;broadcaster&gt;</CODE> elements in
the XUL description, and are involved with the communication of
changes of state between widgets. A widget or several widgets can
arrange to have the value of one of their attributes be tied to a
broadcaster node. This tie is defined within the XUL:</P>

<PRE><CODE>&lt;xul:window xmlns:xul ="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"&gt; 
  &lt;xul:broadcaster id="canGoBack"/&gt;
  &lt;xul:titledbutton src="resource:/res/toolbar/TB_Back.gif"
    align="bottom" value="Back" onclick="BrowserBack()"&gt;
    &lt;xul:observes element="canGoBack" attribute="disabled"/&gt;
  &lt;/xul:titledbutton&gt;
&lt;/xul:window&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<P>But it is up to the application code to locate the broadcasters
within a window so it can punch them when necessary.</P>

<P>Broadcasters can broadcast any change of state, which can be tied
to the value of any attribute in another XUL widget. For more
complete documentation, see <A HREF="broadcasters.html">Broadcasters
and Observers</A>.</P>

<H3>Future Direction</H3>

<P>Ideally, packages of XUL UI descriptions could be shipped in a
single file something like</P>

<PRE><CODE>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="xul.css" type="text/css"?&gt; 
&lt;!DOCTYPE package&gt;
&lt;package xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"&gt; 
  &lt;window id="main"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/window&gt;
  &lt;window id="help"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/window&gt;
&lt;/package&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<P>And a window (or other service) could be instantiated by first
parsing the whole package and then picking out a window from its
contents</P>

<PRE><CODE>Package *package = LoadPackage("http://xxx/package.xul");
InstantiateWindow(package, GetNodeWithID("main");
</CODE></PRE>

<P>This happy scheme doesn't work today, because the code expects the
result of parsing an XML document to be a window. So currently, a
single XUL file must contain a single window.</P>

<PRE><CODE>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="xul.css" type="text/css"?&gt; 
&lt;!DOCTYPE window&gt;
&lt;window xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"&gt; 
  ...
&lt;/window&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<P>And the corresponding code is a little more slanted toward getting
a window</P>

<PRE><CODE>InstantiateWindow("http://xxx/window.xul");</CODE></PRE>

<P>We would like to head more toward the "package" implementation in
the future.</P>

<H2>Internationalization</H2>

<P>For practical reasons, the locale-specific attributes of a UI description would 
  be most happily developed (and possibly distributed) in separate files, where 
  localization can be performed by altering only a subset of the UI description 
  devoted expressly to localization issues. That is, a separate file of localized 
  strings.</P>

<P>Internationalization is discussed more completely in the <a href="../projects/intl/xul-styleguide.html">XUL 
  Coding Style Guidelines</a> document. In brief, Mozilla has settled on <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210#sec-references">XML 
  entities</A> as the mechanism. Entities are a feature of the language and therefore 
  outside the scope of this paper. A XUL file can be made localizeable very easily 
  by substituting entities for any content which may change as the locale changes. 
  The localized text must be defined in a separate <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210#sec-prolog-dtd">DTD</A> 
  or DTD fragment. The whole system is then configured with different locale-specific 
  DTDs, and the correct DTD will be chosen for a given XML file at runtime, depending 
  on the current locale settings. Mozilla will make that decision automatically 
  if the localized XML file specifies its DTD using a <a href="ConfigChromeSpec.html">chrome 
  URL</a>, as outlined in <a href="../projects/intl/xul-l10n.html#l12ydependency">XUL 
  Localizability Issues</a>.</P>
