<H1>What We Know So Far</H1>

<P>(or "When We Last Joined Our Heroes")</P>

Pinkerton</A> (<A HREF="mailto:pinkerton@netscape.com">pinkerton@netscape.com</A>)</P>

<P>This is a summary of where we think we are today. This will
change. This will probably be wrong in a few days. As we flesh things
out, this should turn into an overview document, but for now this is
what you get.</P>

<P>Please direct all comments to the <A HREF="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.xpfe">xpfe
newsgroup.</A></P>

<H2>XML-UI</H2>

<P>We want to allow clients (browser, composer, bookmarks, etc) to
build user interfaces by providing an XML file that specifies the
content. While we realize we can't do everything in 5.0, we want to
make sure we don't make any major mistakes in this language that
prevent us from doing the right thing in the future.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>The XML will be sucked into the layout engine and stored in a
   content model similar to that used by the layout engine for HTML
   content.</LI>
   
   <LI>The API to traverse this "UI Content Model" is the DOM.</LI>
   
   <LI>Look and Feel differences for various platforms, as well as
   the exact widgets that will be used to display that information on
   the various platforms will be separated into CSS-based style
   sheets.</LI>
   
   <LI>We would like to use XSL to do "transformations" on this "UI
   content".
   
   <UL>
      <LI>For example, the XML-UI specifies a "confirm" dialog style
      via a style sheet. This would transform the content tree to add
      the appropriate buttons (in the appropriate places) for a given
      platform.</LI>
   </UL>
   </LI>
   
   <LI>API's should be reflected into JavaScript as well as C++</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Configurable Chrome</H2>

<P>MozillaClassic had this great downloadable/configurable chrome
setup based on top of RDF API's and HT. We believe we may be able to
achieve the same effect by using the DOM as the way to access the
chrome content.</P>

<P>We have no idea what is the right way to do things, but having two
API's to access chrome content is bad, so is having two content
models.</P>

<P><B>Question</B>: If the content model in layout is on a
document-by-document basis, how can the DOM handle content that must
be shared and updated across browser windows (toolbar content, for
example).</P>

<P><B>Answer</B>: Implement a new type of DOM object that acts as a
Proxy for objects stored in a central "toolbar content model." When
things change in the central version, the proxy is notified. The
client (the toolbar, for example) still thinks it's just iterating
over the DOM. Attributes that change on a document basis (such as if
a particular toolbar is collapsed) can be stored in the proxy as
their effect is local to the document, not global to all
toolbars.</P>

<H2>Widgets</H2>

<P><B>Question</B>: Who owns the widgets now?</P>

<P><B>Answer</B>: For the most part, the XPToolkit team owns what is
in the mozilla/widget folder. Widgets that are required for a
majority of applications (toolbars, color picker, buttons) will
probably be implemented by us. Widgets that are needed for particular
applications will probably be implemented by that applications
group.</P>

page</A>.</P>

<H2>Open Issues For Now</H2>

<P>These are things that we haven't had a chance to think much about
yet, but know are big problems that we should worry about. For the
platform to succeed, we know we cannot forget about these issues.</P>

<H4>Drag and Drop</H4>

<P>We want to be able to specify drag and drop interactions in the
XML-UI as well as provide a cross-platform mechanism for doing drag
and drop correctly. This includes an infrastructure for things like
multiple drag flavors and drawing appropriate drop feedback.</P>

<H4>Context Menus</H4>

<H4>Tooltips</H4>

<P>For both of these, we want to be able to specify them in the
XML-UI. How we tie these into OS-specific mechanisms is still open
for debate. Maybe the XP-apps groups can help here.</P>
