<h2>
XPToolkit : Touchy-Feely Elevator Story:</h2>

<p><br>In the beginning, there were 3 front ends (FE's): mac, windows,
unix. Each took a suite of developers to maintain. Adding a new feature
(even just a button) required 3 engineers to waste at least a day (more
often a week) slaving away until the feature was complete. This had to
change.
<p>What if we could be in a world where we could just write the code once?
Where non-programmers could design the look and feel of a product using
W3C standards instead of C++? Where platform differences could be expressed
in stylesheets, not hardcoded with #ifdefs?
<p>Do you like that world? So do we.
