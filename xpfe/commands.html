<p>Draft 1: More terms in the Glossary. Changed name of Widget Controller to Window 
  Glue. Updated description of COM Connect and JavaScript linkage code. Many small 
  changes and additional explanation. Really, everything has been touched. Please 
  re-read. </p>
<p>This document is a written version of some of the concepts the XPFE team have 
  been discussing for building command structures in Seamonkey. &quot;Command 
  Structures&quot; are, basically, menus and toolbars and the framework which 
  binds them to the application shell and other widgets. The authors necessarily 
  make some assumptions about application architecture, and hope for feedback 
  from the XP Apps team.</p>
<p> Feedback is appreciated. We are particularly interested in opinions from members 
  of XPApps, who may be interested to know we are envisioning an architecture 
  for them, and from members of Gecko, who will know if some of our expected DOM 
  manipulations are feasible.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This document covers current XPFE team thoughts on command structure: the basic 
  syntax by which widgets and the commands they issue are specified in XUL, and 
  the communication pathways along which commands travel.</p>
<h2>Glossary</h2>
<p>Some terms used, some terms invented and some terms slightly misused in this 
  document</p>
<dl> 
  <span class="term"><dt>DOM</dt></span>
  <dd>The Document Object Model; the structure of an (HTML) document, represented 
    as a hierarchy of components with a standard API suitable for scripting. We 
    mention this because of the next definition.</dd>
  <span class="term"><dt>AOM</dt></span>
  <dd>The Application Object Model. This is the structure of the application, 
    specified as a hierarchy of elements in XUL and then modeled as a tree of 
    widgets and other objects. The concept and structure is similar to the content 
    model built by Gecko to represent an HTML document.</dd>
  <span class="term"><dt>Application</dt></span>
  <dd>a complete application, such as a browser or mail client. It is expected 
    that multiple applications can be hosted within a single executable.</dd>
  <span class="term"><dt>Application Shell</dt></span>
  <dd>the controlling application which arbitrates between all the individual 
    applications living within a single executable.</dd>
  <span class="term"><dt>Command</dt></span>
  <dd>An abstraction standing for the concept of of the command. In this paper, 
    &quot;Close Window&quot; and Copy to Clipboard are commands. This is in contrast 
    to the idea of executing the command, an idea for which this paper has no 
    special term. </dd>
  <span class="term"><dt>Window Glue</dt></span>
  <dd>Related to the idea of executing a command, this is the application code 
    that links command originators and recipients together. A better explanation 
    (one hopes) is built throughout the document.</dd>
  <span class="term"><dt>Widget</dt></span>
  <dd>A visible element of a window's UI. Described by a subtree of the AOM. While 
    it relies on Gecko for its positioning and sizing within its parent window, 
    its contents are owned only by itself. That is, it must be considered an atomic 
    rectangle by Gecko.</dd>
  <span class="term"><dt>Originating Widget</dt></span>
  <dd>A widget representing a command UI to its host application. A toolbar or 
    menu, generally, though hopefully the architecture proposed in this document 
    will not disallow the future inclusion of some unforeseen new control type. 
    (Note the ambiguity about which is a widget, a toolbar or a toolbar button?)</dd>
  <span class="term"><dt>Receiving Widget</dt></span>
  <dd>A widget interested in fulfilling a command. That is, a widget to which 
    an originating widget can send a command. Receiving widgets should always 
    be a top-level window, or an application, rather than a <span class="term">widget</span>, 
    as the term is defined above. In that sense, the term is misleading and may 
    be changed, though it provides a certain symmetry. The authors are prepared 
    to rescind this requirement should it become more liability than asset, but 
    at this time believe the restriction is not a hardship, and will ease the 
    task of finding receiving widgets when building the UI.</dd>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Command System Architecture in most GUI applications is fairly straightforward. 
  Menus, toolbars, buttons and the like exist in the UI. The application alters 
  their state directly (enabling and disabling them, for instance) when necessary. 
  The widgets interact with the user and issue commands to any receiver who cares 
  to listen (often, the application).</p>
<p>Mozilla supports a scriptable UI, &quot;downloadable chrome,&quot; and so can 
  find itself with a new and unexpected set of widgets at any time. The Command 
  System Architecture outlined in this document is a layer of abstraction between 
  the application code and the application UI. It allows the application to alter 
  the state of its command UI (enabling and disabling widgets, for instance) without 
  directly referencing the widgets themselves. And it allows those widgets to 
  hook into the application at runtime.</p>
<p>Another concern of the command system, peripheral to this document but not 
  completely outside it, is allowing the application shell to arbitrate between 
  different command UIs expected by its component applications and widgets. This 
  paper only gives that subject a name, Command Merging, and then touches on it 
  briefly. A full treatment will come with a later revision, or a second paper. 
</p>
<h2>Command Merging</h2>
<p>Mozilla design teams foresee a need for &quot;mergeable&quot; command widgets. 
  That is, the environment in which widgets will find themselves is a shared shell 
  in which different applications are running. These applications will have their 
  own disparate ideas of what they want in the main menu, and the main toolbar. 
  They may additionally have their own toolbars and menus. XPFE want to provide 
  an environment that allows these command structures to interleave automatically, 
  without special consideration from the hosted applications. This is a concern 
  of the shell application, and of the command widgets.</p>
<p>For example, a browser and a mail client inhabiting the same window will each 
  have a specific implementation of certain commands, such as Copy to Clipboard. 
  They will also have a set of commands unique to themselves, such as Open Inbox 
  or Load URL. If these applications share the same window, there must be an arbitration 
  mechanism by which the applications share the same UI space for their controls. 
  Some arbitration may also be necessary for separate widgets in the same window, 
  sharing a single command UI space.</p>
<p>This is a fairly complicated problem. XPApps and XPFE are currently trying 
  to figure out who owns it (oddly, both teams seem to want it.) XPFE originally 
  thought that merging wouldn't be necessary, but the problem of bringing up the 
  Composer UI in a variety of environments (Browser and Messenger) appears insurmountable 
  without this facility. A merging scheme seems a useful addition to the Command 
  System Architecture, but a specification for that will follow at a later time. 
  This paper is primarily concerned with the abstraction layer introduced above.</p>
<h2>Command Abstraction</h2>
<p>Because of its scriptable UI, Mozilla will need a command abstraction layer 
  -- an API with which applications and receiving widgets speak to create and 
  maintain originating widgets. An application's UI can be completely reworked 
  after the app has been compiled: UIs can be specified at nearly any time using 
  a XUL script. If applications speak to their command UI through an abstraction 
  layer which carries no knowledge of the UI implementation through to the client 
  applications, UI designers will need to operate under fewer constraints when 
  specifying UIs. XPFE believe this is an important consideration which should 
  be worked into the architecture.</p>
<p>This abstraction layer is the main thrust of this document. In particular, 
  the idea of a command is embodied in the <a href="#aomcommandnodes">command 
  nodes</a>. The application should be programmed to speak to the command nodes, 
  rather than directly to the widgets it expects, since commands can be worked 
  into different widgets after the program has been built.</p>
<h2>Command System Architecture</h2>
<p>An application's UI is specified with XML. This UI spec is parsed and built 
  into a content model accessible through the DOM. The UI spec unsurprisingly 
  includes visible components (widgets), but specifies the command system as well: 
  the network through which the components interact.</p>
<h3>Application DOM (or, the AOM)</h3>
<p>Specifically, the DOM built by Gecko in response to parsing a XUL UI description. 
  It contains both the command structure and the means of communicating commands 
  between widgets. </p>
<p>First, a short digression on UI instantiation from XUL and DOM. (This section 
  should be moved into a separate document and referenced from here.) The steps 
  of instantiating a UI from XUL are</p>
<ul>
  <li>An XML parser and content sink builds a DOM from XUL.</li>
  <li>Window creation code traverses the DOM, building the contents of the window, 
    which are layed out using Gecko. It expects to find XML elements and CSS directives 
    for displaying them. Some elements correspond to widgets, which are, to the 
    window instantiation code, atomic pieces of UI. Upon discovery of a widget 
    node in the DOM, the window creation code reserves a display rectangle, locates 
    and loads the corresponding widget code, and hands the DOM subtree to it so 
    it can finish initializing itself.</li>
  <li>Widgets are free to interpret their subtrees as they see fit: their contents 
    are specific to the widget and (ideally) invisible to the encompassing window.</li>
  <li>Any finishing touches necessary to establish necessary links between DOM 
    and window are performed. The authors expect some linkage between command 
    nodes and their corresponding originating widgets will need to be explicitly 
    established. Originating widgets will need to be event listeners for each 
    command node, so they will receive notification of attribute changes. This 
    part of the DOM event model is incomplete at time of writing, so the authors 
    are uncertain exactly how this functionality will be enabled. </li>
  <li>Once finished, a reference to the created (but still invisible) window is 
    returned to the caller, which may then do as it wishes with the window. (NB: 
    there will be methods like &quot;initialize&quot; and &quot;show&quot; in 
    the window API).</li>
</ul>
<p>The point of the above digression is that widget contents are <i>largely</i> 
  invisible to their environment; their contents being mostly private instructions 
  to specialized widget creation code. They are however expected to conform to 
  a standard mechanism by which originating and receiving widgets can be hooked 
  up by the window creation code.</p>
<p>Receiving widgets contain nodes describing the commands they can fulfill. Originating 
  widgets contain references to these commands, cloistered within a subtree with 
  a root element <code>commands</code>. Widget creation code must expect to find 
  a <code>commands</code> node in its tree, and ignore it and its children. The 
  Command System expects to find Command and Window Glue nodes in a flat hierarchy 
  under the <code>commands</code> node of receiving widgets. Note the entire subtree 
  specifying the widget is retained in the overall window DOM; it is available 
  for perusal by any code interested in the window structure (in this case, the 
  window loader, which is responsible for processing the mysterious <code>commands</code> 
  subtree).</p>
<h3><a name="aomcommandnodes"></a>Command Nodes in the AOM</h3>
<p>In the application UI description, structure is specified as well as visible 
  components themselves. This structure includes specific mention of commands, 
  in the same way as widgets are specified. For this reason, commands exist as 
  nodes in the AOM, just as do widgets.</p>
<p>Command Nodes embody the idea of a command to be executed by the application. 
  They are primarily the mechanism by which application code affects the state 
  of application commands. That is, any change an application wishes to make to 
  a command widget, such as disabling it, it should do by talking to the corresponding 
  command node. This ensures that all widgets which surface the command in question 
  are affected similarly.</p>
<p>A command node may also contain the actual code for executing the command. 
  Or more precisely, the <a href="#linkage">linking code</a> that causes the command 
  to be executed by the receiving widget. This paper specifies that command code 
  can be executed as either JavaScript or a call to a function compiled into the 
  application. This code can be found in either the originating widget, or the 
  corresponding command node.</p>
<p>There is another way the command could be executed as well. The application 
  shell could be programmed to receive all commands. It could then locate the 
  appropriate receiving widget for a command by stepping through some list of 
  widgets it maintains in the order of which one gets first crack at each incoming 
  command (a &quot;chain of command,&quot; if you like). Since this paper specifies 
  that Command Nodes inhabit a well-defined place within receiving widgets, the 
  application could determine whether each widget in its chain of command is a 
  suitable receptor by searching for the corresponding Command Node among its 
  descendants. Or of course it could pass the command to each candidate in turn, 
  expecting a return value signifying whether the command was handled.</p>
<p>These are merely suggestions. The command system architecture does not attempt 
  to specify exact handling of the command; only a standard framework for handling 
  them, which an application is free to interpret as it wishes.</p>
<p>Note the authors expect JavaScript event handlers specified in the widgets 
  to be handled directly by Gecko, but a mechanism for executing JavaScript in 
  a separate command node will need to be implemented, and this is a fragile point 
  in this spec. It is also unclear under which circumstances a command node's 
  handler would be used in preference to the originating widget's handler.</p>
<p>Command Nodes are nodes within the DOM tree. They directly correspond to no 
  visible element of the UI; they are merely abstract placeholders for commands. 
  A DOM command node is implemented as a subclass of the basic DOM node, the subclass 
  supporting a COM <a href="#nsicommand">nsICommand</a> interface. The interface 
  is expected to be little more than a set of convenience methods for setting 
  attributes of the node. For example, calling <code>SetEnable(true)</code> merely 
  sets the value of the <code>enabled</code> attribute.</p>
<p>The Command Architecture will rely on DOM notification events heralding a changed 
  attribute, sent to the node's event listeners. These event listeners are the 
  command originating widgets; the UI element(s) by which the command is surfaced. 
  Generally, that is, toolbar buttons or menu items. Therefore, command nodes 
  are the application's interface to commands: set a command node's attributes, 
  and all corresponding UI widgets will be messaged, and know that they must change 
  their appearance or behaviour accordingly.</p>
<h3>Window Glue Nodes</h3>
<p>These DOM nodes, along with Command Nodes, define the complete AOM Command 
  Model. They are a substitute for JavaScript event handlers; an alternate means 
  by which an originating widget can execute a command. They contain code which 
  is familiar with the DOM representing a particular window. They can then attach 
  event handlers explicitly to originating widgets, and route the commands as 
  they see fit.</p>
<p>This description obviously could apply equally well to a chunk of code compiled 
  directly into the application. Window Glue code is exactly that, except built 
  into a COM object, loadable at runtime, rather than directly into the application. 
  The reason for doing that is, as always, to separate the compiled application 
  from its scriptable UI description. A window's structure can be changed after 
  the application has been compiled. Window Glue Nodes are a place to put code 
  intimately familiar with the structure of a window, outside the application, 
  in a place where it can be specified alongside the window structure itself.</p>
<p>Window Glue Nodes are optional, and <a href="#windowgluecode">described</a> 
  within the linkage section. They are nodes within the DOM which support the 
  <a href="#nsiwindowglue"> <code>nsIWindowGlue</code></a> interface. They should 
  be ignored by the widget creation code. </p>
<h3>Originating Widgets in the AOM</h3>
<p>Originating widgets reference their command by name: a string mentioned in 
  the XUL UI spec. Command names must be unique within an application specification. 
  The authors expect to define a set of well-known command names and a Mozilla 
  command namespace.</p>
<p>When an Originating Widget must issue a command, perhaps in response to some 
  user action, it calls into a bit of linkage code. Being code, it will have a 
  great deal of freedom in what it wants to do. XPFE expect most commands to be 
  simple notifications such as the Window Glue <code>DoCommand(&quot;nscmd:openfile&quot;)</code> 
  or the JavaScript <code>doOpenFile()</code>. The <a href="#linkage">linkage 
  code</a> will be specified in this document, but the execution code, which is 
  expected to be hardwired directly into the target application, will not.</p>
<h3>Receiving Widgets in the AOM</h3>
<p> No explicit connection is made by the window creation code between commands 
  and their receiving widgets. Commands are carried out by arbitrary <a href="#linkage">linkage 
  code</a>, which may send the command anywhere it pleases.</p>
<p>Receiving Widgets; that is, widgets which wish to fulfill a command, should 
  contain command nodes in a <code>commands</code> subtree, whose root is a first-level 
  child of the widget content model. This relationship will be established in 
  the <a href="#xul">XUL</a> and carried through to the AOM. Strictly speaking, 
  this is (probably) not a requirement. XP Apps may wish to design their command 
  dispatching code to look for command nodes as it bubbles a command up through 
  the command chain, so such a requirement may come from them. However, XPFE believe 
  as a matter of style that command nodes representing each command a window can 
  process should be included as first-level children of all windows. Application 
  code will then have a well-known place to search for an interface to their command 
  structure.</p>
<p>XPFE expect the application shell will have a concept of a chain of command, 
  not specified by this document and indeed outside the scope of XPFE to specify. 
  Perhaps this chain of command begins at the widget which currently has focus. 
  Perhaps XPApps will simply expect all or most commands to be sent directly to 
  a place of central dispatch in the application (in which case, their command 
  nodes will be specified in XUL descendants of the application shell.) </p>
<h3><a name="linkage"></a>Command Linkage</h3>
<p>The originating widget or the corresponding command node are technically responsible 
  for carrying out a command, since they contain the first code in the sequence 
  of execution which ultimately fulfills the command. However, that code generally 
  should be nothing more than a function call. The receiving widget (or application) 
  is deemed responsible for actually carrying out the command. The specific response 
  to a command is outside the scope of this document. We are interested in the 
  means by which the originating widget carries notification of the command to 
  the receiving widget.</p>
<p>This linkage may be carried out in any of four fashions. All four are always 
  present and always operational; the application build and UI designer should 
  take care not to implement a command twice. The situation actually simplifies 
  in practice. Direct Application Code if present, should obviate the need for 
  any additional code. And Command Node code is really a cooperative thing with 
  the widget.</p>
<h4><a name="jsgluecode"></a>JavaScript</h4>
<p>JavaScript linkage requires COM Connect; a technology currently under development 
  within Gecko. The facility provided by COM Connect is planned to be a means 
  of dynamically adding a namespace containing methods and properties to individual 
  windows, reachable by JavaScript. (Note this capability currently exists and 
  is somewhat richer for DOM objects. The current state of COM Connect is one 
  where the DOM interface itself must be modified.) Once the framework has been 
  established, JavaScript code should be free to call methods unique to the receiving 
  widget.</p>
<p>Widgets can have event handlers, just as do form elements in HTML. The specific 
  events to which an originating widget responds are outside the scope of this 
  document; they are a subject for the specification of the individual widget. 
  Command Nodes can themselves contain JavaScript for processing the command using 
  the <code><a href="#commandnodexul">onCommand</a></code> attribute. Note this 
  method will probably require some cooperation from COM Connect and may prove 
  unfeasible, so the authors don't feel they can actually recommend its use. Still, 
  if possible, XPFE would like to provide a central place of code for fulfilling 
  a command within the command node itself, rather than distributed among the 
  individual widgets which surface the command. The widget would reference the 
  command node in its event handler. (Note: exact syntax to be determined later; 
  probably something like <code>onClick=&quot;commands.DoCommand()&quot;</code>.)</p>
<h4>Direct Application Code</h4>
Applications can of course directly contain linkage code. Linkage may be established 
by stepping through the DOM, searching for expected nodes by ID, and explicitly 
adding event listeners. The disadvantage of this approach is that the application 
must contain explicit knowledge of its UI, which it cannot do since the UI can 
be changed through XUL. For that reason, this method should never be used except 
in special cases such as algorithmically generated windows. Window Glue Code is 
a modification of Direct Application Code, designed to overcome this shortcoming 
for the general case. 
<h4><a name="windowgluecode"></a>Window Glue Code</h4>
<p>The code built into either a glue node or directly into the application can 
  be identical. Glue nodes merely provide a means by which the application at 
  large need not necessarily be built with intimate knowledge of its UI. Glue 
  nodes are specified along with the UI.</p>
<p>Glue nodes contain linkage code. XPFE expect them to be built as COM objects 
  in DLLs distributed along with the application and XUL. The <a href="#xul">UI 
  specification</a> will specify a GUID for an object supporting the <code><a href="nsiwindowglue">nsIWindowGlue</a></code> 
  interface, and the window loading code will create and instantiate the object 
  along with the window.</p>
<h4>Command Node Glue Code</h4>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#jsgluecode">JavaScript onCommand event handler</a> 
  mentioned above, the suggestion has been made that a command node should have 
  the capability to automatically execute a well-defined function in its parent 
  receiving widget. The authors are uncertain at this point how this should be 
  implemented. One possibility is that the parent window can choose to implement 
  the <a href="#nsireceivingwidget"><code>nsIReceivingWidget</code></a> interface. 
  The command node could use that interface and method, if available. This could 
  provide a means for specifying command linkage in the XUL file without additional 
  code, though it has the potential to break the design constraint calling for 
  the application not to have intimate knowledge of its UI, if used injudiciously.</p>
<h2><a name="xul"></a>XUL Command Specification</h2>
<p>The exact syntax has not been worked out yet, pending actually trying this 
  thing with code.</p>
<h3>Originating Widgets</h3>
<p>Originating widgets which wish to issue commands are specified as detailed 
  in their respective specifications (most of which don't exist at time of writing). 
  This document specifies merely that any originating widget which may be referenced 
  by the owning application in a generic, command-oriented way include a <code>cmd</code> 
  attribute, referencing a Command Element.</p>
<table border="1" width="100%" class="deftable">
  <tr> 
    <th>XML Element</th>
    <th colspan="2">Command Attribute</th>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td>menuitem, button (command widgets)</td>
    <td>cmd</td>
    <td>a string naming the command, referencing a corresponding command node</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Receiving Widgets</h3>
Receiving Widgets are widgets which expect to fulfill commands, and therefore, 
to receive notifications of commands to be executed, from originating widgets. 
Receiving Widgets are specified according to their individual specifications, 
listed <span class="unassigned">elsewhere</span>. The Command Architecture, however, 
adds to receiving widgets a <code>commands</code> subtree containing two types 
of children. This subtree should be ignored by the widget instantiation code. 
<h4><a name="commandnodexul"></a>Command Nodes</h4>
<p>Command Nodes must be first-level children of the <code>commands</code> node, 
  itself a first-level child of a receiving widget. The authors hope that receiving 
  widgets can be constrained to be top-level windows and applications. (Note this 
  restriction is placed to ease the task of finding command nodes.) Command Nodes 
  contain attributes controlling the status of the command, and consequently all 
  the originating widgets to which it corresponds.</p>

<p>These elements will be instantiated by the window builder code as DOM nodes 
  which support the <code><a href="#nsicommand">nsICommand</a></code> interface. 
</p>
<h4>Window Glue Nodes</h4>
<p>Window Glue Nodes are XUL specifications that the window building code must 
  satisfy by loading an object from a registry of COM objects (see the hands wave). 
  The object must support the <a href="#nsiwindowglue"><code>nsIWindowGlue</code></a> 
  interface and must be prepared to provide code accessible from an originating 
  widget which fulfills a command within the receiving widget.</p>

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>
<p>As an aside, the subject of convenience shortcuts has been raised. While this 
  is primarily an issue for individual widget developers, there is a need for 
  a standard set of shortcuts to which all originating widgets conform.</p>
<table border="1" width="100%" class="deftable">

<h3>nsIFrame </h3>
<p>XPFE expect all widgets to need to support the Gecko <code>nsIFrame</code> 
  interface. <code>nsIFrame</code> is a means for fitting into the Gecko layout 
  code, taking advantage of the Gecko environment. <code>nsIWidget</code> is a 
  means for constructing foreign (perhaps native) widgets, not tightly bound to 
  Gecko. In spite of the names, we expect our widgets to be Frame objects. Native 
  widget implementations will need to include an adapter layer that allows them 
  to fit into a Frame.</p>
<h3><a name="nsiwindowglue"></a>nsIWindowGlue</h3>
<p><code>nsIWindowGlue</code> is an interface which must be supported by DOM Window 
  Glue nodes. Its specification, too, will probably be moved into code. For now, 
  the authors present this swag to get things started.</p>
<code> 
<pre>class nsIWindowGlue : public nsISupports {
public:
  NS_IMETHOD Create(const nsIFrame *aParent);
  NS_IMETHOD Destroy();
  NS_IMETHOD Initialize();
  NS_IMETHOD GetParent(nsIFrame **aParent) const;
  virtual NS_IMETHOD DoCommand(const nsString &amp;aCmdName);
}</pre>
</code> Actual Window Glue objects must probably be subclasses of <code>nsIWindowGlue</code>, 
and define their own unique methods for executing commands. Originating Widgets 
must be able to call unique methods by name (such as <code>LoadURL</code>), and 
be able to add arbitrary parameters to <code>DoCommand</code>, if that method 
is used. 
<h3><a name="nsicommand"></a>nsICommand</h3>
<p><code>nsICommand</code> is the interface which all DOM command nodes must support. 
  It is a generic means of accessing attributes of a command, as explained in 
  the body of this document. A Command Node is expected to be nothing more than 
  a DOM node containing attributes of interest to originating widgets. The <code>nsICommand</code> 
  interface is expected to be nothing more than convenience functions for setting 
  node attribute values. Any change in an attribute value is broadcast by the 
  underlying DOM event mechanism to the node's originating widgets. As with the 
  other interfaces, its specification will probably be moved into code. For now, 
  more swag.</p>
<code>
<pre>class nsICommand : public nsISupports {
public:
  NS_IMETHOD Create();
  NS_IMETHOD Destroy();
  NS_IMETHOD GetName(nsString &amp;aName) const;
  NS_IMETHOD AddOriginatingWidget(const nsIFrame *aWidget);
  NS_IMETHOD RemoveOriginatingWidget(nsIFrame *aWidget);
  NS_IMETHOD SetEnabled(PRBool aEnabled);
  NS_IMETHOD GetEnabled(PRBool *aEnabled) const;
  NS_IMETHOD SetSelected(PRBool aSelected);
  NS_IMETHOD GetSelected(PRBool *aSelected) const;
  NS_IMETHOD SetTooltip(const nsString &amp;aTip);
  NS_IMETHOD GetTooltip(nsString &amp;aTip) const;
  NS_IMETHOD SetDescription(const nsString &amp;aDescription);
  NS_IMETHOD GetDescription(nsString &amp;aDescription) const;
}</pre></code>
<p><code> </code>(And, as mentioned above, the question remains, should we include 
  text and icon sets, attributes which we feel should be specified in style sheets?) 
</p>
<h3><a name="nsireceivingwidget"></a>nsIReceivingWidget</h3>
<p>In this version of this document, this interface is optional. If the parent 
  of a Command Node supports this interface, the command node will call its one 
  method, passing as the parameter the value of the command node's <code>name</code> 
  attribute, when the command should be executed. This may be a means of automatically 
  executing simple commands without the burden of writing explicit linking code 
  in the XUL.</p>
<code>
<pre>class nsIReceivingWidget : public nsISupports {
public:
  virtual NS_IMETHOD DoCommand(nsString &amp;aCommandName);
}</pre>
</code>
<h2>XUL Example</h2>
<p>Following is a very weak example which the authors hope may help explain the 
  concepts in this paper. A better example, more clearly explained, will replace 
  this one in a later revision. For now, we describe a dialog. Note the specifics 
  of the dialog specification should not be taken literally; the items of interest 
  here are the ones specific to command issues, as described in this document. 
  This example is intended to illustrate these points</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple widgets need not be part of the command structure at all. The &quot;see 
    this?&quot; checkbox, for instance, is assumed to have no effect on any declared 
    status of the application or dialog. It would be initialized along with the 
    dialog and then queried after the dialog has been closed.</li>
  <li>Command linkage code can be either JavaScript or application source code, 
    and they can probably coexist. The authors feel the application source code 
    version is best relegated to a COM object.</li>
  <li>Command linkage code is often best local to a window or widget set, rather 
    than global to the application. The Window Glue in this example is assumed 
    to contain C code which runs the dialog widgets (except for those containing 
    JavaScript event handlers).</li>
  <li>Simple interactions between widgets within a local environment such as a 
    dialog need not declare command objects; they can simply affect each other 
    directly. The Window Glue is again assumed to contain code which enables or 
    disables directly (using the DOM, not the widget itself) the OK button in 
    response to the state of the &quot;allow OK&quot; checkbox (which is, again, 
    a strange way to do things.)</li>
  <li>Widgets can affect the state of commands within their environment. Again, 
    the magic Window Glue is assumed to contain code which locates within the 
    overall AOM the <code>nscmd:stomp</code> node and set its enabled state to 
    follow the value of the &quot;allow stompage&quot; checkbox.</li>
</ul>
<p>This (incomplete and possibly inaccurate regarding attributes specific to individual 
  widgets) XUL specification declares an application window and a dialog window. 
  The application is prepared to respond to <code>nscmd:stomp</code> commands. 
  The dialog contains a checkbox which (unwisely) immediately affects the state 
  of the application <code>nscmd:stomp</code> command. A real dialog wouldn't 
  work this way, of course. The example is built so to demonstrate the internal 
  workings of a widget which does affect the state of an application command. 
  In this case, the dialog is an originating widget.</p>
<p>The <code>windowglue</code> code presumably contains C code which links itself 
  into the DOM corresponding to the dialog, sets itself up as a listener of the 
  &quot;allow OK&quot; checkbox, and enables or disables the OK button to follow 
  suit. Window Glue objects, being code, are free to do anything they wish. The 
  &quot;see this&quot; checkbox presumably has no special event handling code 
  at all; its status can be queried by the calling application after the dialog 
  has finished, if the application is interested.</p>
<code>
<pre>&lt;!-- main application window --&gt;
&lt;window title=&quot;Application&quot;&gt;
&lt;menubar ...&gt;
  &lt;menu ...&gt;
    &lt;menuitem cmd=&quot;nscmd:stomp&quot; .../&gt;
  &lt;/menu&gt;
&lt;/menubar&gt;
&lt;toolbar ...&gt;
  &lt;button cmd=&quot;nscmd:stomp&quot; .../&gt;
&lt;/toolbar&gt;
&lt;commands&gt;
  &lt;command name=&quot;nscmd:stomp&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;!-- other parameters of command are assumed to have
    some useful initial value --&gt;
&lt;/commands&gt;
&lt; ... more useful content ... &gt;
&lt;/window&gt;

&lt;!-- dialog --&gt;
&lt;window id=&quot;overwrite&quot; title=&quot;Overwrite File?&quot;&gt;
  &lt;commands&gt;
    &lt;windowglue
      cid=&quot;f7f7f7f7-7f7f-f7f7-7f7f-f7f7f7f7f7f7&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/commands&gt;

  Are you entirely certain, or completely daffy?
  &lt;checkbox id=&quot;seethis&quot; title=&quot;See this?&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;checkbox id=&quot;allowstompage&quot; title=&quot;Enable Stompage?&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;checkbox id=&quot;allow&quot; title=&quot;Allow exit&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;button onClick=&quot;opener.doDialogOK('overwrite')&quot;&gt;OK&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button onClick=&quot;opener.doDialogCancel('overwrite')&quot;&gt;
    Cancel&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/window&gt;</pre>
</code> 
<h2>Unresolved Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Does it make sense to declare a JavaScript hierarchy for getting to command 
    nodes, so a click handler like <code>onClick = &quot;application.commands.nscmdstomp.SetEnabled(false)</code>&quot; 
    ? (This is not trivially done: there is no direct support for this in JavaScript.)</li>
  <li>Should Command Nodes be the interface by which the application sets a command's 
    UI elements, such as the icon? (Inapplicable attributes would be ignored by 
    widget implementations.) If so, these are probably attributes which should 
    be specified by style sheet, and we need to figure out that whole story before 
    we can even try to relegate that data to the command node.</li>
</ul>
<p>And from the Suggestion Box:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Originating Widgets may want the ability to specify a default target in 
    their XUL.</li>
  <li>The example wants to be less contrived, and probably wants diagrams including 
    the resulting content model and flow-of-control.</li>
</ul>
