<h2>
XPToolkit : Straight-up Elevator Story:</h2>
The XPToolkit is an open source SDK for building common cross-platform
user interfaces using existing cross-platform standards (e.g., XML, RDF,
HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript) and technologies (e.g., Gecko, XPConnect) to
minimize platform-specific code, and therefore time to market. We want
to provide for massively parallel development of XP UI.&nbsp; We are particularly
focussed on building widgets and services to support the common needs of
the mozilla browser, editor and mail/news apps.
<p>We are providing for intermixing of native dialogs and widgets, but
we aren't trying to trying to be the Alpha and Omega of UI toolkits.&nbsp;
In particular, we currently have no plans to do widgets that aren't universally
needed (like Date/Time pickers).&nbsp; We aren't trying to provide for
writing the most Mac-like Windows-like or Linux-like (whatever that means)
applications; for that you'll probably always have to go native. The platforms
we are committed to shipping on are Linux,&nbsp; MacPPC and Win32; but
we have an internal need for Solaris in order to do Purify builds.
