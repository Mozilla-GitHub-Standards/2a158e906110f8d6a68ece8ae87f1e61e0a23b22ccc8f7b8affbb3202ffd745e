<h1><a name="posedialog"></a>Dialog Posing API</h1>

<p>some investigation, some new code, some grunge.</p>

<p>This section describes changes we need to make to code which poses
dialogs to ready it for use as an embeddable browser. It begins with history
and explanation, but hurried programmers may want to skip ahead to the
<a href="#programmingnotes">programming notes</a> section.</p>

<p>It seems generally accepted that embedding apps need to be able to
request that Gecko pose one of its dialogs, and that they be able to replace
any of Gecko's dialogs with their own. Note that in this Dialog Posing
Section, an embedded context is the same as an installation context, meaning
that the problem and solution are the same for an application wishing to
embed a Gecko browser, and for a customized installation of the Mozilla
browser.</p>

<p>To pose a dialog, Mozilla code generally simply calls window.open (or the
C++ equivalent) directly.  We plan to substitute dialog-posing components
which can be swapped out by emdedder's components. A few scattered groups
have already begun to architect their UIs this way; we're just building on
it and canonizing it.</p>

<p>An earlier plan was to roll all dialog posing methods into a single
generic interface. We have abandoned the generic thrust and now plan a
collection of individual components. Code that needs to present one or
several dialogs and could be called from an embedded Gecko browser must
collect its dialog posing code into a special-purpose interface, built into
a component. The dialog posing interface for each component is free to be
unique to that component, since we've abandoned as impractical the effort to
standardize this thing. (Though see a restriction under
<a href="#dialogparentage">Dialog Parentage</a>).</p>

<p>We are explicitly omitting dialogs which wouldn't appear in an embedded
browser. For example Composer's Image Properties Dialog isn't included, but
the nsIPrompt alerts are. One of our
<a href="#posedialogtasks">tasks</a> in coding this will be to make an
exhaustive list of all affected dialogs. But this document includes a
preliminary list of <a href="#posedialogcomponents">likely dialog-serving
components</a>, presented as a guide, not a mandate.</p>

<p>The point behind all this work is to make all dialogs pluggable. An
embedding application will have detailed knowledge on which dialogs can be
posed by an embedded browser, and can at its discretion override any or all
of them. To replace a dialog by one of its own; that is, to force Gecko to
display a dialog of their construction rather than Mozilla's, the embedding
application must install its own version of the dialog-serving component.
Embedded Gecko (or the full Mozilla app) will preferentially use that
component when it runs into code that uses one of these dialog-serving APIs
to pose a dialog. This goal implies a few additional architectural changes,
described in the remainder of this section.</p>

<h2>Architectural Changes</h2>

<h3><a name="dialogparentage"></a>Dialog Parentage</h3>

<p>Dialogs generally must be attached to their parent window in some
fashion, to appease OSes with window-modal dialogs (as opposed to
application-modal). Currently the Mozilla codebase addresses this in one
of three ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code initiating network access (one of our biggest users of dialogs)
      stashes a parent window in the channel, in some disguised form.</li>
  <li>Dialogs are opened directly from the parent window, as in the
      JavaScript <code>window.open</code>.</li>
  <li>The dialog is posed without a parent and allowed to wreak havoc.</li>
</ul>

<p>This document doesn't address the third case, which luckily is relatively
rare. The first two cases must adapt under this plan. The solution isn't as
complex as the problem's description. Each method which poses a dialog in a
component's interface must take an nsIDOMWindow parent parameter. The
objects currently used to parent dialogs in the first two cases above can
readily cough up an nsIDOMWindow, so we shouldn't need to add to the list of
dialogs in the third category.</p>

<h3><a name="downcalls"></a>Data Transfer Methods</h3>

<p>While some dialogs are posed solely from within the browser, others are
posed directly by the owning application. Preferences, for instance. For the
embedding application to write its own interface, these dialogs must
provide, in addition to methods to pose the dialog, methods to populate the
dialog from Gecko data and methods to push changed data from the dialog back
into Gecko. Preferences, for instance, has <code>nsIPref</code>. Other such
dialogs will need similar access.</p>

<h3><a name="piecemealoverride"></a>Piecemeal Overriding of Dialogs</h3>

<p>Some of the dialog UI components may be large and complex. The people
behind this document have nevertheless agreed that it will be acceptable if,
to override one dialog, an embedding application or installation must write
its own implementation of the complete interface. However, we believe a
scheme for overriding only certain methods within a component is desirable
and way more slick, and we spec a simple way for complex UI components to be
able to support this capability.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether an individual component chooses to support this
capability, all dialog-posing code must be prepared for the existence of two
components implementing each UI-posing interface: the default Mozilla
version and an embedding application's override version. That constrains
dialog-posing code to never pose dialogs directly, but always go through the
correct UI component. Additionally, complex UI components should allow an
embedding app to override only a subset of all their dialogs, as outlined in
the <a href="#guidelines">guidelines</a> section.</p>

<p>There still remains the issue of whether we will support possible
multiple applications each sharing a single instance of a Mozilla
installation. While there may be issues preventing that, the dialog posing
scheme outlined here should be able to handle it by enforcing a convention
that, while the default Mozilla implementations may be automatically
registered components, the application override implementations must be
individually registered with the component manager at startup each time the
application launches, and that registration is not to be persistent across
subsequent launches of the application.</p>

<h2><a name="programmingnotes"></a>Programming Notes</h2>

<h3>Dialogs posed by the embedded browser ("up calls")</h3>

<p>Any component which may be included in an embedded browser distribution
and wishes to pose a dialog must group its UI (code which runs its dialogs)
into a unique interface built just for that purpose. Any such code which
isn't already a component needs to be. All code which actually poses
dialogs, if it does this directly using <code>window.open</code>, wants to
be changed to go through the new interface.</p>

<p>Note that nsIPrompt dialogs will be one such component, so a component
whose UI solely uses nsIPrompt is already up to spec.</p>

<h3>Dialogs posed by the embedding app ("down calls")</h3>

<p>Some components will not pose dialogs directly, but maintain a database
of information an embedding app may wish to display as a dialog. Preferences
are the canonical example. In this case, we must be sure to have an API
which an embedding app can use to populate its own dialog, should it decide
to eschew Mozilla's XUL version. These components need build no dialog
posing interface.</p>

<h3><a name="guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h3>

<p>A few restrictions on each component's UI interface (yes I know...).
Most if not all of these dialogs will need to be child/dependent/transient
windows, so each method responsible for actually opening a window must take
an <code>nsIDOMWindow *aParent</code> parameter, and use that window as the
dialog's parent, if non-null.</p>

<p>In some cases, we want to allow an overriding implementation to be able
to implement only certain dialogs within a component, rather than being
forced to implement them all. Most of the burden is on the embedding
application, but a Gecko dialog-posing component needs to do a little extra
work.</p>

<p>Not all components need to worry about this. The benefit of supporting
this capability is kind of unremarkable for a small, simple component.
Complex components for which this capability makes sense (we leave this to
the judgment of the component author!) should go to a little extra effort to
allow an overriding implementation to override it piecemeal.</p>

<p>A complex dialog-posing component should register itself with two
Contract IDs, both referring to the same interface and implementation. Both
will be published as part of Gecko's embedding API, though one is "public"
and one "private". (Really, "basic" and "overrideable".) All UI components
may be overridden by an embedding application or peculiar installation which
may, at its discretion, register its own version of each UI component with
the Component Manager at startup. Within complex components, we would also
like for them to be able to override single dialogs. The scheme is for the
default Gecko components to respond equally to two Contract IDs, and for the
overriding component (if any) to override only the overrideable version. The
overriding component will include its own implementation for each method it
wishes to override, and it will be responsible for calling through to the
base Gecko interface for each method it wishes to leave alone.</p>

<p>To make our embedding API as consistent as possible, we'd like to impose
a few coding conventions on these dialog-posing interfaces. We'll
probably add more in time, but for now, here's the complete list:</p>

<p>Embedded dialog posing interface coding conventions</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <code>nsIDOMWindow *aParent</code> parameter mentioned above
      should be the first parameter to each method in which it appears.</li>
  <li>The "private" Contract ID mentioned above should have the form,
      ohhh, let's say "@mozilla.org/embedui/<b>unique-component-name</b>;1"
      (where the ";1" will presumably change in the future) and the
      "public" one
      "@mozilla.org/embedui/<b>unique-component-name</b>-override;1"</li>
</ul>

<p>We wish we had actual code examples. The idea is straightforward;
hopefully that will be enough for now, as we're just getting started. PSM 2
is headed this way. You may want to look in mozilla/security/manager/pki
for ideas.</p>

<p>We have been building a list of affected components, currently arranged
as a series of approximations converging on a final list; attachments to

<h1><a name="sanctifypromptservice"></a>Sanctify nsIPromptService</h1>

<p>new code</p>

<p>It seems that for practical reasons we'll never successfully fit a window
context into all the places that initiate a channel. (See the issue of
<a href="#dialogparentage">Dialog Parentage</a>.) So rather than try to
force the issue, the plan is to make nsIPromptService work in an embedding
context. Standing in the way is nsIPromptService's use of the Evil Hidden
Window; an object present only in the Mozilla application. It uses Hidden
Window to open a new window (because before the recent ability to
<a href="#openwindows">open windows without a parent</a>, windows couldn't
be created in the absence of an extant window to serve as their parent). But
we should now be able to fix nsIPromptService to work in an embedded
context.  Windows created through this mechanism will still misbehave:
they'll fail to be modal to their parent (important on platforms where modal
windows are window modal, not application modal). That's unfortunate, but we
have no solution at this time.</p>

<h2>nsIPromptService sanctification tasks</h2>
<ol start=1 type=1>
  <li>Replace usage of Hidden Window in nsCommonDialogs with the
      <code><a href="#openwindows">Window Watcher</a></code>.</li>
  <li>Move the component containing it out of <code>xpfe</code>, into a
      component more likely to be included in an embedding
      distribution.</li>
</ol>

<h1><a name="eventloop"></a>The Event Loop</h1>

<p>documentation</p>

<p>The issue here is how the embedding app and Gecko will cooperate to
implement modality, and what repercussions this will have on both.
A modal dialog must do two unique things (ooo, a list:)</p>

<ol>
  <li>lock out user interaction with other windows (or at least the
      parent window, depending on the platform)</li>
  <li>prevent the calling code from continuing until the dialog is dismissed,
      without losing important events</li>
</ol>

<p>People seem to be agreeing that we need not worry about the modal event
loop in an embedded Mozilla, for reasons spelled out in an older version of
this document. Basically it becomes an absurd exercise for Gecko to even try
to provide a workable captive event loop suitable for use in foreign
applications. Our current chosen direction is one where the application
provides its own support for modality, and we must merely document this.</p>

<p>Note that this makes the task of showing an alert (like
nsIPrompt::Alert()) potentially more complicated to the calling application
than merely calling the function. That's unfortunate, but I think our
options are limited. Note also that nsIPrompt functions may not be at issue,
if they are implemented by the embedding app as a naturally modal system
dialog (like Windows' MessageBox), as entertained in the
<a href="#nsiprompt">nsIPrompt</a> section. This decision may affect only
other, rarer dialogs which the embedding application may want to be
modal.</p>

<i>Tasks from the previous version of this document, now implemented
or abandoned:</i>

<h1><a name="openwindows"></a>Open Windows Without an nsXULWindow</h1>

<p>Implemented. The new nsIWindowWatcher service contains a public method,
<code>OpenWindow</code>. This is the supported way to create a window
without a parent (by passing <code>null</code> in the <code>aParent</code>
parameter).</p>

<p>For this to work, the owning application must conform to two
requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each application must instantiate an instance of an
    <code>nsIWindowCreator</code>, and let the Window Watcher hold on to
    it by calling <code>nsIWindowWatcher::SetWindowCreator</code>.</li>
  <li>In the application, each object implementing
    <code>nsIWebBrowserChrome</code> must be able to cough up an
    <code>nsIDOMWindow</code> in its
    <code>nsIInterfaceRequestor::GetInterface</code> method.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="windowmediator"></a>Window Mediator Component</h1>

<p>Implemented. It's the <code>nsIWindowWatcher</code> component.</p> This
service generally requires no new maintenance from embedding applications;
it's hooked in at a Mozilla code level. Embedding applications are required
to maintain its <code>activeWindow</code> attribute (by setting it when the
active window changes), though truth be told, in the current codebase, the
attribute is never used.</p>

<h1><a name="nsiprompt"></a>Augment nsIPrompt</h1>

<p>Current status: while the points below remain a concern, we've decided
to generally leave <code>nsIPrompt</code> alone, except its implementation,
as discussed in the <a href="#posedialog">dialog posing API</a> section.</p>

<p>All dialogs should be children of some owning window. Otherwise, at best
there can be confusion about which browser window (for example) a dialog
belongs to. At worst a modal alert will be unable to lock out user
interaction with the parent window. The worst case causes programmer
surprises and occasional crashes. We must be able to retrieve a suitable
parent window any time we wish to pose a dialog.</p>

<p>Two possible schemes for accomplishing this have been raised.  These are:
an augmentation to our current scheme in which references to the top-level
window are carried around in contexts which may conceivably want to pose a
dialog, and a global service which can be trusted to always hold a reference
to the window corresponding to the network access currently being processed.
These were both discussed in an earlier version of this document. In this
one I'm running with the conclusion, which was that we stick with our
current nsIPrompt scheme. Both schemes have their hoary undersides. Suffice
to say that even the more general sounding other solution doesn't work in
all situations which already occur in the codebase.</p>

<p>Mozilla's current standard way of knowing the correct parent for a dialog
relies on the code which initiates a networking connection (at some early
point, every operation can locate its correct window) to stash a reference
to the top-level window, disguised as an nsIInterfaceRequestor, in the
channel. All current uses of this object QI it to an nsIPrompt. This holds
for both Mozilla-the-app and for our embedding windows, as currently
specified.</p>

<p>The fact that all top-level windows, both Mozilla and embedding, already
must implement nsIPrompt takes care of our immediate problem of moving
nsIPrompt into the embedding world. Arguably, we're done with that (though
I'll propose an extension requested by some outside developers, but that
isn't immediately necessary.) What's left is the ability to pose a few more
complicated dialogs. There's a move on to simplify nsIPrompt, to make the
task of implementing this basic UI more straightforward for embedding apps.
This may end up being a bootless simplification because of modifications
described in the <a href="#posedialog">dialog posing API</a> section.</p>

<h1><a name="nsipromptservice"></a>Exorcise nsIPromptService</h1>

<p>Current status: while the points below remain a concern, we've switched
our tack and decided instead to
<a href="#sanctifypromptservice">Sanctify nsIPromptService</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#nsiprompt">nsIPrompt soliloquy</a> I mentioned that current
accepted behaviour is to stash an nsIPrompt in each networking access' channel,
from where it can be retrieved by code which does not naturally belong to
a window but wishes to pose a dialog (like network error alerts). This is done
in nearly all cases, but it's still wise to code a fallback in the dialog
posing code.</p>

<p>The dialog posing code attempts to retrieve an nsIPrompt from the
nsIChannel. Failing that, it uses the global nsIPromptService. That creates
a window whose parent is Hidden Window. It nearly works in the application,
but the alert is incorrectly parented and behaves badly (on systems for
which modal windows are modal only to their parent, it neglects to lock out
user interaction with the parent window, leading to possible crashes). And
it doesn't work in the embedding case, since there is no Hidden Window
there.</p>

<p>It's important for this scheme to work that each piece of code that
initiates a channel hook it up with a proper nsIPrompt. Unfortunately, each
such place in the code is rather unique. Most do; a few do not. A typical,
or at least likely case, is the first load that happens when a browser
window begins loading a web page. That load is fired by an nsDocShell. The
nsDocShell has access to the nsIPrompt corresponding to its top-level
window, and happily hands that along as an nsIPrompt. That one's relatively
easy.<p>

<p>The Channel doesn't carry an nsIPrompt directly; it contains an
nsIInterfaceRequestor, accessible through its GetNotificationCallbacks
method. If the channel's creator was thoughtful enough to put an nsIPrompt
in that nsIInterfaceRequestor slot, you can request an nsIPrompt from that,
and this is the common pattern in Mozilla. Occasionally the initiator
doesn't put an nsIPrompt in the channel, but something else instead (last I
looked, imglib was doing this somewhere). That causes problems in the
current code and wants to be fixed. We need to do something like ... urk ...
teach the channel to hold a list of notification callbacks and cycle through
them each time.</p>

<h2>tasks to exorcise nsIPromptService</h2>

<ol start=1 type=1>
  <li>Teach our nsChannel to be able to hold more than one
      nsIInterfaceRequestor, and its users to be able to deal with
      more than one.</li>
  <li>Locate all places where a channel is initiated. Most already
      associate an nsIPrompt with the channel. Those that don't.
      should also add an nsIPrompt.</li>
  <li>Remove the global service fallbacks relied on by distrustful
      end consumers.</li>
  <li>Remove the global service.</li>
