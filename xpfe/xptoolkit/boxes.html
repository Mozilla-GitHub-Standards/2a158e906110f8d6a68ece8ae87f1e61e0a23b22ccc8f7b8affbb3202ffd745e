 <p class="remark">This spec is my own
  interpretation of how boxes work. If I'm wrong about
  anything, please bring it to my attention. You may have
  discovered a bug in boxes, or I may have misinterpreted
  something. - Dave
 <h2>The Basics</h2>
 <p>The box is a special kind of container used primarily for
  laying out controls within dialogs and windows. Boxes lay
  out their children using a constraint-based system in which
  both relative sizing and intrinsic sizing of controls are
  supported. Boxes are ideal for a layout in which the size of
  the controls could change (e.g., because of localization
  changes or skin changes).
 <p>The box is specified using the
  <code>box</code> element. Boxes come in two
  flavors: the horizontal box and the vertical box. The
  horizontal box lays out its children horizontally (left to
  right), and the vertical box stacks its children vertically
  (top to bottom).
 <p>The <code>align</code> attribute can be
  used to dictate whether or not the box is horizontal or
  vertical. If the <code>align</code>
  attribute is omitted, the box is assumed to be
  horizontal.
 <pre class="code">&lt;box align="horizontal"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Child 1"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Child 2"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;</pre>
 <div class="figure"><img src="boxes/box1.gif" alt="Code shown above rendered."></div>
 <p>When items are placed in a box without specifying any
  additional information about their size, then the box will
  flow the children <em>intrinsically</em>. In other words, the
  box will ask each child how big its needs to be, and then it
  will make the child that size. Notice that in the above
  example, the two buttons are only as big as they need to be
  to display all of their text.
 <p>Widths can be specified for items inside a horizontal
  box. When an object specifies its width in pixels or in ems,
  it is telling the box that it would like to be that width.
  Percentage widths are meaningless inside a horizontal box.
  Similarly, heights can be specified for items in a vertical
  box. The component is indicating its preferred height.
  Percentage heights are likewise meaningless inside a
  vertical box.
 <p>It is generally the case that specifying percentage
  widths or heights on children of a box (regardless of its
  alignment) is meaningless and should be avoided.
  <span class="remark">In fact, it currently appears
  that such a specification can cause problems, so make sure
  that if you're using boxes, you don't use percentage widths
  and heights on the direct children of the
  box.</span>
 <pre class="code">&lt;box&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton style="width: 200px" value="Child 1"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton style="width: 100px" value="Child 2"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;</pre>
 <div class="figure"><img src="boxes/box2.gif" alt="Code shown above rendered."></div>
 <p>In the above example, the first child is twice as wide as
  the second child, since it asked to be 200 pixels wide. The
  second child asked to be only 100 pixels wide.
 <h2>Flex</h2>
 <p>Objects in boxes fall into two categories:
  <dfn>flexible</dfn> and <dfn>inflexible</dfn>. Inflexible objects
  will not grow, even when there is extra space left over in
  the box.
 <pre class="code">&lt;box style="width: 400px;"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton style="width: 200px" value="Child 1"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton style="width: 100px" value="Child 2"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;</pre>
 <div class="figure"><img src="boxes/box3.gif" alt="Code shown above rendered."></div>
 <p>By default all objects in a horizontal box are the same
  height, that of the tallest child in the box. In a vertical
  box, by default, all objects are the same width, that of the
  widest child in the box.
 <pre class="code">&lt;box align="vertical"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Cat"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Piranha"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Antidisestablishmentarianism"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;</pre>
 <div class="figure"><img src="boxes/box4.gif" alt="Code shown above rendered."></div>
 <p>An object becomes flexible when the
  <code>flex</code> attribute is placed on the
  element. Objects that are flexible can shrink or grow as the
  box shrinks and grows. Whenever there is extra space left
  over in a box, the flexible objects are expanded to fill
  that space. Flex is specified as a numerical value. All flex
  is relative. For example, a child with a flex of 2 is twice
  as flexible as a child with a flex of 1.
 <p>Let's take a look at what happens with flexible objects
  when there is extra space left over.
 <pre class="code">&lt;box align="vertical" style="height: 200px"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Cat"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton flex="1" value="Piranha"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Antidisestablishmentarianism"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;</pre>
 <div class="figure"><img src="boxes/box5.gif" alt="Code shown above rendered."></div>
 <p>In the above example, the box is 200 pixels tall, which
  is more than enough room for the three buttons. Because the
  first and third buttons are inflexible, they remain the same
  size as in the previous example. The second button is
  specified as being flexible, and because it is the only
  flexible object in the box, it receives all of the extra
  space.
 <p>When several objects in a box are flexible, the extra
  space is divided among the objects based on how flexible
  they are. The box determines how much space to give an
  object by adding up the flex values on all of its children.
  An object gets an amount of extra space equal to the
  percentage of flex that it is responsible for.
 <p>For example, if two objects have a flex of 1, then the
  first object gets 1/(1+1) = 1/2 of the extra space, and the
  second object also gets 1/2 of the extra space.
 <pre class="code">&lt;box align="vertical"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton flex="1" value="Cat"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton flex="1" value="Piranha"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;</pre>
 <div class="figure"><img src="boxes/box6.gif" alt="Code shown above rendered."></div>
 <p>Here is another example using objects with different flex
  values.
 <pre class="code">&lt;box align="vertical"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton flex="1" value="Cat"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton flex="2" value="Piranha"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton flex="3" value="Canary"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;</pre>
 <div class="figure"><img src="boxes/box7.gif" alt="Code shown above rendered."></div>
 <h2>Preferred, Minimum, and Maximum Sizes</h2>
 <p>For inflexible objects, the specification of the
  <code>width</code> and
  <code>height</code> properties can be used
  to hardcode an object's size. If they are omitted, an
  inflexible object will be sized intrinsically.
 <p>With flexible objects, there are more options. Just as
  with inflexible objects, the
  <code>width</code> and
  <code>height</code> properties can be used
  to specify a preferred size. However, unlike inflexible
  objects, this size is only a guideline. The box code will
  stretch a flexible object as it sees fit. It will also
  shrink the object if required until the object can shrink no
  more (e.g., when the object hits its minimum required
  intrinsic size).
 <pre class="code">&lt;box align="vertical"&gt;
	 &lt;titledbutton flex="1" style="height:1000px" value="Cat"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;</pre>
 <div class="figure"><img src="boxes/box8.gif" alt="Code shown above rendered."></div>
 <div class="figure"><img src="boxes/box9.gif" alt="Code shown above rendered."></div>
 <p>In the above example the box is shrinking, and despite
  the specification of 1000 pixels as the preferred height,
  the button, because it is flexible, shrinks with the box. It
  continues to shrink until the minimum required height for
  the button is reached. After that, the button can shrink no
  further. If the box were to continue to shrink, the button's
  contents would be clipped, and a portion of the button would
  no longer be visible.
 <p>Components can therefore have their own notions of
  minimum and maximum intrinsic sizes. For example, the titled
  button was smart enough to know that it could not get any
  smaller than the minimum height required to draw its borders
  and its text.
 <p>For a more fine-grained control of minimum and maximum
  sizes, the <code>min-width</code>,
  <code>min-height</code>,
  <code>max-width</code>, and
  <code>max-height</code> properties can be
  used. When specified, they provide extra information to the
  box as it shrinks and grows the object in question.
 <p>In a horizontal box, for example, if a minimum width is
  specified, then the flexible object will not be allowed to
  shrink below that width. If a maximum width is specified,
  then the flexible object will not be allowed to grow beyond
  that width.
 <pre class="code">
&lt;box align="vertical"&gt;
  &lt;html:iframe flex="1" style="min-height:100px; max-height:300px; width:300px"
  src="http://www.mozillazine.org/"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;</pre>
 <div class="figure"><img src="boxes/box10.jpg" alt="Code shown above rendered."></div>
 <div class="figure"><img src="boxes/box11.jpg" alt="Code shown above rendered."></div>
 <p>In the above example you can see
  <code>min-height</code> and
  <code>max-height</code> in action. In the
  first screenshot the box has been shrunk until it is smaller
  than 100 pixels in height. Because the iframe has a
  specified minimum height of 100 pixels, it is not allowed to
  shrink any further, and so as the box falls below 100
  pixels, the iframe gets clipped, and portions of it become
  invisible.
 <p>In the second screenshot, the box has been expanded past
  300 pixels in height. Even though the box is getting bigger,
  the extra space is not being consumed by the iframe, because
  its maximum height of 300 pixels has been reached. It will
  grow no further.
 <p>Below is another example illustrating min and max
         width.
 <pre class="code">
&lt;box align="horizontal"&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Child 1" flex="100%" style="max-width: 50px"/&gt;
     &lt;titledbutton value="Child 2" flex="100%" style="min-width: 50px"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;</pre>
 <div class="figure"><img src="boxes/box12.gif" alt="Code shown above rendered."></div>
 <p>In the above example, the box has been stretched so that
  it is very wide. The first child has a maximum width of 50
  pixels, and it divides the excess space equally with the
  second child until its maximum width has been reached. After
  that, since it is not allowed to grow any further, the
  remaining space all goes to the second child.
 <h2>Nesting Boxes</h2>
 <p>It may help to remember that regardless of the kind of
  child you place inside a box, the above basic rules continue
  to apply. When a box is placed inside another box, it's no
  different than placing anything else inside the box. Like
  any other children of a box, a nested box is either flexible
  or inflexible. When inflexible it will size itself
  intrinsically if no widths or heights are specified on it.
  If the size is specified on an inflexible child, the child
  box will be that size.
 <p>The whole concept of boxes is that they are a very simple
  atomic layout managers. By themselves that are not that
  powerful but when nested you can achieve some complex
  layouts. Take this example.
 <pre class="code">
&lt;box align="horizontal"&gt;
  &lt;spring flex="1"/&gt;
  &lt;box align="vertical"&gt;
    &lt;spring flex="1"/&gt;
    &lt;titledbutton value="centered"/&gt;
    &lt;spring flex="1"/&gt;
  &lt;/box&gt;
  &lt;spring flex="1"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;</pre>
 <div class="figure"><img src="boxes/box13.gif" alt="Code shown above rendered."></div>
 <p>In the above example the titled button is centered in the
  middle of the window. This is achieved by creating a
  horizontal box and putting a vertical box inside it. The
  vertical box contains a titledbutton. The magic here is how
  the vertical box and horizontal box are centered. This is
  done by using an invisible component called a
  <code>spring</code>. (A spring is nothing
  special. In CSS it is just a block frame, akin to a
  <code>div</code> in HTML).) By placing
  flexible springs before and after the vertical box and
  before and after the titled button we get a centering
  effect.
 <h2>Intrinsic Sizing of Windows and Dialogs</h2>
 <p>When windows and dialogs are opened in XUL, unless you
  specify a width and height for the window (see <a href="windows.html">Windows
  and Dialogs</a>), the window will intrinsically size itself
  around its content.
 <p>In XUL the outermost <code>window</code>
  tag is a horizontal box. It behaves in every respect like
  the <code>box</code> tag. It can be turned
  into a vertical box by using the
  <code>align</code> attribute.
 <p>Through careful use of boxes, dialogs can be designed so
  that they come up as big as they need to be but no bigger.
  Such a design is handy for dialogs whose appearance might
  change (thus necessitating a size change) because of a
  different skin or different locale (see <a href="packages.html">Packages</a>).
 <p>There are certain caveats when building intrinsically
  sized dialogs. The following rules are guidelines to help
  ensure that you are using boxes correctly.
 <ul>
  <li><strong>Don't specify percentage widths and heights on
   objects that are direct children of boxes.</strong> It is
   meaningless to do so. If you want to specify relative
   flexibility (e.g., one object takes up 20% of the space,
   and the other object takes up 80%), you can do so using
   flex (e.g., flex="20" and flex="80").
  <li><strong>Constrain the width of
   <code>html:div</code> tags
   used inside boxes.</strong> Divs are nothing more than blocks
   of text. When sizing intrinsically, if the width of the
   div is not constrained, all the text will run together on
   one line. Be careful in general about using paragraphs of
   text in dialogs and windows. If you need to do so, make
   sure you place a cap on the width of the div (max-width
   is good for this).
  <li><strong>Be careful about using percentage width/height in
   windows.</strong> If you provide no hints regarding maximum
   size, and only specify rules in terms of percentages,
   you're asking for trouble. 50% of infinity (an
   unconstrained width) is still infinity. If your dialogs
   are coming up really tall or really wide, you're probably
   guilty of this. You're probably specifying percentages
   when you should be using flex instead.
 </ul>
 <h2>Which widgets are boxes?</h2>
 <p>Right now many of the other widgets are also boxes, and
  thus support the align attribute and all of the other
  behavior described in this document. These widgets
  include:
 <ul>
  <li>Window (horizontal)
  <li>Toolbox (vertical)
  <li>Toolbar (horizontal)
  <li>Menu Bar (XP menu only, horizontal)
  <li>Menu Popup (XP menu only, vertical)
  <li>Tab Widget (see the spec.)
 </ul>
 <h2>Open Issues</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>Boxes will probably implement
   <code>vertical-align</code> at some point
   (like table cells do), so that alignment along a box axis
   can be done without resorting to springs.
  <li>Should flex move into CSS?
  <li>When a box has excess space and contains only
   inflexible components, it draws its border incorrectly.
   (It draws the border around only its children and doesn't
   include the excess space.)
 </ul>
 <h2>Visual Debugging</h2>
 <p>Boxes support visual debugging that allows you see and
  query their layout. This is extremely useful when trying to
  debug a troublesome UI.
 <p><a href="boxdebug.xul">Example</a> (viewable with
  Mozilla)
 <pre class="code">&lt;box debug="true" align="horizontal" flex="1"&gt;
 &lt;titledbutton value="flexible button1" flex="1"/&gt;
 &lt;titledbutton value="fixed button1"/&gt;
 &lt;box align="vertical" flex="1"&gt;
  &lt;titledbutton value="flexible button1" flex="1"/&gt;
  &lt;titledbutton value="flexible button1" flex="2"/&gt;
  &lt;titledbutton value="fixed button1"/&gt;
 &lt;/box&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;</pre>
 <p>Visual debugging can turned on by setting the attribute
  &igrave;debug=true on a element in the document. If the
  element is a box or contains boxes, the boxes show up
  visually. Horizontal boxes are drawn in blue and have
  springs/struts stretched across the tops of their children.
  Vertical boxes are red and have their springs/struts to the
  left of their children. Each spring/strut represents the
  min, preferred, and max sizes as well as the flexibility of
  its child. If the child&iacute;s flexibility is 0 the box
  will show a strut for it. If the flexibility is greater than
  0 the box will draw a spring for it. This allows you to
  visually see how dialog can stretch.. Try resizing the
  example above. Notice how flexible children take up space
  while fixed ones do not.
 <h3>Querying the spring/strut</h3>
 <p>The min, max, pref, and flexibility can easily be
  displayed by bringing the console window to the front and
  moving the mouse over any spring or strut. The following
  information is displayed to the console:
 <pre class="code">FrameType(tag): min(width[CSS],height), pref(width, height), max(width,height), flex(1.000)</pre>
 <dl>
  <dt>FrameType
  <dd>This is the type of frame used to display the child.
  <dt>Tag
  <dd>This is the tag of the child. Ex (div, titledbutton, etc)
  <dt>Min
  <dd>The minimum width and height this child can be sized to.
  <dt>Pref
  <dd>The preferred size the child would like to be.
  <dt>Max
  <dd>the maximum size the child can be. (INF means no limit)
  <dt>Flex
  <dd>The child&iacute;s flexibility (if it&iacute;s 0 its a strut)
 </dl>
 <p><dfn>[CSS]</dfn>: To the right of any value: width,height an
  optional CSS flag can appear. This indicates that this value
  was redefined via CSS or as and attribute on the tag itself.
  For example:
 <pre class="code">titiledbutton{
 min-width: 100px;
}

&lt;box debug="true"&gt;
 &lt;titledbutton flex="1" value="foo"/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;</pre>
 <p>If you were to move over the spring for the titledbutton
  you might get this:
 <pre class="code">nsTitledButtonFrame(titledbutton): min(100[CSS], 50), pref(50,50), max(INF,INF), flex(1.000)</pre>
 <p>Indicating that the min-width was redefined to be 100px
  in CSS.
