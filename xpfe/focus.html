<H1>Context Nodes and Focus</H1>

<P><I>Draft 0<BR>
Last modified on 2/16/99 by Mike Pinkerton</I></P>

<P><I>This is a concatenation of some relevant emails and newsgroup
postings about command parameter. Hyatt and Rod are behind most of
this, blame them. This document was penned by hyatt after midnight,
so all bets are off :-).</I></P>

<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>If you have not yet read the <A HREF="broadcasters.html">Broadcaster/Observer
document</A>, which describes the replacement for observing changes
in appCore state, please do so now and understand the example. The
rest of this discussion builds upon that example. To summarize, we
are passing parameters to the appCore at the event-handling level. We
hook up to a broadcaster to pick up the enabled state, and we call
into the appCore by invoking methods through JavaScript.</P>

<P>This document adds the concept of a <I>Context</I> node which
works in conjuction with <I>Broadcaster</I> and <I>Observer</I> nodes
to track focus and allow the same UI element to perform different
actions based on which component (say a bookmarks tree or a mail
tree) is currently in focus in a given window.</P>

<H2>Handling Focus With Context Nodes</H2>

<P>To do focus, we need to have a new kind of node: a <I>Context</I>
node (suggested by Rod). We need to know how to do two things with
it. We have to (a) change observation relationships based on what has
the focus, and (b) do something different based on what has the
focus.</P>

<H4><A NAME=Syntax></A><B>XUL Syntax</B></H4>

<PRE>&lt;incontext element="nodeIdentifier" oncommand="some JavaScript"/&gt;</PRE>

<H4>Example</H4>

<P>So how does this work? Like this... pardon any DOM calls that
aren't exactly right. Remember that the UI logic seems backwards
because the DOM attribute for enabled/disable state is called
"disabled."</P>

<PRE>&lt;window&gt;

...

&lt;broadcasterset&gt;
   &lt;broadcaster id="cantDeleteInMailTree"/&gt;   // Surfaced by the mail AppCore
   &lt;broadcaster id="cantDeleteInBookmarksTree"/&gt; // Surfaced by the bookmarks AppCore
&lt;/broadcasterset&gt;

...

&lt;button id="myDeleteButton" onClick="getChildWithAttribute("infocus").doCommand()"&gt;
   &lt;incontext element="mailTree" onCommand="mailAppCore.delete()"&gt;
      &lt;observes element="cantDeleteInMailTree" attribute="disabled"/&gt;
   &lt;/incontext&gt;
   &lt;incontext element="bookmarksTree" onCommand="bookmarksAppCore.deleteBookmarks()"&gt;
      &lt;observes element="cantDeleteInBookmarksTree" attribute="disabled"/&gt;
   &lt;/incontext&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;

...

&lt;tree id="mailTree" onselectionchanged="mailCore.selectionChanged(...)"&gt;
   &lt;broadcaster id="cantDeleteInMailTree"/&gt;...&lt;/tree&gt;

&lt;tree id="bookmarksTree" onSelectionChanged="bookmarksCore.selectionChanged(...)"&gt;
   &lt;broadcaster id="cantDeleteInBookmarksTree"/&gt;...&lt;/tree&gt;

...

&lt;/window&gt;</PRE>

<P>So here's how this example works:</P>

<P>First, there are two broadcasters for the enabled state of
deletion...one for a mail tree and one for a bookmarks tree. We now
have a button on our toolbar that simply says "DELETE", and it wants
to do the right thing depending on which tree widget has the
focus.</P>

<P>To do this, we need to make it so that the OBSERVES relationship
on the button is dynamic based on context. When the focus switches,
what the button observes has to change. We do this with context
nodes.</P>

<P>Context nodes are children of the actual widget . The observes
relationships they contain as children are what should be applied to
the actual widget when this context is in focus.</P>

<P>So how does a Context node get notified when the focus changes? We
hook up the Context node up as an observer of an "inFocus" attribute
on a widget. When a widget in XUL grabs the focus, it will set this
inFocus attribute to TRUE on its node, which will result in any and
all context nodes that are listening for this attribute getting
notified.</P>

<P>A Context node will then know (again, more smarts in our content
nodes) to flip a switch and change the broadcasters that its parent
widget is observing. Because a context node is listening to the
inFocus attribute, it will also set/unset this inFocus attribute on
itself when it gets notified.</P>

<P>When a mailTree's selection changes, it calls into the AppCore,
and since we have parameters, the tree can pass in the originating
widget, the widget's selection (as a range) and its broadcaster
node(or nodes). The AppCore then just has to implement a completely
generic function that decides, based on the selected items, whether
or not the broadcaster node that's passed in should be enabled or
disabled.</P>

<P>When a command needs to be executed from the button, you can use
the standard DOM APIs to grab the correct context node (by looking
for the one that has its inFocus attribute set). You can then call
doCommand to make the JavaScript contained inside the onCommand
attribute fire.</P>

<P>The one non-obvious part about the syntax in the example above
is</P>

<PRE>&lt;context obsid="mailWidget"&gt;</PRE>

<P>This is shorthand for saying that the context node will observe a
broadcaster with id mailWidget and that it will observe the inFocus
attribute on that broadcaster.</P>
