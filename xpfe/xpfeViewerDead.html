<h2>
<b><font color="#FF0000">UPDATE:</font></b> xpfeViewer is
<b><font color="#FF0000">dead!</font></b>
Long live xpAppViewer. Until xpAppViewer is more operational, use viewer
to test html rendering.</h2>
The prototype application known as "xpfeViewer" has been scrapped. In its
place lives a new application which is the foundation for the 5.0 product.
All further development should be targeted at the appViewer, owned by the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/xpapps/">XPApps</a> team. Our group never
owned xpfeViewer (only the widgets and services it provided) and we will
continue to develop those widgets/services in the new shell application.
