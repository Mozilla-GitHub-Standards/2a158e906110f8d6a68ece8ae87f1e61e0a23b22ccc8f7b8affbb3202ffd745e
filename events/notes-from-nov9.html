<h1>Notes from November 9, 2001 Mozilla Developer Day</h1>
<p>Our low key affair turned out rather well. About 
  70 or 80 people participated, a higher turnout than we expected given recent 
  events. People stayed awake, remained interested, asked a bunch of questions, 
  and stayed until the end of the program. </p>
<p>
We'll add links to the original 
<a href="developer-day.html">announcement page</a> as follow-up info 
becomes available. This will include slides, videos and survey results. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Slides are or will be available for most of the talks. Slides available 
    now have links in the text below. </li>
  <li>Videotapes were made of most sessions. Unfortunately, there is no video 
    of the XPCOM talk due to audiovisual problems. The Business Forum 
   discussion was also not taped. 
  </li>
  <li>The videos require processing before we can post them, so they aren't 
    available yet. When they are, links will be added to the announcement page.     The University of Montreal at Quebec has offered to host the videos, and 
    we'll include a link to their site if this happens. 
  </li>
  <li>Mitchell will be sending out a Survey to attendees in the next couple of 
    days. If we get useful data back, we'll post a summary of the results. (Or 
    the results themselves, if they are in a legible format.) 
  </li>
  <li>We did not have a closing session, and so did not talk about planning 
    future 
    events. Mitchell will try to send out information and solicit feedback on 
    possible future events, and to provide more notice next time.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Session Summary (Partial)</h2>
<p>Mitchell put together a brief summary of the sessions 
  she attended. Unfortunately, this covers only a few of the talks. Summaries 
  of the other sessions would be more than welcome.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<a
href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/devday2001/contents.html">
Developing Applications with XUL and JavaScript</a></p>
<p>We started with a great talk by Rob Ginda describing 
  a set of tools for building JavaScript and XUL applications, including 
  the JavaScript debugger and Rob's new template processor, which 
  generates new XUL application 
  code from templatized source files. The tools are under development, but are 
  already very helpful. Check out the <a
href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/devday2001/contents.html">slides</a>, and 
  see what's in the works.
</p>

<p>Joe Hewitt finished up this talk with a description 
  and demo of the &quot;<a
href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/devday2001/inspector.html">Document Inspector</a>.&quot; 
This is an application Joe built on the Mozilla platform, which allows the user 
to view and edit the various facets of a XUL, HTML, or any XML-based document.
Joe's talk was stopped twice by the audience's gasps of appreciation, so check 
it out.
</p>

<p>Then we split into two groups, one focused on core 
  components in Mozilla, and one on business and project management issues.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Components</p>
<p>On the component side, Doug Turner started with 
a discussion of XPCOM, Gagan Saksena continued with an overview of the 
networking architecture in Mozilla, and Vidur Apparao finished the set 
with a discussion of embedding Mozilla's browsing engine in a range of 
applications. I didn't attend these talks, so can't say much about them. 
Slides are linked to from the 
<a href="developer-day.html">announcement page</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="../docs/ora-oss2001/state-of-mozilla/index.html">
  Overview of the Project</a>.  </p>
<p>Mitchell started by describing the companies using 
Mozilla technology. The list is more varied than one might think, so take a 
<a href="../docs/ora-oss2001/state-of-mozilla/04_Out_and_About_8.html">look</a>.
The lists are ready for updating, so let her know if you know of companies or 
projects using Mozilla technology that aren't included. Mitchell also described 
a range of ways projects and companies may choose to participate in the Mozilla 
project, starting from &quot;take the executable and run&quot; to 
<a href="../docs/ora-oss2001/state-of-mozilla/08_Developing_working_2_5.html">
active participation and leadership</a> in the development of code, milestone 
and roadmap decisions.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="dev-day2001/community-testing/2_activities_triage.html">
Community QA</a>
</p>

<p>Asa Dotzler talked about the range of activities performed by mozilla's 
QA community, including testing, bug reporting, bug triage, 
resolving duplicate and invalid bugs, developing test cases and running 
functional tests. He noted that there are typically more than 2500 
downloads of the daily verification builds, and something approaching 
200,000 downloads of Milestone builds. Between 100 and 300 bugs are 
reported daily, so the volume of work is significant. Asa also included 
statistics on the number of people reporting and 
<a href="dev-day2001/community-testing/2_activities_triage.html">resolving</a> 
bugs. Asa concluded with a brief discussion of some future Community QA 
activities he would like to see take shape.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Business Forum</p>
<p>Mitchell opened the Business Forum by noting that the Mozilla project 
was founded to create a distributed development and distribution 
system, that active and successful participation by vendors shipping 
Mozilla-based products is a key element in the ultimate success of the 
project, and that the Business Forum is intended as an ongoing discussion 
to assist vendors in doing this.
</p>

<p>Participants identified the biggest problem for 
companies using Mozilla as the lack of adequate documentation. Several 
participants pointed out that the documentation problem should diminish 
once Mozilla 1.0 ships and books are published about Mozilla. In the 
meantime, several people said they were willing to update and correct 
inadequate documentation as they found it, but didn't feel mozilla.org 
had described a clear mechanism for doing so. The short answer is 
&quot;file a bug, add an attachment to the bug that 
fixes the problem, and we'll use Bugzilla to track this.&quot; A better answer 
should be possible, and mozilla.org will try to look into this.
</p>

<p>Other suggestions included:</p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li>Creating a newsgroup to discuss issues 
    germane to shipping commercial products;
  </li>
  <li>Setting up the Status Reports on <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">
    www.mozilla.org</a> 
    so that one could subscribe to status reports for particular areas;
  </li>
  <li>Creating a mechanism for input regarding important features; and
  </li>
  <li>Creating a mechanism for companies to fund 
    development of the Mozilla codebase and mozilla.org.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
