<h1>Mozilla bugs</h1>
<p class="important">Are you here because you have a problem with
Netscape Browser? If so, you're in the wrong place. Try visiting
their <a href=
"http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/support/default.jsp">technical
support</a> site or use the Netscape <a href=
"http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/support/bugreport.jsp">bug
reporting form</a> instead.</p>
<p class="important">Are you here because you have a problem with a
Debian branded product? If so, you're in the wrong place. Try
visiting their <a href="http://www.debian.org/support">technical
support</a> site or use their <a href=
"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=mozilla-firefox">bug
tracking system</a> instead.</p>
<p>Do you want to report a bug with one of our <a href=
"../releases/">milestone or nightly builds</a> or with a copy of
Mozilla that you compiled yourself? <a href=
"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> is the place to submit
bug reports for software distributed by mozilla.org. This page
gives an overview of how Bugzilla works. Read the <a href=
"http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Bug_writing_guidelines">bug
writing guidelines</a> as well, for tips on how to write useful bug
reports.</p>
<h2>What Is Bugzilla?</h2>
<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> is a
database for bugs. It lets people report bugs and assigns these
bugs to the appropriate developers. Developers can use Bugzilla to
keep a to-do list as well as to prioritize, schedule and track
dependencies.</p>
<p>Not all 'bugs' are bugs. Some items in the database are known as
<dfn>Enhancement Requests</dfn> or <dfn>Requests For
Enhancement</dfn> (<abbr>RFE</abbr>). An <abbr>RFE</abbr> is a bug
whose severity field is set to 'enhancement'. People often say
'bug' when they mean 'item in Bugzilla', so <abbr>RFE</abbr>s often
wind up being called bugs.</p>
<p>Enter the tasks you're planning to work on as enhancement
requests and Bugzilla will help you track them and allow others to
see what you plan to work on. If people can see your flight plan,
they can avoid duplicating your work and can possibly help out or
offer feedback.</p>
<p class="note">Looking for the source of Bugzilla? If you want to
set up a Bugzilla on your own server, you can get it <a href=
"http://www.bugzilla.org/" title="Bugzilla">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Anatomy Of A Bug</h2>
<p>Bugs and <abbr>RFEs</abbr> are composed of many fields. Some of
them are described here.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Component</dt>
<dd>The Mozilla application is composed of many different
components such as the networking library, javascript, and the
layout engine. Carefully read the <a href=
"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi">component
descriptions</a> if you're unsure of which component to attribute
your bug to. Some components are very similar. For example,
problems with table layout should be assigned to <abbr>HTML</abbr>
Tables, not to Layout. The component you choose determines which
person Bugzilla assigns the bug to.</dd>
<dt>Status Whiteboard</dt>
<dd>The Status Whiteboard is used for writing short notes about the
bug.</dd>
<dt>Keywords</dt>
<dd>This field is used to store various
<p><a href=
"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi">keywords</a>.
For instance, the <a href="../newlayout/bugathon.html">BugAThon</a>
uses it to to note when bugs have test cases (using the keyword
<code>testcase</code>).</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>helpwanted</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Developers can use this field for posting
<code>helpwanted</code> notices. Write <code>helpwanted</code> in
the Keywords field of one of your bugs or <abbr>RFE</abbr>s and
others searching for things to do will find it. People interested
in <a href="../get-involved.html">getting involved</a> can search
Bugzilla for bugs and <abbr>RFE</abbr>s marked
<code>helpwanted</code>. Maybe one of them will have the expertise
and resources to help you with your problem.</p>
<p>For instance, if your code has a bug on some platform which you
don't have access to, or with some language you don't know, try
adding this keyword.</p>
<p>Or, as with any developer, you're probably swamped with bugs.
Some of these bugs will be lower priority than others. Try marking
bugs that you realize you won't be able to any time soon as
<code>helpwanted</code>. Someone else with different priorities may
see this and help you out.</p>
<p>When marking bugs (or <abbr>RFE</abbr>s)
<code>helpwanted</code>, be sure to add a comment carefully
explaining what work needs to be done, and how to do it, if you
know. The better you can explain the problem and its solution, the
more likely it is that someone can provide a useful solution.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Target Milestone</dt>
<dd>The Mozilla project uses target milestones to plan Mozilla's
development process. If a bug is marked <code>mozilla1.3</code>, it
means an assigned developer picked Mozilla 1.3 as his/her estimate
of the earliest milestone at which that bug might be resolved. This
field should only be set by the person responsible for the
bug.</dd>
<dt>Dependency</dt>
<dd>If a bug can't be fixed until another bug is fixed, that's a
dependency. For any bug, you can list the bugs it depends on and
bugs that depend on it. Bugzilla can display a dependency graphs
which shows which the bugs it depends on and are dependent on
it.</dd>
<dt>Attachment</dt>
<dd>Adding an attachment to a bug can be very useful. Test cases,
screen shots and <a href=
"../editor/logging/api-logging.html">editor logs</a> all can help
pinpoint the bug and help the developer reproduce it. If you fix a
bug, attach the patch to the bug. This is the preferred way to keep
track of patches since it makes it easier for others to find and
test. To make a patch, you need to generate a diff file containing
the differences between the file with your changes and the original
file in the repository. To generate a patch file enumerating
changes for all files in the current directory try <kbd>cvs diff -u
&gt; mypatch.diff</kbd>. To apply a patch, go to the proper
directory and <kbd>patch &lt; bugpatch.diff</kbd>.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Life Cycle Of A Bug</h2>
<p>What happens to a bug when it is first reported depends on who
reported it. New Bugzilla accounts by default create bugs which are
<code>UNCONFIRMED</code> - this means that a <abbr>QA</abbr>
(Quality Assurance) person needs to look at it and confirm it
exists before it gets turned into a <code>NEW</code> bug.</p>
<p>If you have been working in Bugzilla for a while and believe you
are worthy of being able to create <code>NEW</code> bugs, mail
<a href=
"http://www.gerv.net/hacking/before-you-mail-gerv.html">Gerv</a>.
When a bug becomes <code>NEW</code>, the developer will probably
look at the bug and either accept it or give it to someone else. If
the bug remains new and inactive for more than a week, Bugzilla
nags the bug's owner with email until action is taken. Whenever a
bug is reassigned or has its component changed, its status is set
back to <code>NEW</code>. The <code>NEW</code> status means that
the bug is newly added to a particular developer's plate, not that
the bug is newly reported.</p>
<p>Those to whom additional permissions have been given have the
ability to change all the fields of a bug (by default, you can only
change a few). Whenever you change a field in a bug it's a good
idea to add additional comments to explain what you are doing and
why. Make a note whenever you do things like change the component,
reassign the bug, create an attachment, add a dependency or add
someone to the <abbr>CC</abbr> list. Whenever someone makes a
change to the bug or adds a comment, the owner, reporter, the
<abbr>CC</abbr> list and those who voted for the bug are sent an
email (unless they have switched it off) showing the changes to the
bug report.</p>
<p>If you are doing much work in Bugzilla, you might want to check
out the <a href="../quality/help/"><abbr>QA</abbr> Help Page</a>,
which has various useful resources and things to do.</p>
<p>When a bug is closed it's marked <code>RESOLVED</code> and given
one of the following resolutions.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>FIXED</code></dt>
<dd>A fix for this bug has been checked into the tree and tested by
the person marking it <code>FIXED</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>INVALID</code></dt>
<dd>The problem described is not a bug, or not a bug in
Mozilla.</dd>
<dt><code>WONTFIX</code></dt>
<dd>The problem described is a bug which will never be fixed, or a
problem report which is a "feature", not a bug.</dd>
<dt><code>DUPLICATE</code></dt>
<dd>The problem is a duplicate of an existing bug. Marking a bug
duplicate requires the bug number of the duplicating bug and will
add a comment with the bug number into the description field of the
bug it is a duplicate of.</dd>
<dt><code>WORKSFORME</code></dt>
<dd>All attempts at reproducing this bug in the current build were
futile. If more information appears later, please re-open the bug,
for now, file it.</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../quality/"><abbr>QA</abbr></a> (this could be you -
check out <a href="../quality/help/">the <abbr>QA</abbr> help
page</a>) looks at resolved bugs and ensures the appropriate action
has been taken. If they agree, the bug is marked
<code>VERIFIED</code>. Bugs remain in this state until the product
ships, at which time the bug is marked <code>CLOSED</code>. Bugs
may come back to life by becoming <code>REOPENED</code>.</p>
<p>Be careful when changing the status of someone else's bugs.
Instead of making the change yourself, it's usually best to make a
note of your proposed change as a comment and to let the bug's
owner review this and make the change themselves. For instance, if
you think one bug is a duplicate of another, make a note of it in
the 'Additional Comments' section.</p>
<p>If you make a lot of useful comments to someone's bugs they may
come to trust your judgement and ask you to go ahead and make the
changes yourself, but unless they do, it's best to be cautious and
only make comments.</p>
