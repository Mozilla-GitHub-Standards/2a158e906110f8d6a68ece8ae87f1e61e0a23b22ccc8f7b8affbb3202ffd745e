<div class="checkboxon">Block pop-up windows</div>
<p>By default, Firefox blocks annoying pop-up windows on web sites.
Unchecking this option will disable pop-up blocking.</p>

<p>Some sites make legitimate use of pop-up windows. Therefore, the pop-up
blocking feature has a simple whitelist mechanism to allow certain sites to
open pop-ups anyway. To add a site to the whitelist, click <span
class="button">Exceptions</span> and enter the address of the web site
and click <span class="button">Allow</span>.</p>

<p> To remove a site from the whitelist, select that site from the list and
then click <span class="button">Remove Site</span>. To clear the whitelist
completely, click <span class="button">Remove All Sites</span>.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="images/fx2-opt_imagemanager.png" alt="" /></div>
<div class="checkboxon">Load images automatically</div>

<div class="checkboxon">Enable JavaScript</div>
<p>JavaScript is a scripting language commonly used to construct web pages.
Programmers use JavaScript to make web pages more interactive; for example,
to display forms and buttons. Disabling JavaScript may cause some sites not
to work properly, including this one.</p>

<p>While it is usually recommended to keep JavaScript enabled, there are
some functions that you may want to disable. Click the <span

  <p>Check mark this option to allow scripts to hide the status bar in pop-up windows.</p>

  <div class="checkboxoff">Change status bar text</div>
  <p>Check mark this option to allow scripts to use status bar text scrolling and Web
  address hiding.</p>

  <p class="note">The options displayed here are certainly not all of them.
  You can also make sure all popup windows are resizable, minimizable, and
  that the menu and toolbar is always displayed. All of these options are

  <p>Normally, web pages are displayed in the default font set by your browser
  or in a font chosen by the web pages' authors. Here, you can select the font 
  and font size used when web pages don't specify one. For more advanced font 
  options, click on <span class="button">Advanced...</span>, or for colors options, 
  click on <span class="button">Colors...</span>.</p>

    <p>You can actually set a specific default font for various types of fonts, 
    and character sets.</p>

    <p>To change the default fonts by font type and character set:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>From the <q>Fonts for</q> drop-down list, choose a character set. For
      instance, to set default fonts for the Western (Roman) character set, choose
      <q>Western</q>.</li>

    <li>Select whether proportional text should be <span style="font-family:
      serif">serif (like "Times New Roman")</span> or <span style="font-family:
      sans-serif">sans-serif (like "Arial")</span>. Then specify the font size you
      want for proportional text.</li>
    <li>Specify the font to use for Serif, Sans-serif and Monospace fonts. You
      can also change the size for <span style="font-family: monospace">Monospace
      fonts</span>. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Finally, you can set the minimum font size to be used on screen. This can
    be useful on some sites that use very small fonts that are barely
    readable.</p>

  <p>With this option selected, Firefox will check the current
  site against a frequently updated list stored on your computer.  No data about
  the sites you visit is transferred to third-party anti-phishing providers
  during normal browsing.  Since phishing techniques and sites evolve quickly,

    <div class="checkboxoff">I am about to view an encrypted page</div>
    <p>When this option is enabled, Firefox will notify you
       every time you are about to view an encrypted page.</p>
    <div class="checkboxon">I am about to view a page that uses low-grade encryption</div>
    <p>With this option enabled, Firefox will warn you when
       you visit a page which uses low-grade encryption.</p>
    <div class="checkboxoff">I leave an encrypted page for one that isn't encrypted</div>
    <p>With this option enabled, Firefox will warn you
       every time you move from an encrypted page to an unencrypted page either
       by selecting a link on the page, selecting a bookmark or typing a new
       address into the location bar.</p>
    <div class="checkboxon">I submit information that's not encrypted</div>
    <p>When this option is enabled, Firefox will warn you
       when you submit data via a form that's not encrypted.</p>
    <div class="checkboxon">I'm about to view an encrypted page that contains some unencrypted information</div>
    <p>With this option enabled, Firefox will warn you when
       the page you're viewing contains a mixture of encrypted and
       unencrypted content. If an encrypted page contains unencrypted data,
       you should verify the identity of the page you're viewing prior to
       entering sensitive data.</p>

  <div class="checkboxoff">Always use the cursor keys to navigate within pages</div>

  <p>Find As You Type is a very useful feature in Firefox. It is a fast way of
  finding links or text in a Web page without the need of displaying complex
  search dialogs. Read more about Find As You Type at <a

  <div class="checkboxon">Use autoscrolling</div>
  <p>Autoscrolling is a useful feature which allows you to scroll the page by
  just holding down the middle mouse button (usually the scroll wheel) and
  move the mouse up or down. Some people find this annoying so here's the
  option for it.</p>

  <div class="checkboxoff">Use smooth scrolling</div>
  <p>Smooth scrolling can be very useful if you read a lot of long pages. 
  Normally, when you press the <kbd>Page Down</kbd> key, the view jumps 
  directly down one page. With Smooth Scrolling, it slides down more smoothly, 
  so you are actually able to see how much it scrolls. This makes it easier to 
  resume reading from the point you were before.</p>

  <div class="checkboxon">Check my spelling as I type</div>
  <p>When this option is enabled, Firefox will check your spelling
  and offer possible corrections as you type in web forms.  Note that you
  may need to download a dictionary; to do so, right-click on any text field, 
  enable spellchecking if necessary, and then use the provided 
  <span class="mnu">Languages</span> menu to download a dictionary.</p>

    <span class="button">Remove</span> button.</p>

    <p>You can reorder languages to determine the preferred one in case a page
    is provided in two or more of your selected languages. Do this using the

  <div class="right"><img class="screenshot" src="images/fx2-opt_connection.png"
  alt="Connection Options Panel" /></div> <p>Many organizations block access from
  the Internet to their networks. This prevents outside parties from gaining
  access to sensitive information. The protection is called a firewall.</p>

  <p>If your organization has a firewall, the browser may need to go through a
  proxy server before connecting you to the Internet. The proxy server prevents
  outsiders from breaking into your organization's private network.</p>

  <dl>
  <dt>Configure Proxies to Access the Internet</dt>
  <dd>
    <div class="radioon">Direct connection to the Internet</div>
    <p>This is the default option. Choose this if you don't want to use a proxy.</p>
    <div class="radiooff">Auto-detect proxy settings for this network</div>
    <p>Choose this if you want Firefox to automatically detect the
      proxy settings for your network.</p>
    <div class="radiooff">Manual proxy configuration</div>
    <p>Choose this if you don't have a proxy location (<acronym title="uniform
      resource locator, or Web address">URL</acronym>). Ask your system administrator
      for the names and port numbers of the servers running proxy software
      for each network service and enter the information in the appropriate
      fields.</p>
    <div class="radiooff">Automatic proxy configuration <acronym title="uniform
      resource locator, or Web address">URL</acronym>:</div>
    <p>If there's a proxy configuration file at your workplace, ask the system
      administrator for its <acronym title="uniform resource locator, or Web

  <p>Pages you view are normally stored in a special cache folder for
  quicker viewing the next time you visit the same page. Here you are able to
  specify the amount of disk space the cache can use.</p>
  <p class="note">In addition to specifying the amount of disk space, you can
  also <a href="tips#oth_cache">specify the cache folder</a> and <a

  <p>Clicking on <span class="button">Clear Now</span> immediately clears the 
  current contents of the cache, freeing the disk space used by the cache.</p>

  <p>By default, Firefox will periodically check and notify you when a new
  version is available. Uncheck this option to disable the periodic check.</p>
  <div class="checkboxon">Installed Add-ons</div>
  <p>By default, Firefox will periodically check and notify you when a new

  this option to disable the periodic check.</p>
  <div class="checkboxon">Search Engines</div>

  this option to disable the periodic check.</p>
  <div class="section">
  <div class="checkboxon">Warn me if this will disable any of my add-ons</div>
  <p>This option determines whether you will be warned
     before the installation of an update which would require an incompatible
     add-on to be disabled because no newer, compatible version exists.  The
     warning will allow you to postpone installation of the update, though at
     the expense of improvements included in it.</p>

  <p>If all extensions and themes are compatible or can be updated to be
     compatible, the Firefox update will be installed.  Upon restart
     you will be asked to install any needed add-on updates so that you can
     continue to use them.</p>

<p>Firefox automatically records the updates you have installed. You can view 
   information about these updates by clicking the

<p class="note">You must be running Firefox as an administrator
   or as the user who originally installed Firefox to install Firefox updates.</p>

<dl><dt>Protocols</dt>
<dd>
  <div class="checkboxon">Use SSL 3.0</div>
  <p>Specifies whether you want to send and receive secured information
  through SSL3 (Secured Sockets Layer Level 3), a protocol that is intended to
  be more secure than SSL2, standard protocol for communicating securely with 
  web sites. Disabling it will prevent you from visiting some sites.</p>
  <div class="checkboxon">Use TLS 1.0</div>
  <p>Specifies whether you want to send and receive secured information

<dt>Certificates</dt>
<dd><p>Certificates help perform encryption and decryption of connections to secure sites.</p>
  <div class="radioon">Select one automatically</div>
  <p>When a web site requests a secure connection, Firefox will by
     default automatically use an appropriate certificate.</p>
  <div class="radiooff">Ask Every Time</div>
  <p>If you wish to manually choose a certificate (for example, if you 
     wish to use a certain type of encryption instead of what is automatically 
     selected), select this option and you'll be in complete
     control of what certificates you use while browsing.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Click the <span class="button">View Certificates</span> button to view 
  stored certificates, import new certificates, and back up or delete old 
  certificates in Firefox.</p>

<p>Firefox can use Certificate Revocation Lists (also known as CRLs) to 
  ensure that your certificates are always valid. Click the 
  <span class="button">Revocation Lists</span> button to manage the CRLs 
  installed on your computer.</p>

<p>Firefox can verify the validity of your certificates using OCSP (Online 
  Certificate Status Protocol) every time they are viewed or used. Firefox 
  does not use OCSP by default, but if you want to enable it, you can click 
  on the <span class="button">Verification</span> button. You will most likely 
  only need to change this if your Internet environment requires it.</p>

<p>Security devices can encrypt and decrypt connections and store certificates 
  and passwords. If you need to use a security device other than the one in 
  Firefox, click the <span class="button">Security Devices</span> Security Devices
  button.</p>
