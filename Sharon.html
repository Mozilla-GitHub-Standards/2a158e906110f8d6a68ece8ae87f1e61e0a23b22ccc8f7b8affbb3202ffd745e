Sharon came to Netscape in late summer of '94 as a founding member
of our QA department.  She came for fun 
as much as anything else, and was quickly appreciated as a very 
valuable contributor to the team.  Sharon was listed in various
early Navigator
<TT>about:authors</TT>
pages as <i>Chimp Wrangler</i>, <i>Plausible Deniability</i>, and
<i>Octopus Wrangler</i>.
<P>
Since then, Sharon remained in the middle of every Navigator
release.  While she was well respected for her opinions,
clear thinking, and penetrating insight,
she was also highly prized as a friend.
<P>
Last week, Sharon succumbed after a long fight with cancer.
We at mozilla.org will miss her.
