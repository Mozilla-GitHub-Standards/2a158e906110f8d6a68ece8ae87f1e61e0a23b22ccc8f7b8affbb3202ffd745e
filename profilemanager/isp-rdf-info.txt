Sample RDF files

http://lxr.mcom.com/commercial/source/mailnews/base/ispdata/aol.rdf
http://lxr.mcom.com/commercial/source/mailnews/base/ispdata/nswebmail.rdf

If you already have all the infrastructure ready to test your 'launcher' program with you, please create and rdf file modeling after the rdf files mentioned above. Please place that file under

(windows)
<Install Dirve>:\<Install Directory>\Netscape 6\defaults\isp
<Install Dirve>:\<Install Directory>\Netscape 6\defaults\isp\en-US

(linux)

(mac)

Note : the default language pack is en-US. If you happen to choose en-GB or others, please place your rdf file under those packages also.

1) All of these RDF files talk about POP/IMAP mail server and the config for them.  Is there a similar mechanism for news servers?  If so, what are the tags that need to go in the RDF files.

2) What should I call the RDF file?  Can I call it any name foo.rdf?

3) Also, is it correct to assume that this should be done /after/ -CreateProfile?

All of these RDF files talk about POP/IMAP mail server and the config
for them.  Is there a similar mechanism for news servers?  If so, what
are the tags that need to go in the RDF files.
 
Yep, you can do news, and tags are the same..here are some details:
- generic server tags match the attributes in
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/mailnews/base/public/nsIMsgIncomingServer.idl
(they automatically map to any object that's listed as "attribute" in this IDL file)
- identity tags match the same way for:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/mailnews/base/public/nsIMsgIdentity.idl
- smtp tags match:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/mailnews/compose/public/nsISmtpServer.idl

the incoming server type is a string, either "imap", "pop3", or "nntp" (there is also a "none" servertype for Local Folders, and a "movemail" server type, but movemail wasn't implemented in N6)
 
Q: What should I call the RDF file?  Can I call it any name foo.rdf?
 
you can call it whatever you want - the rdf datasource just reads in all files in those directories
 
Also, is it correct to assume that this should be done /after/ -CreateProfile? Yep.. the profile needs to be created so we have a place dump the prefs.js :)
