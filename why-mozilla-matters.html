<h1>why mozilla matters</h1>
<P class="note">The author of this happy tale is 
<A HREF="http://www.go2net.com/people/paulp/">Paul Phillips</A>,
CTO of <A HREF="http://www.go2net.com/">go2net</A>, creator of the
<A HREF="http://www.go2net.com/internet/useless/">Useless Pages</A>,
owner of <A HREF="mailto:root@usenet.com">usenet.com</A>,
author of <A HREF="http://www.boa.org/">Boa</A>, operator
of <A HREF="http://www.metacrawler.com/">metacrawler.com</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.playsite.com/">playsite.com</A>,
and various other domains, and all-around nice guy. He's also an
expert at writing about himself in the third person.

<P> It's no exaggeration for me to say that the creation of 
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/">mozilla.org</A>
and the accompanying events are the most important developments in
software since I started paying attention to software development.
This enormous company, this grown-up David, a software powerhouse by
anyone's definition (no matter who might be snacking on their lunch at
this moment) has taken their flagship product, the web browser that put
them on the map, and they are giving away the source.

<P> Those of you that have grown too close to the situation may not
appreciate the brazenness, the audacity, the iconoclasm necessary for
Netscape to dismantle the prison of source code secrecy.  It's one
thing to challenge conventional wisdom, but it's quite another to line
conventional wisdom up against the wall and pump it full of lead.
Source code is supposed to be a software company's lifeblood, its only
way to differentiate itself from its competitors.  Although there are
those of us who understand why the source release makes sense, the
perception among the masses that the source code is the keys to the
store makes this move risky, doubly so for a public company with
thousands of investors and constant media attention.

<P> This is the message you must understand.  The mozilla.org project
is terribly important for the state of ``open-source software''
<A HREF="#opensource">[1]</A>, because
despite the many worthy open-source software projects in relatively wide use
(Linux, Perl, and Apache, to name a few), the success of open-source software
is going to be measured in the public eye by <B>this project</B>.  And it's
going to be an uphill battle.  The source release is commonly viewed in
the media as one driven by desperation, not inspiration.  The
announcement was made months in advance of the source release, giving
everyone plenty of time to build skepticism.  The entire bombshell
would have made much more sense a year or two ago when Netscape was
gaining momentum rather than losing it.

<P> All of this only highlights why it is so important that you, the
software developer, do <B>whatever you can</B> to contribute
to mozilla.org.

<P> Let me warn you that you are about to experience unabashed
evangelism.  If children are in the room, have them look away now.
It's my belief that all of this is exactly as consequential as I've
made it out to be so far, and I'm not done yet.  I'm not getting paid a
dime to gush like this and I have no ulterior motive other than
advancing open-source software as a viable software development paradigm.
Without taking away from the significant progress made by 
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</A> in open-source software, I assert 
that mozilla.org is potentially more significant in the practical
advancement of open-source than GNU has been.

<P> If you care about source code openness, that's a big deal.

<P> From a utilitarian perspective, it is irrelevant what you think of
Netscape's code or their programmers or their business practices or
whether you want them to succeed or fail in general.  The material
issue is that a loud success for mozilla.org will be a triumphant
victory for open-source software, and <strong>it will be imitated</strong>. Wouldn't
you like the source code to Sun's JDK?  To Qualcomm's Eudora?  To Adobe's
Acrobat?  While there is no guarantee that any of these companies will
wake up and smell the CVS repository, you can be sure there are people
inside each of these companies ready and able to lobby for an open
source code model.  A successful mozilla.org project could be the lever
that moves a dozen previously immobile stones.

<P> I have no affiliation with Netscape.  I'm telling you, from one
lover of open-source software to another, that this is the best chance that
you may ever see to advance the software industry toward more open
source code.  Open source isn't going away if mozilla.org fails, but
certain side effects will be unavoidable. A thousand suits on six
continents will remember only this message: <q>the open-source model doesn't
work.</q> In the public mind, open-source software will continue to be grouped
with screen savers and cheesy VGA games until the memory of mozilla.org
can be overcome.

<P> The folks at mozilla.org didn't win an election to become the flag
bearers for open-source code, but Netscape had an opportunity to create
the highest profile open-source software project in history --
and they did. It doesn't matter that we didn't choose the specifics.
It is to the advantage of every software developer to <strong>make
mozilla.org work</strong>, to make it work for the open-source code world
<strong class="stronger">and</strong> to make it work for Netscape, so other companies have
every reason to follow suit.  Maximize the opportunity here or you'll
be kicking yourself for years to come.  If we squander this chance and,
ten years from now, software developers are all still locked in their
respective corporate source prisons, I'm going to hunt you down and ask
you what you did to help Mozilla.  And God help you if you can only
jabber some nonsense about expecting someone else to carry the ball.

<P> We could do a lot worse than working on one of the most widely
deployed programs in history.  There are few programs that are equally
invaluable to the most hard-core power user and the net-illiterate.  Is
there any worker in the information age who doesn't now or won't soon
use a web browser every single day?  Forty million people?  How about
four hundred million?  Every one of them running software that's been
directly influenced by you, and not just because it came bundled with
the OS.  Are you getting it yet?

<P> A web browser is large and diverse.  There are dozens of features
you could be working on and a thousand bugs you could be fixing (and if
all goes well, those numbers will be reversed in short order.)  Whether
your forte is network utilization or internationalization or GUI
development or portability abstractions or optimization or caching or
embedded interpreters, a web browser has it all, or as close to it all
as a single program is likely to come.  The visibility, scope, and
significance of the project is going to attract serious programming
talent, talent you could be working with directly on your favorite
features.  Do I have to spell it out for you?

<P> If you know enough to read this essay then you know enough to
contribute!  Create order from chaos.  Write code, document code, track
bugs, fix bugs, organize your fellows, galvanize them into action!
Stare at a source module until you know it better than the author,
conduct usability testing with your sixty year old mother and eleven
year old niece, port Mozilla to the BeOS!  Sacrifice one night a week
to write code, give a lecture at the local university, plant the seeds
of open source in your own boss's mind!  Why am I so enthusiastic?
The better question is, <q>why aren't you?</q>

<P id="opensource">"Open-source software" is the term Netscape prefers to "free
 software" and one I don't mind using. The "free" in free software
 has long bred confusion as people naturally comingle the concepts of
 free speech and free beer. At least "open source" is descriptive and
 unlikely to be misinterpreted. Of course if I weren't writing this to
 be hosted at mozilla.org, I'd say "free software" out of years of
 habit, but I'm being accommodating.
