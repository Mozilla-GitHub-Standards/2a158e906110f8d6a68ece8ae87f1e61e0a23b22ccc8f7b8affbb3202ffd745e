<h3 style="text-align: center;">MOZILLA FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES MORE OPEN,
SCRIPTABLE PLUGINS</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Adobe, Apple, Macromedia, Opera and Sun
Microsystems join in push to modernize plugins and create a richer web
experience</h4>

<p>
June 30, 2004, (Mountain View, CA). The Mozilla Foundation, in
partnership with Adobe, Apple, Macromedia, Opera and Sun Microsystems today
announced a series of changes to web browser plugins that will allow
web developers to offer richer web browsing experiences, helping to
maintain innovation and standards on the Net. The new plugin
technologies will be implemented in, among others, upcoming versions of
the next generation Mozilla Firefox web browser and the Mozilla 1.x
Internet suite and in plugins and browsers developed by the other
companies that are supporting this initiative.</p>

<p>
In response to demand by users, plugin vendors and web developers for
web browser support for an open and scriptable plugin model,
the Mozilla Foundation, in collaboration with Adobe, Apple, Macromedia, Opera,
and Sun Microsystems are working to extend the Netscape Plugin
Application Program Interface (NPAPI) in a manner that allows greater
interactivity with plugins such as Flash, Shockwave, QuickTime and
Java, resulting in a richer, more interactive web. </p>

<p>
Plugins are small programs that web browsers use to display multimedia
content that the browsers themselves don't know how to display, such as
audio and video. Scriptability of plugins is essential for building an
interactive user experience on web pages that use plugins.&nbsp; For
example, a user shopping for clothing on a web site that takes
advantage of the new plugin capabilities could mix and match different
styles and colors for shirts and pants using an interactive Flash
movie, and pricing and other information in an associated web page
would be updated as a result.</p>

<p>
"This initiative will significantly improve the web experience for
users of Firefox, the Mozilla 1.x Internet suite, Safari, and Opera
browsers and will ultimately benefit the overall health of the web,"
commented Mitchell Baker, President of the Mozilla Foundation. "Plugins
are a critical component of the web experience and require ongoing
enhancements and improvements in the way they integrate with
world-class browsers. Without these improvements, enhanced
interactivity could remain tied to a single, proprietary browser
solution, which reduces choice and leads to monoculture on the
web.&nbsp; This new initiative makes enhanced interactivity available
without locking users in to a specific computing platform or web
browser.&nbsp; This will allow users to choose among a range of
browsers without sacrificing interactivity.&nbsp; The Mozilla
Foundation is proud to provide leadership in this collaborative
improvement of the web experience."</p>

<p>
"In order to foster a richer experience on the web, we need to enable
more dynamic and deep interaction between the browser, the plugin, and
web content.&nbsp; This is the first step in that direction; it will
give web content developers new, portable options for creating
innovative experiences and applications.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mozilla
Foundation and our partners are looking at ways to improve the tools
available to content developers, and to provide a better user
experience.&nbsp; We are&nbsp; also looking at architectural
improvements and performance optimizations that will make plugin
updating faster and more reliable," said Brendan Eich, Chief Architect
of the Mozilla project.</p>

<p>
The new plugin API effort taps into a long standing, deeply rooted
desire by plugin vendors to have their plugins work more seamlessly for
all browsers and on all computing platforms, including Windows, Linux,
and Mac OS X.&nbsp; The enhanced plugin API has been collaboratively
developed to promote adoption by a broad set of browser and plugin
vendors, and will be made available under an open source license.</p>

<p>
"Apple is happy to have made a significant contribution to this next
generation plugin technology," said Philip Schiller, Apple's Senior
Vice President of Worldwide Product Marketing. "Apple is a strong
advocate for web standards and will ensure that Mac OS X Safari users
have access to the latest standards-based web technology."</p>

<p>
"Macromedia Flash Player is the leading rich client on the Internet,
and as a company we are committed to improving the end user
experience," said David Mendels, General Manager, Macromedia.
"Macromedia has always supported the Netscape Plugin API, and these
improvements will enable developers to deliver rich Internet
applications that integrate more holistically with the browser to
greatly benefit end users."</p>

<p>
"Plugins are a part of the web and it is critical that they interact
with browsers and other web content securely and efficiently.&nbsp;
Expanding the legacy plugin model from Netscape is a step in the right
direction with regard to functionality, interaction and security," said
Christen Krogh, VP Engineering, Opera Software. "Opera embraces this
initiative in its commitment to innovation and to always deliver the
latest technologies for an enjoyable web experience."</p>

<h3>LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE NEW PLUGIN
MODEL</h3>

<p>In the near future, the Mozilla Foundation will release test versions
of its next generation Firefox browser and of Mozilla 1.7 that include
the new plugin APIs, allowing plugin vendors to start creating new
versions of their plugins that take full advantage of the enhanced
plugin capabilities.&nbsp; Details on test builds with these new
capabilities, plugin SDKs, and web page scripting examples can be found
at 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/plugins/">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/plugins/</a>
as they become available.</p>

<p>
Web browsers capable of supporting the new plugin enhancements, and
plugins that take advantage of the new capabilities are expected to
ship this Fall.&nbsp; The plugin enhancements will be included, among
others, in future versions of Mozilla Firefox, the innovative new web
browser from the Mozilla Foundation.&nbsp; Even before its 1.0 release,
Firefox has been received to rave reviews by the press and end users
alike.&nbsp; The user base of Firefox is doubling every few months and
Firefox 0.9 has been downloaded more than 1 million times since its
release two weeks ago.</p>
