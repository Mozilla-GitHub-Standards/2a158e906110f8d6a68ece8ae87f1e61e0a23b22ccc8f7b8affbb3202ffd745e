<h1>Camino 0.9alpha1 Release Notes</h1>
<div id="bodyContent">
<div id="contentSub"> </div>
<!-- BEGIN content -->
<p>Camino 0.9 brings you a heavily updated version of the only native
OS X browser using Mozilla.org's Gecko HTML rendering engine. We made
great improvements in rendering accuracy and speed, bookmarks and
history management, preferences, plugin support, and many other areas.<br>
<br>
Due to changes in our feature set we can no longer support OS X 10.1,
we advise people still using OS X 10.1 to download Camino 0.8.4.<br>
</p>
<p>Note that Camino 0.9 is in the "alpha" stage, which means it is
still heavily under development. We feel that it is usable on a
day-to-day basis and a large improvement over Camino 0.8.4, but you may
still experience issues and functionality that doesn't work 100%. The
goal of this early release is to demonstrate the team's progress and
for people to report issues early on in the development cycle so they
can be addressed.<br>
</p>
<h2> Highlights </h2>
<ul>
  <li> This version contains a wide variety of optimizations, memory
usage improvements, leak fixes and performance improvements for page
rendering and scrolling, as well as numerous crash fixes.

  </li>

    <ul>
      <li> Allows more than 16 tabs in one window.
      </li>
      <li> Add an overflow widget when there are too many tabs (as
known from regular toolbars).
      </li>
      <li> Tabs are now left-aligned.
      </li>
      <li> Each tab now has a "close" widget.
      </li>

      </li>
      <li> The tab bar can be set to always be visible, even with only

      </li>
      <li> Re-arranged the tab contextual menu to be more logical.

tab or new window depending on preferences.
  </li>

  <li> The Help menu now contains an Installed Plugins item which opens
about:plugins.
  </li>

  </li>
  <li> We now use the language information in the System Preferences |
International panel to send data on what languages you understand to
websites (HTTP accept-language header).
  </li>
  <li> The new option camino.accept_languages can be used to specify a
set of languages to use for the HTTP accept-language header instead of
the ones determined from System Preferences.
  </li>
  <li> Support added for wallet.crypto.autocompleteoverride hidden
preference.
  </li>
  <li> We removed the preference ui for disabling plugins as it has
some major problems (specifically with javascript). This can be worked
around by using hidden preferences.
  </li>
  <li> The Navigation panel is renamed to General and is now one pane.
  </li>
  <li> We added a "New Folder" button to the Choose Download Folder
sheet.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> Localization bug fixes </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Cookie Allow and Deny buttons now localizable.
  </li>
  <li> Export button in the Bookmark export window now localizable.
  </li>
  <li> Loading indication for Preference panels now localizable.
  </li>
  <li> Unblock... popup indicator option now localizable.
  </li>
  <li> Localization of suggested bookmark export file name.
  </li>
  <li> We Localized the cookie editor yes/no values.
  </li>
  <li> We changed Rendezvous to Bonjour in line with Apples product
name change.
  </li>
  <li> We now make sure the downloads location in the download manager
is displayed using localized names.
  </li>
  <li> We fixed an issue where localized version of camino couldn't
change Monospaced font in Preferences.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> Java issues </h2>
<ul>
  <li> If you are running Mac OS X 10.1.5, you need to download the
MRJPlugin to run java applets.
  </li>
  <li> Typing and dragging in Java applets does not work correctly
using the java MRJPlugin.
  </li>
  <li> We advise every user on Mac OS X 10.2+ to use the Java Embedding
Plugin. This plugin solves all of the above Java issues and more.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> Known issues </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Due to a combination of several redraw issues in Gecko typing in
form fields can be very slow. Turning of GIF animations can in some
cases improve performance.
  </li>
  <li> By default Shockwave Director content displays at the wrong
location in the window, change hardware rendering to software rendering
to solve this.
  </li>
  <li> If you try to open Camino AppleScript dictionary, say from
Script Editor, you’ll get an error. To work around this, open the
application package, and remove the “Localized.rsrc” file in
Contents/Resources/English.lproj. This will, however, prevent Shockwave
Director content from loading so we recommend you do this on a copy of
the application.
  </li>
  <li> While the worst issues from 0.8 have been resolved, some issues
remain when typing in non-Roman languages.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> Known 10.3-only issues </h2>
<ul>
  <li> A bug in 10.3.0 - 10.3.3 causes text in IFRAMEs to "float"
outside the IFRAME as the window is resized and not repaint correctly
when scrolled. This has been fixed by Apple in 10.3.4.
  </li>
  <li> A bug in 10.3 can cause multiple bookmarks to appear on the
Bookmark Bar or Desktop when dragged from Camino. This has been fixed
in Mac OS X 10.4.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> Known 10.4-only issues </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Due to a bug in Apple's NSImage API some site icons are not
shown correctly. This will be fixed in an upcoming OS release.<br>
  </li>
