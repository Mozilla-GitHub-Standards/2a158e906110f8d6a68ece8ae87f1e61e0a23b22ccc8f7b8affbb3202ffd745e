  <p>Mozilla Thunderbird makes e-mailing safer, faster and easier than ever before with the industry's best implementations of features such as intelligent spam filters, a built-in spell checker, extension support and much more. </p>
  <h2>Your Productivity - Our Dedication</h2>
  <p>We designed Mozilla Thunderbird with your productivity in mind. That's why we've made it easier for you to simply get your work done, without the hassle of wading through advertisements and other junk mail. E-mailing should be pleasant and convenient. We make that possible, using fully open and industry leading standards. Read on to find out more about the reasons why you should use Mozilla Thunderbird as your mail and news client.</p>

<h3 class="firstRow">Smartest Way to Stop Junk Mail</h3>
<div class="screenshot-right" style="width: 260px"><img src="feat_junkmail.png" alt="Screenshot of Mozilla Thunderbird" />
<p>Mozilla Thunderbird removes spam and helps keep your Inbox clean.</p></div>
<p>Tired of spam and annoying advertising in your Inbox? Mozilla Thunderbird provides the most effective tools for detecting junk mail. Our tools analyze your e-mail and identify those that are most likely to be junk. You can have your junk mail automatically deleted or put in a specific folder.</p>
<p>To activate the Junk Mail filters, go to <span class="mnu">Tools > Junk Mail Controls...</span>, click the Adaptive Filters tab and check the <span class="checkboxon">Enable adaptive junk mail detection</span> option.</p>

<h3 class="clear">Mail, the Way <em>You</em> Want It</h3>
<div class="screenshot-left" style="width: 207px"><img src="feat_layout.png" alt="Screenshot of Mozilla Thunderbird" />
<p>We've added a new three-column view to access your e-mail.</p></div>
<p>View your e-mail the way you want it. Choose between three unique message views. Select your toolbar layout. Customize your toolbar buttons, and use Mail Views to quickly sort through your e-mail.</p>
<p>In the end, all these possibilities make you more productive and efficient, which is what Mozilla Thunderbird is all about.</p>



<h3 class="clear">Built-in Spell Checking</h3>
<div class="screenshot-right" style="width: 182px"><img src="feat_spell.png" alt="Screenshot of Mozilla Thunderbird" />
<p>The intelligent spell checker keeps your mail professional.</p></div>
<p>There's no need for third party spell checking software. Mozilla Thunderbird comes with an integrated spell checker developed by the <a href="http://spellchecker.mozdev.org/">Spellchecker Mozdev Project</a>. All you need to do is to click on the Spell button in the toolbar, and Mozilla Thunderbird will do the work for you.</p>
                	
<h3>Safe and Secure</h3>
<p>Mozilla Thunderbird provides enterprise and government grade security features such as S/MIME, digital signing, message encryption, support for certificates and security devices.</p>
<p>Unlike many other products, Mozilla Thunderbird doesn't allow scripts to run by default. This results in a more secure product than other mail clients on the market and helps stop the spreading of worms and viruses on the Web.</p>

<h3 class="firstRow">Unlimited Functionality through Extensions</h3>
<div class="screenshot-left" style="width: 14ex"><img src="feat_extensions.png" alt="Screenshot of Extension icon" />
<p>How powerful do you want your mail client? <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/?application=thunderbird">You decide!</a></p></div>


<p>Mozilla Thunderbird is already packed with great features like IMAP/POP support, support for HTML mail, labels, quick search, a smart address book, return receipts, advanced message filtering, LDAP address completion, import tools, powerful search, and the ability to manage multiple e-mail and newsgroup accounts.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Mozilla Thunderbird lets you add additional features as you need them through extensions. Extensions are powerful tools to help you build a mail client that meets your specific needs. Take a look at the various <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/?application=thunderbird">extensions available</a>.</p>


<h3>Integrated News Reader</h3>
<p>Mozilla Thunderbird is not just a mail client, it also includes a fully-integrated Usenet newsgroup reader! It supports all the basic functions, such as subscribing to your favorite newsgroups, downloading headers and messages, offline support and thread watching/ignoring. </p>


<h3>Personalize with Themes</h3>
<div class="screenshot-right" style="width: 190px"><img src="feat_themes.png" alt="Screenshot of Mozilla Thunderbird Qute theme" />
<p>Just about any part of the interface can be changed with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/themes/?application=thunderbird">themes</a>.</p></div>


<p>With themes, you can change the look and feel of Mozilla Thunderbird. A theme
   can simply change the toolbar icons or it can change every piece of the
   application appearance. You can <a href=
   "https://addons.mozilla.org/themes/?application=thunderbird">download and
   install themes</a> with just a few clicks.</p>


<h3>Cross-Platform Technology</h3>
<p>Windows, Linux or Macintosh? Regardless of your choice of operating system, Mozilla Thunderbird is available for you. It currently runs on Windows 95, 98, Me, 2000 and XP, as well as Linux, Mac OS X, OS/2 and Solaris.</p>


<h3>Absolutely Free</h3>
<p>The <a href="/">Mozilla Foundation</a> makes Free software, also known as open-source software. This means that you can use it without restrictions, even for corporate use. In fact, even the source code is available for you to look at.</p>
<p>In other words, you do what you want with Mozilla Thunderbird. It's <a href="../">yours</a> to keep!</p>
