<h1>Modifying Mozilla Address Book Code</h1>

<p>This document explains the process underway to modify the existing code of 
the Mozilla address book to enable support many types of address book.</p>

<p>Currently the address book implementation only supports one type of address 
book which utilizes the Mork database infrastructure for storage of address 
book data. Functionality associated with database is reflected in the design 
and implementation of address book interfaces, components implementing the 
interfaces and clients, such as the java script, which use the components.</p>

<p>The address book interfaces and component framework needs to be redesigned 
such that it is not dependent on one particular implementation of a specific 
address book type.</p>

<p>Concentration has currently been focused on two key areas:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Address book directory</li>
 <li>Address book card</li>
</ol>

<p>which relate to the content of an address book that are composed of:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>RDF datasource</dt>
 <dd>
  Consists of statements or assertions relating resources to each other via 
  an arc or semantic link (can be considered a property).
 </dd>
 <dt>RDF resources</dt>
 <dd>Uniquely defined by a URI. RDF resources are instantiated items of content.</dd>

 <dt>Specific interfaces corresponding to content, and implementations of</dt>
 <dd>
  An RDF resource implements specific interfaces associated with the content 
  the resource represent. Thus an RDF datasource can perform specific operations 
  on a resource to define statements.
 </dd>
</dl>

<p>These correspond to three XPCOM components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RDF datasource component</li>

  <li>RDF resource component</li>
  <li>Specific property component</li>
</ul>

<h2>Card</h2>

<p>If we concentrate on the Address book card area there is an:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Card RDF datasource XPCOM component</dt>

 <dd>Instantiating class: <code>nsAbCardDataSource</code>
 <dd>Registry string: <code>@mozilla.org/rdf/datasource;1?name=addresscard</code></dd>
 <dt>Card RDF resource XPCOM component</dt>
 <dd>Instantiating class: <code>nsAbCard</code>
 <dd>Registry string: <code>@mozilla.org/rdf/resource-factory;1?name=abcard</code></dd>

 <dt>Card property XPCOM component</dt>
 <dd>Instantiating class: <code>nsAbCardProperty</code></dd>
 <dd>Registry string: <code>@mozilla.org/addressbook/cardproperty;1</code></dd>
</dl>

<p>When examining the address book code it became apparent that the latter 
two parts of content required a closer look. The structure of these components 
are closely related as can be seen when looking at the class diagram:</p>

<p><img src="sv010011.gif" alt="Graphic1" width="442" height="473"></p>

<p>The components are identified by the note underneath the class, which 
presents the registry name. The card property component is instantiated 
when a new card is created which is then 'inserted' in the directory. The 
card is not associated with an RDF resource until it is 'inserted'.</p>

<p>On the left had side is the path to the <code>nsIRDFResource</code>
interface and on the right is the path to the specific <code>nsIAbCard</code>
interface. The latter has specific attributes and methods.</p>

<p>It immediately becomes apparent that the left hand side structure
contains specifics about data bases because of the <code>nsIAddrDBListener</code>
inteface. A Card RDF resource component listens to the corresponding
database, defined by the <code>nsIAddrDatabase</code> interface, where 
the card is stored so that the component may update if changes occur.</p>

<p>On the right hand side the <code>nsAbCardProperty</code> class 
implements all the methods and attributes associated with the
<code>nsIAbCard</code> interface. The <code>nsIAbCard</code> interface 
contains attributes and methods specific to data base functionality:</p>

<dl>
 <dd><code>readonly attribute unsigned long key;</code></dd>

 <dd><code>void setRecordKey(in unsigned long key);</code></dd>
 <dd><code>attribute unsigned long dbTableID;</code></dd>
 <dd><code>attribute unsigned long dbRowID;</code></dd>
 <dd><code>void setAbDatabase(in nsIAddrDatabase database);</code></dd>
 <dd><code>void copyCard(in nsIAbCard srcCard);</code></dd>
 <dd><code>readonly attribute string cardURI;</code></dd>

</dl>

<p>For different address book types it should be necessary that:</p>

<ol>
 <li>
  An instantiated card property component is independent of the address 
  book implementation
 </li>
 <li>
  Address book implementations should not have to deal to data base 
  specific methods which may not not have any relation to how the
  implementation behaves
 </li>
</ol>

<p>It was decided that the right hand side required 'refactoring' into 
general and specific attributes and methods:</p>

<p><img src="sv010013.gif" alt="Graphic2" width="360" height="381"></p>

<p>Specific methods from the original <code>nsIAbCard</code> interface were 
moved to a new interface called <code>nsIAbDBCard</code> interface. 
Implementing methods were then moved accordingly. The
<code>nsAbCardProperty</code> class implements some methods associated with 
the <code>nsIAbCard</code> interface. This is now defined to be the card 
property component and is capable of supporting all the required 
functionality for creating a new card via the Javacript and XUL GUI.</p>

<p>Specific database methods are now implemented by the 
<code>nsAbDBCardProperty</code> class. The <code>nsAbDBCard</code> class 
contains the same content as the previous <code>nsAbCard</code> class and 
the implementation of the <code>nsIRDFResource</code> interface has not changed.</p>

<p>Only the registry string has changed from <code>?name=abcard</code>

to <code>?name=abcardmdb</code>. The implications of this are that every 
database card RDF resource component instantiate will have a URI scheme 
<code>abcardmdb</code>. An example URI may look like 
<code>abcardmdb://abook.mab/Card1</code>. Thus cards originating from the 
Mozilla address book database are uniquely defined as before.</p>

<p>The consequences of the 'refactoring' are perhaps not as simplistic as 
previously described. It was necessary to add a new attribute to the 
<code>nsIAbCard</code> interface for mail list support and modify some 
other existing interfaces to support the functionality to add a new card to 
a directory. In addition code which depended on specific methods in the old 
<code>nsIAbCard</code> interface required modifiction to query the component 
for the <code>nsIAbDBCard</code> interface. Since this was only required by 
code related to database functionality this operation was guaranteed to be 
successful.</p>

<p>Overall the 'refactoring' resulted in minimal changes to existing code and 
its functionality. No changes were required to the corresponding data source.</p>

<p>Given the new arrangement it is easy to represent cards associated with 
the LDAP star web top address book:</p>

<p><img src="sv010015.gif" alt="Graphic3" width="385" height="381"></p>

<p>The same pattern as before is literally copied. However, it may not be 
necessary to be as exact. There may be no need for the 
<code>nsAbLDAPSWTCardProperty</code> class or a specific card interface 
<code>nsIAbLDAPSWTCard</code>. It is a requirement that the 
<code>nsAbLDAPSWTCard</code> class implement the <code>nsIRDFResource</code> 

interface, via inheritance of the <code>nsRDFResource</code> class, and 
that it has a uniquely defined registry name conforming to the RDF resource 
factory schema. In this case all LDAP SWT card RDF resource components will 
have a URI scheme of <code>abcardldapswt</code>.</p>

<h2>Directory</h2>

<p>The same pattern for 'refactoring' the card may be applied to the directory 
component framework. This is currently underway such that it should 
straightforward to implement different directory implementations without 
needing different RDF directory data sources.</p>

<h2>Managing multiple address book types</h2>

<p>Once the framework is in place for managing multiple address book types 
it is necessary to instantiate address books from preferences, create new 
address books and delete address books (updating the preferences). This 
currently assumes that an address book, which corresponds to an directory 
RDF resource is of a singular type <code>abdirectory</code>, now that there
are multiple types, for example <code>abdirectorymdb</code> and 
<code>abdirectoryldapswt</code>, it is necessary to change the previous 
behaviour.</p>

<p>The code associated with the directory component manages the instantiation 
of address books and preferences. This code needs to be moved into a new 
directory component in the new framework. This component will use the existing 
<code>abdirectory</code> URI scheme. This is like a boot strap component with 
limited functionality and only makes sense when instantiate with a URI of
<code>abdirectory://</code>. In XUL files RDF data sources are bound to an RDF 
resource to obtain an entry into the graph of statements. Since the URI scheme 
has not changed the XUL needs no modification.</p>

<p>For the instantiation of address books there appears to be a requirement 
for each directory type to have a corresponding factory component that has a 
singular create method and takes a set of properties as a parameter. This 
then disassociates how the preferences are stored from the address book. 
Currently they are quite tightly bound.</p>

<p>There is a requirement to ensure that the existing method of storing 
preferences is suitable for future implementations of address books.</p>

<p>Each address book type may require a separate GUI dialog to allow the user 
to create a new address book of that type.</p>

<h2>LDAP address books</h2>

<p>Two types of LDAP address book have been identified:</p>

<ol>

 <li>
  Star Webtop LDAP address book<br>
  Behaviour wise this is equivalent to local address books and corresponds 
  to a users personal address book.
 </li>
 <li>
  Personnel LDAP address book<br>
  Behaviour wise this is equivalent to Netscape 4.x LDAP address books. A 
  query based approach is required to efficiently return a constrained 
  sub-set of address book cards.
 </li>
</ol>

<p>It is considered that the former can easily be integrated into the redesigned 
framework, albeit with some possible inefficiencies which are related to auto 
completion of email addresses. These inefficiencies relate to how the address 
book is queried. Thus it appears that both require some additional interface 
for query support.</p>

<p>The latter will require more changes to the environment to support GUI based 
queries. However, the concept of a directory and card need not change, so it 
should be possible to drag a card from a personnel address book into a personal 
address book. Additional attributes will need to be added to the directory to 
indicate query and read only operations.</p>

<p>Both require LDAP client code to communicate the LDAP protocol. Mozilla 
contains an LDAP C SDK and corresponding XPCOM components which use this SDK. 
The LDAP address book implementations should ideally use the XPCOM components. 
It needs to be ensured that these meet the requirements.</p>

<p>Note that the Star Webtop LDAP address book is of a higher priority. The 
changes to the existing framework will enable easier integration of the 
personnel LDAP address book. It does not imply that the engineers on the 
address book project will implement this address book type.</p>

<h2>Multiple data sources</h2>

<p>It remains to be seen if there are any caveats to the approach of having 
mulitple data resource types and a singular data source. The only concern of 
current note is the efficient use of the directory interfaces by the singular 
data source. If this becomes a problem it should be possible to extend 
components to support additional functionality and:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  modify the singular data source to support multiple directory
  functionality.
 </li>
 <li>
  create new directory data sources for specific address book types which 
  conform to the existing directory data source schema. A top level composite 
  data source will be required to aggregate the multiple data sources.
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>Multiple sub-directories</h2>

<p>Currently the hierarchy of the address book structure is limited to a 
maximum depth of three:</p>

<ol>
 <li>multiple address books</li>
 <li>address book</li>
 <li>mail list</li> 
</ol>

<p>This may require extending to one more depth to support the concept of 
address book folders. Otherwise multiple address books of the same type 
will have to be instantiated which represent each folder.</p>

<p>It is uncertain what modification are required to the address book to 
support this behaviour. However a 'mail list' is a sub directory of a 
certain type, so it should be possible (theoretically) to support 
sub-directories that are not mail lists.</p>

<h2>Plan</h2>
<h3>Framework</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Refactor directory framework to enable multiple directory implementations.</li>
 <li>
  Refactor modified directory framework to enable boot strap component. All 
  preference saving code will be in here.
 </li>

 <li>
  Modify bootstrap component to instantiate address book types from 
  corresponding factory components. This ensures that directory implementations 
  are de-coupled from the preferences. This will require modification to the 
  <code>nsIAbDirectory</code> interface to remove some associated attributes 
  and methods.
 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Star Webtop LDAP address book</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Ensure that LDAP C SDK and XPCOM components are suitable</li>

 <li>
  Decide on <code>vCard</code> or <code>inetOrgPerson</code> schema to be 
  used in the LDAP server. Mozilla uses a similar schema to 
  <code>inetOrgPerson</code>. I would prefer if <code>vCard</code> was 
  used throughout the Mozilla address book framework, however this will 
  result in many changes to code. Thus for now it is better to leave it 
  as is. This implies, from a developer perspective, that it would be 
  better for the LDAP server to use <code>inetOrgPerson</code> since it 
  is simpler for the LDAP address components to directly map the attributes.
 </li>

 <li>Implement read only functionality</li>
 <li>Implement update functionality, delete and new.</li>
 <li>
  Implement mail list functionality. This may require additional schema 
  in the LDAP directory.
 </li>
</ul>
