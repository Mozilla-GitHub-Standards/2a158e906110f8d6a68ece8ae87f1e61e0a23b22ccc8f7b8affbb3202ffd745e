  <h1>unity of interface</h1>

  <address class="author">
   by <a href="mailto:jwz@mozilla.org">Jamie Zawinski</a>
  </address>

  <p>If one must pick one thing as being the core concept and greatest strength
  of the "web browser" as we know it today, it is this:</p>

  <p style="border: silver medium solid; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;
  width: 70%; padding: 1em;">The same interface for the same task, regardless of
  how the service is implemented on the other end.</p>

  <p>Short of being cross-platform (which deserves a document of its own)
  Mozilla's greatest strength is that it manages to provide a unified interface
  to a number of useful services and protocols.</p>

  <h2>It is more interesting to support a concept than to support a particular
  implementation of it.</h2>

  <p>For example, document retrieval works the same way regardless of the
  underlying protocols used, be they HTTP, FTP, Gopher... The important detail
  is the act of clicking on a link, and getting a document back. All else is
  implementation detail, and of no interest to the end user.</p>

  <p>Likewise, the Mozilla mail reader behaves the same way regardless of where
  the messages are stored (on the local disk, or on an IMAP server.) And the
  user interfaces for the Mozilla mail reader and news reader are very similar
  because they are very similar tasks: management and retrieval of messages.
  They differ in certain specifics, but the concepts are largely the same, and
  therefore, the interfaces are largely the same.</p>

  <p>As support for new protocols is added to Mozilla in the future, such
  support should follow this same model: when there are two protocols that do
  similar things, Mozilla should support a common interface for each.</p>

  <h2>How do you write software that supports a general concept?</h2>

  <p>First by cataloging the various features of the specific protocols that
  exist, and deciding what the most important overlapping concepts are. Then,
  you try and build an interface that does all the important stuff the same
  way, and (hopefully) allows the protocol- specific features to show through
  when they are available.</p>

  <p>FTP, HTTP, and Gopher have disjoint sets of features, but Mozilla supports
  each of these protocols. It doesn't support them all <em>fully</em>; there
  are a number of commands that a command-line ftp client supports that aren't
  accessible from Mozilla; but the basics are there. And 99.5% of the time,
  it's good enough.</p>

  <p>Mail and News are another example of the same thing; there are some very
  mail- specific concepts, like deletion; some very news- specific concepts
  cancelling; and some concepts that are pretty-much the same if you look at
  them right, like the various reply options, and subscription, and
  kill files / filters.</p>

  <p>Note that the important detail here is not reuse of <em>code</em>, but
  rather, reuse of <em>interface</em>: there's a good chance that there won't
  be much code sharing between the implementation of various protocols (HTTP
  and FTP share very little code, for example, since their on- the- wire
  protocols are radically different) but that doesn't mean that, in so far as
  they have <em>conceptual</em> similarities, they shouldn't present themselves
  to the user in a similar way.</p>

  <p>Some people argue that when you try and make one program that does many
  things, you often end up with a program that doesn't do any of them
  perfectly.</p>

  <p>I reject that argument, because the goal is to let the user accomplish
  what they want to accomplish: not to produce the perfect implementation of a
  particular protocol. The latter may be a means to the former end, but that's
  all.</p>

  <p>And, I believe that a program that does many things to the 70th percentile
  beats hands down a program that does one thing perfectly; and also beats
  hands down a suite of programs that all do one thing perfectly, but that each
  do so with totally different interfaces that must be learned afresh for each
  task.</p>

  <h2>A specific example: chat.</h2>

  <p>For the sake of argument, I propose that Mozilla should include a "chat"
  client. And, following the thesis presented above, that Mozilla should
  support various chat protocols in an abstract way.</p>

  <p>It seems clear that chat systems like IRC and ICQ (and the AOL chat rooms,
  and, to some extent, certain MUDs/MOOs) are similar enough that one could
  come up with an interface to each of them that makes sense for each: they all
  incorporate line- at- a- time communication among (potentially) large numbers
  of people. They each have concepts of "rooms" and "private messages" and so
  forth.</p>

  <p>However, let's also consider a harder example: could we come up with an
  interface that worked for both IRC/AOL- style chat systems, and also for a
  more different system, the Unix "talk" protocol?</p>

  <p>Let's imagine that we have a UI with the general form of: a big text area
  in which the various typed comments of the participants appear; a text-entry
  area at the bottom; and a toolbar. Let's imagine that some of the commands
  available are concepts that are not available on all chat systems, like
  "change channel" or "change handle" or "upload GIF." Well, if the current
  protocol doesn't support it, the command would be disabled. (Or perhaps the
  set of commands on the toolbar would be slightly different, depending on the
  protocol being used.)</p>

  <p>Current implentations of the Unix "talk" protocol are unbuffered, one-
  character- at- a- time systems in which the participants can see each other
  typing, including deletions, as they happen.</p>

  <p>I <em>think</em> that most other chat systems are line- at- a- time, or
  otherwise pre-editable. Assuming that this is the case, this would suggest
  that that the right thing to do, in the "talk" implementation, is to make it
  do pre-editing as well: that is, when using the Mozilla chat client to speak
  the "talk" protocol, characters would not be sent until the user hit return;
  and likewise, the text from the person on the other end would be presented
  one line at a time (or when the other person stopped typing for a second or
  two, or something along those lines.)</p>

  <p>This would mean that if one person was using the Mozilla chat client, and
  another person was using the classic Unix "talk" command, they would have
  rather different UI experiences than they would have if they were both using
  the same client. However, that is no different than the case of two people
  exchanging email using radically different mail readers: they each have their
  preferred interfaces, but communicate via common protocols.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion: tools versus protocols.</h2>

  <p>The important thing to keep in mind when trying stuff like this is that at
  some level, "chat" is a <em>concept</em>, like "document retrieval" or
  "message handling," and what you're trying to do is build a useful
  <em>tool</em> on top of those protocols that can interoperate with other
  tools that also happen to speak those protocols.</p>

  <p>You are <em>not</em> necessarily trying to clone the user interface of
  those other, pre-existing tools.</p>
