<h2>
Web Applications - A Thicker Client Model</h2>
A web application can very generally be defined as consisting of a consumer
requesting data or services from a producer. While it isn't necessary that
the consumer be browser-based, most existing web applications, ranging
from <a href="http://www.amazon.com">consumer e-commerce applications</a>
to <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">development tools</a> to <a href="http://www.desktop.com">alternatives
to standard desktop services</a>, consist of a thin, largely stateless
client communicating over a HTTP pipe to a server managing the session,
in turn connected to a back-end data source. The model for data transfer
and state management is strongly dictated by the constraints of both the
client container and the pipeline. Specifically, the inability to store
structured application state on the client and the request-response page
delivery paradigm disallow web applications authors from making standard
efficiency and resource management tradeoffs.
<p>For existing web applications, where the consumer is browser-based,
some of the drawbacks include:
<ol>
<li>
Most content sent from the server to the client is presentational. While
the promise of XML is a strong separation of data from presentation, current
client implementations of XML still maintain a fairly strong tie between
the two. Direct application of CSS to XML still places strong presentational
semantics on the data. Arbitrary transformation of an XML document via
a transformation language such as XSL does allow for a larger separation
between data and presentation, as does embedded XML data within a presentational
container such as HTML. However, both still work under a model where data
is largely sent as part of and for the sole purpose of driving presentation.</li>

<li>
Little state is maintained on the client side between pages in an application.
The lack of a mechanism to persist structured application data on the client
forces web applications to store state on the server. This can result in
retransmission of data for each page in an application. Both server side
storage of state and retransmission have obvious impact on issues of scalability.</li>

<li>
The request-response model currently equates client requests for data (via
HTTP GET) and client submission of data (via HTTP POST) with a page change
and, consequently, a state change. Furthermore, posting of data is only
achieved through the narrow mechanism of form submission. This places strong
restrictions on the control and data flow of the web application and mandates
a very specific user interaction model.</li>

<li>
Since most presentational decisions are made before a web application even
gets to the client, there is little scope for scaling the presentation
to match the capabilities of the client. In a heterogeneous environment,
with client devices of varying capabilities, the current model only allows
scaling to occur at the presentational level e.g. proxy-based conversion
of HTML to WML. A more powerful model would be one that not only allows
presentational decisions to be made on the client (or on a dedicated proxy),
but also allows for scaling of the data pulled from the server, based on
the needs of the client.</li>

<li>
The current model generally ties an application to a specific host server.
Not only does the single server have to maintain session state, it is generally
the source of all data received by the client. This precludes a model where
a client may request and combine data from various, possibly disparate
data sources.</li>
</ol>
This document describes an application model that allows greater flexibility
in structuring the logic and data associated with a web application. While
specifics of the model may be described in the context of a browser-based
consumer, the concepts may be applied to a more generic notion of a web
application. Specifically, the basic model may also be applied in a case
where the consumer does not have a presentation associated with it (e.g.
the consumer may reside on one server and request services from another
server).
<h4>
The Model</h4>
<img SRC="webapp.gif" height=459 width=708>
<p>A web application can be thought of as any stateful consumer of data.
It has the following features:
<ul>
<li>
It can arbitrarily request data from one or more producers or services
and can asynchronously receive a response. Note that a request for data
may itself contain data posted by the consumer.</li>

<li>
It can store application state (either code or data) for the duration of
its life. This state storage is not required to be correlated with requests
for data.</li>

<li>
It may, but is not required to, have a presentation associated with it.</li>
</ul>
For most existing web applications, when viewed in the context of this
model, the stateful consumer of data lies on a server (the server is the
<i>application
container</i>). It requests data from one or more producers of data, most
often server-side business logic components connected to back-end databases.
It communicates presentational data, generally in the form of HTML, to
a presentational component which resides on the client. Events, such as
form posts or link activations, are posted back to the consumer. It maintains
state across the duration of a session, often sending elements of that
state to the presentation.
<p>This document describes a set of features that allow greater flexibility
in the positioning of the client-server boundary for a web application.
Specifically, the stateful consumer of data should be an entity that may
be implemented completely on a web client or split between client and server
- the application container can be the client or live on both sides of
the client-server boundary. With these features, a browser-based consumer
will be able to do the following:
<ul>
<li>
Make asynchronous requests for data that are not tied to a presentation
change. The data requests and responses will travel over HTTP, but may
be either free-form XML data exchanges or more structured and typed RPC
calls.</li>

<li>
Build and manipulate presentation using the DOM and/or more declarative
style mechanisms.</li>

<li>
Respond to user events and manipulate application state based on these
interactions using the DOM event model.</li>

<li>
Post data asynchronously to a server, again not necessarily tying the data
exchange to a presentation change.</li>

<li>
Save state across presentational changes (or persistently across sessions
of the applications) using a mechanism similar to cookies, but for more
structured XML data.</li>

<li>
Provide a manifest that describes the lifetime of the application, allowing
the browser to maintain code lifetime across multiple pages.</li>
</ul>
Note again that many of these features can also be applied to an application
without a presentation and can be generalized to an application that doesn't
necessarily reside on a browser.
<h4>
XML Data Pipe</h4>
Any web application should be able to exchange data with a data producer
or service. The request for data can take one of the following forms:
<ul>
<li>
An asynchronous request for the contents of a URL where the returned data
is treated as an XML stream. The result of the request is handed back to
the consumer as a DOM document. There are no constraints on the XML that
comes across the pipe - it can represent data of an arbitrary schema. The
request is in the form of an HTTP GET operation.</li>

<li>
A variant of this allows the consumer to provide a DOM document or fragment
as part of the request. The HTTP transaction is now in the form of a POST
and the serialized version of the XML document or fragment is part of the
body of the HTTP transaction.</li>

<li>
The request can be in the form of a RPC call. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/">SOAP</a>
lays the groundwork for specifying the contents of the HTTP packet that
is sent across the pipe. In the generic case, the RPC call can be synchronous
or asynchronous, though depending on the threading model of the host container,
only one option may be viable.</li>

<li>
[In the long run, we may want to allow handling of the request and the
response to be pluggable at multiple levels. Specifically, the application
may want to interact directly at the protocol level or above it, dealing
with the body of the request as a stream, string or DOM document. Conceptually
this is already possible in Mozilla - a signed script may already register
a protocol handler or provide a stream listener for a URL load.]</li>
</ul>
In the context of a browser-based application, the script-driven requests
for data should be independent of any presentational changes. Specifically,
the browser container does not treat the result of the request as the contents
of a new page. The following API additions will need to be made:
<ul>
<li>
A programmatic way of triggering an asynchronous URL load. The load request
will include a handler which is invoked when the load is complete. A parameter
to the handler will be the result of the request in the form of a DOM document.
A variant of the load call would also allow posting of XML data, again
in the form of a DOM Document. 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Requirements/#Level3">DOM
Level 3</a> will include a set of interfaces to deal with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Requirements/#Level-3-LS-Requirements">loading
and saving</a> of documents and may be the source of an API to trigger
such a load.</li>

<br>Both IE and Mozilla currently have non-standard mechanisms for loading
XML data via script. IE provides ways of both <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/xmlsdk/xmld2uck.htm">loading</a>
and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/xmlsdk/xmld8bp0.htm">posting</a>
XML documents using a URL, as well as mechanisms for invoking an XML parser
using a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/xmlsdk/xmld1nho.htm">string</a>.
Mozilla now has a mechanism for just <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/390D2B8A.6B6932D7%40netscape.com">loading</a>
XML documents.
<li>
A mechanism through which a SOAP-based RPC call can be made. In the absence
of a standard IDL representation of the object being invoked (note that
IBM has proposed an <a href="http://apps.alphaworks.ibm.com/technologies/soap4j/xidl.html">XML-based
IDL language</a>), the RPC call would need to be made in a fairly generic
manner i.e. through a generic call object as opposed to&nbsp; a complete
representation of the server-side object. A SOAP implementation that uses
such a generic calling scheme (including argument marshalling and basic
object serialization) exists for <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/soap4j">Java</a>
and one will undoubtedly exist for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/periodic/period00/soap.htm">COM</a>
clients. In Mozilla, a JavaScript implementation of a similar XML-RPC scheme
was <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/87g0rwi87t.fsf%40zopatista.com">recently
submitted</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
State Management</h4>
The page-based content delivery paradigm used in browsers makes state management
a problem for web applications because:
<ul>
<li>
Code (scripts or Java applets) on a page is unloaded when the next page
is delivered. The only mechanism for maintaining client-side state for
the lifetime of a web application instance is string-based cookies. As
a result, most session state for existing applications is maintained on
the server.</li>

<li>
There is no notification to the server-side maintainer of state of when
the client leaves the web application. In other words, the boundaries of
the web application are not strongly defined. As a result, session state
often needs to be maintained for significantly longer than is actually
necessary.</li>
</ul>
A persistence mechanism for XML data would alleviate some of these problems.
The mechanism would be similar to cookies in that the web application could
programmatically save and retrieve data, using the domain of the application
URL and an application-specified string as the key. The stored data would
be saved and retrieved in the form of a DOM document and could either be
kept in its in-memory form or serialized to disk, depending on the duration
of storage. A page-based application would then be able to store structured
application data on the client, even though its code was unloaded between
pages. (Note that IE5 includes a similar <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/Author/persistence/overview.asp">persistence
mechanism</a>.)
<p>With the features described in the previous section, a browser-resident
web application does not have to be page based. Since it can request data
and change presentation at any point, its entire lifetime can be bounded
by a single browser page. A single-paged application can also persist structured
data or post data back to a server-resident component when it is unloaded.
<p>HTML framesets can currently be used to allow a web application to have
resident code across multiple browser pages. The resident code is contained
in a single frame of the frameset, while paged components of the application
are contained in one or more other frames. These presentational pages can
be used as templates, filled in with application data from the resident
frame during or after initial page construction - in some sense, ASPs on
the client-side. In this way, an application can still use a paged user
interaction model, while maintaining the code lifetime characterstics of
a single-paged application.
<p>The ability of an application to have client-resident code for the duration
of its life could be formalized in a manner that doesn't require the use
of HTML frames (and could be applied to code written in either a scripting
language or Java). One possibility is for the application to provide a
manifest when it is downloaded. The manifest would contain both a reference
to the code that would be resident and a list of URLs or a domain across
which the code would remain resident. The application would be able to
register for load and unload events for both itself and the individual
pages within its manifest. The URLs in the manifest would be allowed under
the same security constraints as cross-frame script access for existing
applications. Code contained within the individual pages of the application
would be able to address the resident code and the resident code would
have access to the DOM document representing the page. [The manifest could
also hold XML-based IDL for any server-side objects visible to the application.]
<h4>
Related XML Standards</h4>
The implementation of several existing standards, while not strictly necessary,
would make application development in this model substantially easier.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a> - An application can create
or modify a presentation based on data received over the XML data pipe
by using the DOM to both traverse the document representing the data and
modify the document representing the presentation. While this programmatic
transformation of data to presentation is very flexible, the ability to
apply an XSL transform to all or part of the data document can simplify
the construction of the presentational tree. XSL transforms can also be
used to convert end-user specified presentational information back into
a schema that can be stored or posted.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath</a> - XPath provides a way of
querying and addressing elements of a data document that can be more powerful
than those available in the DOM core.</li>

<li>
XForms - The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms-datamodel/">XForms Working
Draft</a> describes a way of specifying a data model for form posting,
as well as a mechanism for binding presentational element values back to
the data model.</li>
</ul>
