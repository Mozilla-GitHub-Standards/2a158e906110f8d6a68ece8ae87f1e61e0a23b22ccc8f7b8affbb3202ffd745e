 <h1>our mission</h1>
 <p>Netscape Communications made two important announcements on January 
  23rd, 1998:
 <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease560.html">First</a>,
  that the Netscape Communicator product would be available free of
  charge;
  <li><a href="http://www.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html">Second</A>,
   that the source code for Communicator would also be free.
 </ul>
 <p>On March 31st, the first developer release of the source code to
  Communicator was made available.
 <p>But what now? For the product to grow and mature and continue to
  be useful and innovative, the various changes made by disparate
  developers across the web must be collated, organized, and brought
  together as a cohesive whole.
 <h1>Mozilla</h1>
 <p><q>Mozilla</q> was the original code name for the product that
  came to be known as Netscape Navigator, and later, Netscape
  Communicator.
 <p>Later, it came to be the name of Netscape Communications
  Corporation's dinosaur-like
  <a href="http://www.snafu.de/~tilman/mozilla/">mascot</a>.
 <p>Netscape Communications Corporation holds trademarks on the
  names Netscape, Navigator, and Communicator; it has not yet been 
  decided what, if any, restrictions Netscape will place on the use 
  of those names. 
 <p>Now, we use the name &quot;Mozilla&quot; as the principal trademark representing the Foundation and the official releases of internet client software developed through our open source project.

 <h2>mozilla.org</h2>
 <p><strong>mozilla.org</strong> is a group chartered to act as the
  virtual meeting place for the Mozilla code. That group is overseen
  by the <a href="foundation/">Mozilla Foundation</a>. We will provide
  a central point of contact and community for those interested in
  using or improving the source code:
 <ul>
  <li>We will provide technical and architectural direction for the
   project.
  <li>We will collect changes, help authors synchronize their work, and
   periodically make new source releases which incorporate the best work of
   the net as a whole.
  <li>We will operate discussion forums (mailing lists, newsgroups, or
   whatever seems most appropriate.)
  <li>We will coordinate bug lists, keep track of and publicize works
   in progress, and generally attempt to provide "roadmaps" to the
   code, and to projects based on the code.
  <li>And we will, above all, be flexible and responsive. We realize 
   that if we are not perceived as providing a useful service, we will 
   become irrelevant, and someone else will take our place.
  <li>
   <p>We are <strong class="stronger">not</strong> the primary coders. 
    Most of the code that goes into the distribution will be written
    elsewhere, both within the Netscape Client Engineering group, and,
    increasingly, <em>out there</em> on the net, at other companies and
    other development organizations.
   <p>We are code integrators. And, through our forums, we will try to
    help people reach consensus, and thereby provide direction and
    coordination for future improvements.
 </ul>
 <p>It can be observed that all successful open-source software projects
  follow this model of distributed development and centralized
  integration. One of the fears that open-source software software
  neophytes often express is that open availability of the source will
  lead to balkanization, that  there will eventually be thousands of
  different descendants of the original software, and confusion and chaos
  will result.  But, in reality that doesn't happen; organizations like 
  mozilla.org tend to appear. Eric Raymond tries to explain why in his 
  excellent paper,
  <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">The
  Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>. We hope to operate in the "Bazaar"
  style, and be to the public Netscape source code as Linus Torvalds is
  to Linux.
 <h1>How we operate</h1>
 <p> As explained earlier, those of us here at mozilla.org are not the
  primary coders of the Mozilla web browser. We function as a
  switchboard, facilitating the cooperation of the thousands of 
  participants out on the net. And we assemble the fruit of that labor
  in one place.
 <p>The real work gets done by people like you.
 <h2>Contributors</h2>
 <p>How can you participate? Simply by doing so! We believe in <q>deeds,
  not words</q>. We operate as a meritocracy, so the more good code you
  contribute, the more you will be allowed to contribute: that is, the 
  better a developer you prove yourself to be through your actions, the
  more responsibility you will be given.  This is not a <q>Consortium</q>.
  There is no such thing as membership.  If you contribute code, then you're
  a member.  It's as simple as that.
 <p>Now, in our role as integrators of the work being done by the countless
  others out on the net, we do have to have some rules.  If we just blindly
  accept any patch thrown at us, pretty soon we'll have total chaos, and a
  source tree that doesn't work, and that's no good for anybody.
 <h2>Module Owners</h2>
 <p>The basic model we intend to operate under is that each major module
  will have an owner designated by mozilla.org. That person will be someone
  who knows the code well; is actually involved in developing the code,
  works well in the open source environment, and who feels that they are up
  to the task of being the arbiter of what should go in to that module, and
  what shouldn't. This person will also be the primary coder, but this is not
  a requirement. The module owner accepts improvements and bug fixes from
  others on the net.
 <p>Changes to a module are made by that module's owner, and then sent to
  mozilla.org for inclusion in our source distributions. If the owner of a
  module is new to the job, then we're probably going to work pretty closely
  with them to make sure that we're actually helping each other out: that 
  they're giving us what we need to meet our desired level of quality, and
  that we're giving them the information and assistance they need.  There are
  no hard and fast rules here, but one thing that is definitely true is that
  <a href="owners.html">module owners</a> will come to be judged, both by us
  and by the public, based on what they've accomplished.
 <h2>Benevolent Dictator</h2>
 <p>In this way, it's a self-regulating system: if a module owner is viewed
  by the public as not doing a good job (perhaps their releases tend to be
  buggy, or non-portable; or perhaps they aren't responsive to bug fixes or
  suggestions) then what will happen is, someone out on the net will say to
  themselves (and to us), <q>hey, I can do a better job than that.</q> And
  we will say to them, <q>go right ahead.</q>  
 <p>If the usurper and the old module owner can't work out their differences,
  then by default, the final decision becomes that of us here at mozilla.org:
  we will be in a situation where there are two people asking us to take their
  version of some particular module, and we're going to pick the better one
  to include in our source releases.
 <p>Now, hopefully it will almost never come to that. In most cases, we won't
  have to make those kinds of hard decisions, because people will tend to
  work it out themselves, and cooperate, and accept help when it is offered.
  There exists years of evidence in the open-source software community that 
  such things tend to work themselves out without a big fuss.
 <p>But, we here at mozilla.org decide what we put in the source distributions
  that we make.  So that gives us final say on what goes into <em>our</em>
  distributions.
 <p>Of course, anyone anywhere in the world can make their own source
  distributions: we aren't unique in that respect.  And that's another way
  that the system is self-regulating: if the public believes that we are
  making bad decisions about what to include and what not to include, about
  whose work to use and whose not to, or anything of that nature, then the
  public will vote with their collective feet: they will get their source
  distributions from someone other than mozilla.org, and we will have
  become irrelevant.
 <p>This is the way nearly all successful open-source software projects work,
  and that's why we're emulating it. We call this the <q>Benevolent Dictator</q>
  model. <q>Dictator</q> because there is one person (or organization) who
  eventually gets final say in the case of disputes; and <q>Benevolent</q>
  because the dictator always tries to do the right thing. Because if the
  dictator stops doing the right thing, the dictator becomes ignored, and
  ceases to be a dictator at all.
 <p>For those more democratically-minded, another way of looking at it is
  that the final arbiter really is something of an elected official: the voting
  process consists of whether anyone listens to them.
