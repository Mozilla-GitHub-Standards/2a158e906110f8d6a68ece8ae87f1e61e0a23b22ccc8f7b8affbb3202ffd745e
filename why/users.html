<H2 class="sun">Overview</H2>
<p class="overview">Mozilla is a world-class open source browser that is designed
     from the ground up to support open internet standards across a variety of
     platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, OS/2, Solaris, and many more. 
     Mozilla provides users with acclaimed browsing convenience along with
     power features such as pop-up blocking and tabbed browsing. Mozilla also
     provides a sophisticated platform for developing web and intranet
     applications using cutting edge technologies such as XML, SOAP and XSLT.
     <!-- need to flesh this out more, are these the best examples? -->

<h2 class="moon">Benefits</h2>

<ul class="moz"> 
    <li class="reason"><!-- standards pundits -->
    Mozilla offers users very good support for Web standards
    and excellent compatibility with the existing Web. With Mozilla, pages lay
    out correctly and quickly. In addition, Mozilla supports popular plug-ins
    such as Java, Flash, Acrobat, Windows Media Player, QuickTime, and RealPlayer.
    (<a href="users-features.html#standards" title="Read more about Mozilla's
    support for the Web.">more...</a>) <!-- again, this needs better wording but
    I think it's important to put the "displays the existing web and works with
    modern plug-ins info right up top --></li>

    <li class="reason"><!-- newbies -->
    The Mozilla Suite has many features to make browsing
    and email easier, faster and more convenient. Once you've surfed the web
    using Mozilla's pop-up blocking and sidebar, or read your email in
    peace with Mozilla junk mail controls, you'll never be satisfied with 
    anything else. 
    (<a href="users-features.html#convenience" title="Read more about Mozilla's
    convenience and anti-annoyance features.">more...</a>)
    </li>

    <li class="reason"><!-- power users -->
    And for the power user, Mozilla provides sophisticated control over your
    browsing experience. With Mozilla's advanced JavaScript controls, tabbed
    browsing, image blocking, privacy management, themes
    and extensions, advanced users will find everything they need to optimize
    the Web experience. For customizing your entire internet experience, Mozilla
    can't be beat. (<a href="users-features.html#power" title="Read more about
    Mozilla's power-user features.">more...</a>) 
    </li>

    <li class="reason"><!-- web and application developers-->
    In addition to being a great browser and mail client, Mozilla is also a web
    development platform with advanced tools like the DOM Inspector, the
    JavaScript Debugger, and support for XML, DHTML, XUL, SOAP, XSLT and more.
    We hope you'll agree that there's no better platform for building web and intranet
    applications. (<a href="users-features.html#apps" title="Read more about
    Mozilla as a platform for development.">more...</a>)
