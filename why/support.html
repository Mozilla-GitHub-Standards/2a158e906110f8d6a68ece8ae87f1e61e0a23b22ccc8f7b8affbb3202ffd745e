<h1>Why Support Mozilla?</h1>

<p>A Mozilla-based browser is a web browser that is based on the Mozilla Open Source
movement, and makes use of the Gecko layout engine which is at the core of the
software. This article tells you why supporting this growing family of Gecko based
browsers is important.

<h2 id="why-intro">What Does Supporting Mozilla Mean?</h2>

<p>A feeling of dread is likely to overtake web developers when they hear about yet another
class of browsers that they have to support. More proprietary hacks to their code?  Yet more
code forks?  In short, it sounds like more worry. Why bother?
</p>

<p>The good news is you no longer have to rely on proprietary browser-specific
workarounds and hacks in Mozilla browsers. Save yourself that lugubrious overhead,
and do away with code forks! One of the key benefits of Mozilla is that it is the
most standards compliant browser there is. This means that instead of relying on
browser-specific mechanisms to get your content to display as you intend it to,
you can send content to your users using W3C standards. For most websites, this
would mean:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using standard markup: HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.x, or even XML for content structure</li>
  <li>Using stylesheets: CSS for presentation or even XSLT</li>
  <li>Interacting and manipulating a document in a standard way: W3C DOM APIs exposed
      via JavaScript for dynamic presentation</li>
</ul> 

<p>
All of these are W3C standards, and Mozilla has leading support for these and
other standards. Any browser that conforms to standards ought to display content written
according to the standards in a consistent way. This is in fact the goal of these
standards - to extricate developers from the morass of proprietary display mechanisms
that was the staple of the Web during the early days. The good news is that leading
browser vendors have got robust support for standards, including Safari 2.x, Internet Explorer 7,
Opera 9.x and browsers based on Mozilla. In essence, this is what supporting Mozilla
means: supporting the Web Standards that are now implemented in many browsing
applications, and minimizing code forks.
</p>

<p>The early days of the Web were rife with proprietary code forks that used nuanced
browser-specific heuristics to detect which browser the code was running on. Web
developers are likely to remember this particular code fork with a shudder:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
if (document.all)
{
    // This must be IE
    // Do things that work only on IE
    // Generate IE-specific markup
    // Use IE-specific DOM 
}
else if (document.layers)
{
    // This must be Netscape 4.x
    // Do things that work only on Netscape 4.x
    // Generate Netscape 4.x-specific markup
    // Use Netscape 4.x-specific DOM
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Mozilla's support for standards yields developers some concrete
benefits - important one is it decreases the maintenance nightmare
of supporting various different code forks for different browsers - 
developers can now support Web Standards, unlike the code fork
depicted above, since standards are becoming the norm in many browsers.
This is particularly true given the fact that Mozilla based browsers
work on many different platforms, and your pages can be rendered
the same way on many platforms.
</p>
        
<h2 id="cross-platform">Support Multiple Platforms by Supporting Mozilla</h2>

<p> Thinking about different platforms is the best way to
future-proof your site, and supporting Mozilla is the best place to start.
Mozilla based browsers can display web pages in exactly the same way on
Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X (or any other platform that they are built to
run on). In fact, being cross-platform in a consistent way with identical
behavior on all platforms is one of the core tenets of Mozilla's engineering
team. Here is a quick short list of some Mozilla based browsers and the
platforms your pages can be rendered on if you support Mozilla-based browsers:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/">Netscape 8</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/applications/aol/">AOL</a>
      for Mac OS X</li>
  <li><a href="http://free.compuserve.com/trycsfree/index.adp?262599">CompuServe</a>
      for Windows</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>, on Mac OS X</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a>, for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows</li>
  <li><a href="/projects/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>, for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows</li>
  <li>and <a href="/university/HOF.html">more...</a></li>
<li><a href="http://kmeleon.sourceforge.net/">K-Meleon 1.x</a>, a light, ultra-fast Mozilla-based browser on Windows platform</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/">Epiphany</a></li>
<li><a href="http://galeon.sourceforge.net/">Galeon 2.x</a>, a GNOME Web browser based on Gecko</li>
</ul>

<p>The Internet is moving in the direction of more platforms, not fewer
platforms - everyone acknowledges that there has been a veritable boom in
Internet-capable devices. Since Mozilla is open source, the number of platforms the
source code can be built on has not yet been seen. Supporting Mozilla by adherence
to standards ensures that future devices can be built that are aware of how
standards-based content is structured, and adjust accordingly. An example might
be applying style to transform a display to fit a hand held device, as in the
case of the PDAize feature of
<a href="http://glazman.org/weblog/">Daniel Glazman's Web Log.</a></p>


<h2 id="future">Mozilla Heralds the Future of the Web</h2>

<p> By supporting Mozilla based browsers, you will have your finger right on the racing
pulse of the latest tendencies in web development. Mozilla provides good and improving 
support for the standards that were mentioned before (XML, XHTML, CSS, DOM) but also
support for web services based on XML protocols such as SOAP. The ability to generate
dynamic client-server interactions without fresh page loads in a safe environment is a
real paradigm shift for web content. The next generation of web based transactions suggest
rapid data-driven connections without presentational overhead.  Mozilla provides this
today with a low-level SOAP API and suport for the XMLHttpRequest object for basic XML
exchanges. Improved support for SOAP is on the way! Also, builds of Mozilla contain
experimental support for inline SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) - in which graphics and
data are all in an XML document that you can manipulate via the DOM. Open source
development processes allow many engineers to build future capabilities into the browser,
and by supporting Mozilla, you'll always be abreast of what the latest capabilities are.</p>

<!--
<h2 id="safe">Mozilla Is Safe</h2>

<p> A web experience that you build for your users should not be unsafe, and your users'
data should never be compromised. Mozilla is not prone to the same kinds of security
vulnerabilities that <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/29621.html">other
browsers are prone to</a>, and any security issue gets a rapid turnaround. You can also
follow the progress of security bug fixing, since it is in the open just as other
information about Mozilla is in the open. Mozilla also provides support for the Platform
for Privacy Preferences, and thus, you can build a web experience that allows users to be
aware of your site's privacy policies.</p>
-->

<h2 id="integrated-debugging">Mozilla Offers Useful Cross Platform Tools</h2>

<p> One boon to web developers is the fact that the Mozilla standalone browser has an
integrated debugger -- an extremely helpful tool for you to use as you build a standards
compliant site. The Venkman JavaScript debugger allows you to run your site's
code through it and determine where errors lie, and it is completely cross platform.
It is launched right from the Tools menu (select Web Development) of the Mozilla standalone
browser, and works in the same way on Linux, Windows, and OS X. Another nifty tool is
the DOM Inspector, which allows you to inspect the DOM of <i>any</i> web document on any
platform. It is also available via the Tools menu under Web Development and is a part of
the Mozilla standalone distribution. These tools are helpful in supporting a wide
variety of browsers, and by supporting Mozilla, you gain the advantage of being able to
use these tools.</p>

<h2 id="open-source">Mozilla Has The Attention of the Open Source Community</h2>

<p> Imagine how much easier your life would be if you had an armada of developers
to help you with your questions. One benefit of supporting Mozilla is that it has
the attention of the enthusiastic and thriving 
<a href="/community/">open source community</a>. Several
hundred developers participate in Mozilla's open development process. The browser
bug database is open to all, and developers can log bugs and see their
resolution interactively. The news groups are a dynamic medium in which to exchange
information with other developers, and also a place to find skilled developers to
answer your questions. Sites such as <a href="http://www.mozdev.org">mozdev.org</a>
also provide useful toolbars and widgets that you can employ within your enterprise.
The best part about this is that this is usually a free sharing of experiences, tips,
and pointers, not a pay-per-incident technical support hotline. And by participating,
you can help others as well.</p>

<h2 id="customizability">Mozilla Is Highly Configurable</h2>
<p> Supporting a browser by sending it the right kind of content is one thing, but imagine
if you could distribute a browser to your end users that was completely customized to
your enterprise, especially including its look and feel? For example, imagine a major
football team distributing a themed browser showing the team's colors and mascot
to their fan base from their website. The look and feel of Mozilla is highly customizable,
or <i>skinnable</i>. The user interface itself is in XML (in a user interface language
called XUL - short of XML User Interface Language).

<!-- 
Netscape, for instance, distributes
the Client Customization Kit (CCK) for configuring the browser for various enterprise
settings. Instead of a big &quot;N&quot; logo for Netscape, you can replace it with a
logo of your choice. The browser is completely skinned to suit your enterprise. In fact,
you can dynamically skin Mozilla based browsers such as Netscape and Mozilla right
from your site by installing a skin via XPInstall. This ability to <i>personalize</i>
or customize someone's web surfing environment is yet another compelling reason to
support Mozilla based browsers.
