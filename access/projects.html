  <h1>Mozilla Accessibility Projects and Grants</h1>

  <p>Mozilla accessibility has come a long way since the release of
  Firefox 1.5. We now have support from the two largest screen
  readers (JAWS and Window-Eyes), as well as the industry's first
  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/access/dhtml">DHTML and AJAX
  accessibility support</a>. Our keyboard support is mostly complete,
  although there are a couple of important issues.</p>

  <p>So what remains to be done? The following is a list of
  standalone accessibility projects that can be attempted by a
  single person or group.</p>

  <p>In some cases, the Mozilla Foundation will provide small grants for work in these areas. Please contact aaronleventhal @ moonset.net for more information.</p>

  <p>Note: where possible, our project strategies should be in sync
  with our long term goals:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Support for standards</li>

    <li>Develop solutions in open source</li>
    <li>Section 508 compliance, which allows U.S. government
    procurement (see our <a href=
    "http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/vpat.html">VPAT compliance
    statement</a>, which has some open issues remaining) </li>

    <li>Involve the wider open source community in accessible
    software development (documenting, educating and evangelizing
    may be necessary)</li>

    <li>Get end user and industry uptake. It is often more
    beneficial to get our accessibility features adopted by the end
    user in existing products, rather than create new extensions or
    software modules.</li>

    <li>Support cross platform accessibility</li>

    <li>Develop the documentation, tools and infrastructure so that
    users with disabilities themselves are encouraged to get
    involved in the open source process</li>
  </ol>

        <td>Turn the Firefox "Broken Website Reporter" tool and
        evangelism teams into a force for web accessibility. In Firefox 3,
        Disability access will be added to the list of
        website issues. Hook up existing interested parties in web
        accessibility to the tool and online database at
        reporter.mozilla.org. Start the community moving in the
        direction of using these statistics to improve a11y on the
        web.</td>

        <td>Good project to help unify the industry which already
        spends a lot of resources in different ways to evangelize
        web accessibility. Requires a self-starter with

        applications.</td>

        <td>DHTML accessibility is a
        breakthrough technology that allows accessibility of web
        applications written with DHTML and/or AJAX. We're looking
        to get more industry adoption, but this is currently
        considered a technology with a lot of promise, with the
        ability to release the creativity of web developers for Web
        2.0, while maintaining or even increasing the level
        accessibility we've had with static HTML.</td>

        tools and make the process work for them.</td>

        <td>Unless the tools and process used by the open source
        community are accessible, then we will never really fix the

        <td>It's not clear whether current XUL authoring
        environments are on the track to adoption. If they are,
        then they certainly need to address a11y. We need to take a

        driving Sunbird or assistive technology developers.</td>

        <td>Calendar apps require a high degree of keyboard
        navigation tweaks and typically involve many custom widgets
        that are not accessible out of the box. The benefit is
        high. Currently users with disabilities are pushed to MS
        Outlook. An opportunity to get involved with a great
        project closer to the beginning, rather than tacking a11y
        on at the end. A VPAT for section 508 compliance should be
        published.</td>

        another engine for users with disabilities to help with
        common accessibility problems on popular web sites. Find or
        create a good location for these scripts so that as many
        users can benefit as possible.</td>

        <td>We can't expect end users to create actual GreaseMonkey
        scripts, so a UI layer on top which simplifies
        accessibility script writing would be useful. However, it
        should be possible to write the raw script as well. The
        more we can get people to share these the more useful they

        disabilities by removing unneeded cruft from web pages.
        Less content to read, navigate through or get confused by.
        Possible implementation strategies: create a Firefox
        plugin, extension or Grease Monkey script that compares
        pages on the same website (and possibly remembers the
        results). May need to be able to crawl a page looking for
        links to similar content. See <a href=

        possible/sensible. Work with any groups and Universities
        with the same goal (such as UIUC).</td>

        today. This may involve creativity in terms of developing
        simple yet powerful filtering options to enable following
