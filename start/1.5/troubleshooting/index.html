<p>Be sure to read the <b><a href="/releases/mozilla1.5/">Mozilla 1.5
Release Notes</a></b> for common known problems on your operating
system.</p>

<dl class="qandaset">
<dt id="layout">1.
Why doesn&#8217;t my page look right in Mozilla?
<dd class="answer">
<p>Mozilla is designed to support Internet standards as thoroughly
as possible. Some sites have pages coded around standard quirks of
older browsers (rather than standards-compliant code that all
current browsers, e.g. Mozilla, Netscape 7, and Microsoft
Internet Explorer 5.5 or later, can read), and some sites even use <a
href="http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2002/browser-detection/">
erroneous browser sniffing</a> to block Mozilla. If this is the
case, you should contact the site webmaster about updating their
server configuration and page code.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="garbage">2.
I&#8217;m trying to view a file on a website, and the address
looks correct, but all I see is a bunch of garbled garbage on my
screen.
<dd class="answer">
<p>You can usually work around this by right-clicking the link,
going to &#8216;Save Link Target As&#8217;, saving the file to
disk and then viewing the saved file locally.</p>

<p>The typical cause is that the web server is serving the
file as a plain-text file. Contact the site administrator
about the misconfiguration.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="bank">3.
My bank site blocks Mozilla!
<dd class="answer">
<p>Some financial-institute sites block access from Mozilla
because the site administrators do not understand the
security features in Mozilla. Mozilla is secure and does
not save sensitive information such as password if the
site choose to prevent it. Talk to your bank about
removing the block on Mozilla.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="lock">4.
I cannot open Mozilla / my profile. Mozilla says the profile is in use.
<dd class="answer">
<p>Look in your <a href="../faq/profile.html#location">profile directory</a>
for file called <code class="filename">parent.lock</code>,
<code class="filename">lock</code>, or
<code class="filename">.parentlock</code>. Delete the file.

<!--
parent.lock win/mac
.parentlock Unix
--> 

(The file is created on start-up to prevent multiple instances of
Mozilla or Mozilla-based browser from accessing the same profile
simultaneously. The file is destroyed on exit.)
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="https">5.
Why can&#8217;t I access secure (<code>https://</code>) websites? (Linux)
<dd class="answer">
<p>The most likely cause is that you did not install the Personal Security Manager
when you installed Mozilla. Uninstall Mozilla and reinstall with it included.
You can also <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/releases/mozilla1.5/linux-xpi/psm.xpi">
install it directly</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="junkbuster">6.
I&#8217;m using a transparent proxy (such as Junkbuster) and I&#8217;m
having weird browsing problems. What&#8217;s happening?
<dd class="answer">
<p>Some transparent proxies (including some versions of
Junkbuster) do not handle HTTP/1.1 properly. The first thing to try
is to go to Edit | Preferences | Advanced | HTTP Networking and
select &#8216;Use HTTP 1.0&#8217;.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="middle-click">7.
Middle click (or Ctrl+click) on a link does not open a new tab.
<dd class="answer">
<p>
The option for opening links in new tabs with middle-click (or Ctrl+click)
is off by default. To turn it on, open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.
Navigate to Navigator | Tabbed Browsing catagory in the left pane. Then
check <q>Middle-click, Control+click or Control+Enter on links in a
Web page</q>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="theme">8.
I love a theme I&#8217;m using, but weird things are happening
with it. Is there a way to fix it?
<dd class="answer">
<p>Some third-party themes lack a file called
<code class="filename">fakeAccount.css</code>. The absence of this file can cause buggy
behavior, such as windows failing to minimize properly. Check if a
more recent version of the theme is available.</p>

<p>If you feel comfortable with experimenting with theme files, create an empty
file called <code class="filename">fakeAccount.css</code> and put it into the JAR of the
affected theme. JARs are standard zip files, so you can open
and rewrite them using the zip utility of your choice. Be sure to
keep a copy of the original JAR file on hand in case of problems.</p>

<p>If this does not fix the problem, and the problem does not occur
after uninstalling the theme and using Classic or Modern, you may wish
to report the problem to the theme&#8217;s author.</p>

<dt id="brokeninstall">9.
I tried to install a Mozilla add-on XPI directly
from a web page, but clicking the &#8216;Install&#8217; link didn&#8217;t work.
<dd class="answer">
<p>You need to switch on both JavaScript (in Edit | Preferences |
Advanced | Scripts &amp; Windows) and Software Installation (in
Edit | Preferences | Advanced | Software Installation) for this to
work.</p>

<p>If it still doesn&#8217;t work, try downloading the XPI and
installing it directly.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="install">10.
I have downloaded a Mozilla add-on (.xpi) file, but
can&#8217;t figure out how to install it.
<dd class="answer">
<p>Check that Software Installation is enabled, then open the file
in Mozilla by dragging it to the browser window; by opening it
using File | Open File; by typing the location into the location
bar; or (in Windows) by double-clicking on the XPI file and telling
Windows to open <code class="filename">.xpi</code> files using Mozilla.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="uninstall">11.
How do I uninstall something installed from an XPI?
<dd class="answer">
<p>There is not yet a method of automatically uninstalling XPIs
other than themes. However, when you have uninstalled Mozilla prior
to installing a new build, you can manually remove the unwanted
XPI.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="sidebar">12.
The sidebar comes up empty.
<dd class="answer">
<p>Try closing and opening the sidebar again, with the F9 key. If this
fails, try <a href="#personaltoolbar">resetting the interface</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="email">13.
Help! I can&#8217;t access my e-mail any more!
<dd class="answer">
<p>The two common causes of e-mail problems in Mozilla Mail
are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The mail summary files (files with the <code class="filename">.msf</code> extension)
have become corrupted.</p></li>

<li><p>Some test builds of Mozilla have been known to improperly
compact mail folders, rendering the mail within unreadable by
Mozilla Mail/News.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the first case: exit Mozilla (including Quick Launch), find
the folders in your <a href="../faq/profile.html#location">user profile</a>
that contain your e-mail (the <code class="filename">Mail</code> and, if you use IMAP,
<code class="filename">ImapMail</code> folders). Back up your mail folders, and delete the
<code class="filename">.msf</code> files. Do <strong>not</strong> delete files that appear
without any extension &#8211; these are the files that contain your
actual e-mail. Restarting Mozilla Mail should automatically generate
new summary files.</p>

<p>In the second case: the mail files are stored as plain text, so
you can try opening the mail files with a text editor (or word
processor) to recover the text of your e-mail by hand.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="nautils">14.
I use GNOME. I installed Mozilla from a mozilla.org binary, and
now Nautilus isn&#8217;t working properly.
<dd class="answer">
<p>If Nautilus has been configured to use the Mozilla Gecko
rendering engine, installing a mozilla.org binary on top of that may cause
odd problems and conflicts. You should use the package of Mozilla supplied
by your Unix or GNU/Linux distribution, as their version <em>should</em> work
properly with their package of GNOME.</p>

<p>If you want to install a 
<a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/nightly">testing 
build</a> of Mozilla, install it to a non-default location (e.g., in your 
home directory), and leave the system defaults to use the older distribution 
version.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="virus">15.
My anti-virus program thinks my INBOX has a virus and won&#8217;t let me
access my INBOX!
<dd class="answer">
<p>This happens when the anti-virus program is set to check
<i>all</i> files (not just those that can actually carry malicious
code), and to lock or quarantine any file containing anything it
thinks is a virus signature.</p>

<p>Switch off your anti-virus, open
your inbox (deleting any e-mail with attachments that may contain a
virus), set the anti-virus to scan only file types that can actually
carry malicious code, take the anti-virus out of &#8216;paranoid&#8217;
mode if it is set to that, and switch it back on.</p>

<p>Mozilla Mail is not susceptible to known e-mail viruses.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="menubar">16.
My toolbar/menubar is gone! How do I get it back?
<dd class="answer">
<p>If you cannot get your toolbar back from the View | Show/Hide menu,
look under the menubar/toolbar area. You should find a small rectangular
box. Click the button to show your toolbar. </p>
</dd>

<dt id="personaltoolbar">17.
My personal toolbar is empty, and I cannot add any bookmarks to it. How do I fix it?

<dd class="answer">
<p>Open the Bookmark Manager (open the Bookmarks menu and choose Manage Bookmarks).
In the window,  select Personal Toolbar Folder. Open the View menu and choose Set as
Personal Toolbar Folder.</p>

<p>If that does not work, you need to <strong>reset the interface</strong>.
Completely exit Mozilla, then delete the file <code class="filename">localstore.rdf</code> in your
<a href="../faq/profile.html#location">profile</a>.
<span class="note">You will lose some UI settings such as toolbar button and Sidebar
visibilities, but those can be easily reset.</span></p>
</dd>

<dt id="download">18.
I cannot download large files.

<dd class="answer">
  <p>When you download a file in Mozilla, the file is first saved to your
  temporary directory and then moved to the destination directory. If you have
  restricted space for your temporary directory, consider either increase the
  space or use a download manager for large downloads.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="download.rdf">19.
File downloading has been very slow lately, why?

<dd class="answer">
  <p>When you have a large list of download history, Mozilla becomes
  slow in starting and finishing file downloads. To clean the list, open
  the Tools menu and choose Download Manager. Select the entries you want
  to delete (hold down the Shift key for continuous selection, and the
  Ctrl key for non-continuous selection). Then click Remove from List.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="restore-mail">20.
    My system crashed when I exited Mozilla. Now all my mail are gone. What do I do?

<dd class="answer">
   <p>Your preference file is corrupted and has been reset to default. If you have
   a <a href="../faq/profile.html#backup">backup</a> copy of your profile folder,
   the easiest way is restoring the <code class="filename">prefs.js</code> file.</p>

   <p>If you do not have your profile backed up, follow these steps:</p>

   <ol>
   <li>
     <p>First, make a copy of your <a href="../faq/profile.html#location">profile</a>
     at another location.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
     <p>Now, navigate to the <code class="filename">Mail</code> sub-directory of your
     <a href="../faq/profile.html#location">profile</a> directory.
     You may want to change the view setting to see all of the
     sub-directory names.</p>

     <p><img src="mail-folder-1.png" width="305" height="311" class="screenshot"></p>
   </li>
   <li>
     <p>Open Mozilla Mail &amp; Newsgroup. Open the File menu, choose
     Offline, then choose Work Offline from the submenu.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
     <p>Recreate your mail accounts.</p>

     <p>For POP3 accounts (mail is downloaded to your computer):
     when you are prompted to enter the incoming server, enter the
     name exactly as appeared in your Mail directory. At the end
     of the account setup, if you see the checkbox to download messages,
     make sure you un-check the box.</p>

     <p>For IMAP accounts (mail is stored on servers):
     No special step is needed.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
     <p>Revist your Mail directory. You should see duplicate folders
     for your POP3 accounts if you have those.</p>

     <p><img src="mail-folder-2.png" width="305" height="311" class="screenshot"></p>
   </li>

   <li>
     <p>If you want to restore your previous newsgroup accounts,
     go to the <code class="filename">News</code> directory of you profile.</p>

     <p>In Mail &amp; Newsgroup, recreate your newsgroup accounts.
     When you are prompted to enter the newsgroup server, enter the
     name exactly as appeared in your News directory.</p>

     <p>Revist your News directory. You should see duplicate folders
     and files for your newsgroup accounts.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
     <p>Completely exit Mozilla.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
     <p>Open the <code class="filename">prefs.js</code> file in your profile in a text editor.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
     <p>Find the lines with your new account directory name, e.g.</p>
<pre class="example">
user_pref(&quot;mail.server.server2.directory&quot;, &quot;C:\\...\\Mail\\<strong>Local Folders-1</strong>&quot;);
user_pref(&quot;mail.server.server3.directory&quot;, &quot;C:\\...\\Mail\\<strong>pop.isp-1.com</strong>&quot;);
user_pref(&quot;mail.server.server4.directory&quot;, &quot;C:\\...\\News\\<strong>news.isp-1.com</strong>&quot;);
</pre>

<!--
user_pref(&quot;mail.server.server2.directory-rel&quot;, &quot;[ProfD]Mail/Local Folders-1");
user_pref(&quot;mail.server.server3.directory-rel&quot;, &quot;[ProfD]Mail/pop.isp-1.com");
-->
     <p>Change that last portion of the line to your original account directory names, e.g.</p>
<pre class="example">
user_pref(&quot;mail.server.server2.directory&quot;, &quot;C:\\...\\Mail\\<strong>Local Folders</strong>&quot;);
user_pref(&quot;mail.server.server3.directory&quot;, &quot;C:\\...\\Mail\\<strong>pop.isp.com</strong>&quot;);
user_pref(&quot;mail.server.server4.directory&quot;, &quot;C:\\...\\News\\<strong>news.isp.com</strong>&quot;);
</pre>
   </li>

   <li>
     <p>Save the file. You should have all your mail and news data restored when you
     restart Mozilla.</p>
   </li>
</ol>

<p>To prevent this from happening, we advise you to
<a href="../faq/profile.html#backup">back up</a> your profile periodically.</p>

</dd>

<dt id="bookmarks-gone">21.
    Help, my bookmarks are all gone!

<dd class="answer">
<p>In the very unfortunate event that your bookmarks are lost, you will not be
able to restore them unless you have backup. You may try to reclaim some of
them from your browsing history; open the History window (go menu,
history), right click (option click on Mac OS) on the Web address
you want to bookmark, and choose Bookmark this Link.</p>

<p>To prevent this from happening, we advise you to
<a href="../faq/profile.html#backup">back up</a> your profile periodically.</p>
