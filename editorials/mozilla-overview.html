<h1>The Mozilla Project and mozilla.org</h1>
<p>I'm often asked questions about how the Mozilla project operates. Since
there are probably many people with similar questions, I've created an
overview of mozilla.org and the Mozilla project. In this discussion, I
use "Mozilla" to mean the codebase itself, "Mozilla project" to mean the
set of activities around the Mozilla code (development, testing, etc.)
and "Mozilla community" to mean the set of contributors engaged in these
activities.

<h2>mozilla.org</h2>
<p>The Mozilla Organization is the entity which coordinates Mozilla development.
The mission of mozilla.org is to foster a successful open-source project.
This means our core functions are to guide the overall development of the
Mozilla code itself, and to be the central meeting point of the Mozilla
development community. Participation in the Mozilla project is entirely
voluntary, and mozilla.org strives to make participation both useful and
desirable for potential contributors.
<p>mozilla.org provides a wide range of services to assist the Mozilla
development community. We provide technical and architectural direction
for the Mozilla project, working with contributors to make the Mozilla
code useful in a wide variety of products, platforms and devices. We manage
our source code repository with the same goals in mind. We develop and
implement processes to enhance public discussion, distributed development,
and peer review. We maintain the mozilla.org website and provide Mozilla-related
ftp services, newsgroups and mailing lists. mozilla.org also develops and
maintains a range of tools for use in the project. A good example is Bugzilla,
an open source bug tracking and management system developed by mozilla.org
and used by a diverse set of development projects.
<p>To promote distributed decision making by the development community,
mozilla.org delegates decision making authority for particular sections
of code (known as "modules") to individuals who are close to that code.
These individuals are known as "module owners." Each module owner
is authorized to make design and implementation decisions about that module,
to approve code for inclusion in the mozilla.org source code repository,
and to grant to others the right to add code to this repository. In this
system, mozilla.org staff members do not review each change to the source
tree before it is checked in. Doing so would be an enormous administrative
drag on the project.
<p>Instead, mozilla.org reserves to itself final decision making authority.
This includes the right to designate and remove module owners, to resolve
conflicts among contributors and to determine the direction of the project,
the code included in the repository, and the process by which the project
is run. mozilla.org exercises such rights only when necessary. This allows
the project to proceed quickly while maintaining mozilla.org's ultimate
ownership.
<p>In making decisions, mozilla.org uses the following guidelines:
<ul>
 <li>Decisions ought be proposed and discussed in public forums, and the resolution
  communicated in those forums.
 <li>Consensus should be sought, but unanimity is not required; few important
  decisions will be unanimous.
 <li>Alternatives that avoid head-on confrontation between contributors ought
  to be explored very carefully and adopted where appropriate.
 <li>Goals limited to a particular contributor should be implemented in that
  particular contributor's world.
 <li>Decisions must be based on what we believe is best for the entire community,
  not based on the desires of any one contributor.
</ul>

<h2>Mozilla Public License</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html">Mozilla Public
License</a> (the "MPL") sets out the terms under which the Mozilla code
may be used. The MPL has been approved by the Open Source Initiative as
an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">Open Source</a> license.
The MPL provides access to the Mozilla code on equal terms to all. The
MPL requires "Modifications" to MPL code, including new APIs, to be made
available in source code form. It then allows combination of MPL code with
other code governed by different, non-open source terms. For example, anyone
is free to create a commercial product by using Mozilla code, adding an
API, making that API available under the terms of the MPL, and then using
that API to call a proprietary library. In such a case, the MPL will not
affect the proprietary library, which may retain its own, different license.

<h2>mozilla.org <a href="../about/stafflist">Staff</a></h2>
<p>mozilla.org staff is composed of members of the Mozilla community who
have a more formalized involvement with mozilla.org.
<p>Staff members focus on the Mozilla project as a whole, not on any particular
Mozilla-based product. Some members of the mozilla.org staff are focused
primarily on the code itself, in the development, review and quality
arenas. Others focus on the tools mozilla.org uses. All of us focus on
community building: learning what the Mozilla community needs and trying
to provide it. Some staff members are paid to work full time on the
Mozilla project, others are paid to work part time on it, and some are
unpaid volunteers. We represent different perspectives, but we share a
common focus on the success of the Mozilla project.
<p>The bulk of the coding is not done by mozilla.org staff members; the
project would progress very slowly if this were the case. We do some hacking
in areas where staff members have particular expertise, or where problems
need solving. But the Mozilla development community does the bulk
of the development.

<h2>Mozilla Community</h2>
<p>The Mozilla community includes all those who contribute to Mozilla,
doing any of the multitude of things that help make Mozilla useful and
successful. These actions ultimately determine the direction of the
Mozilla project, through the contributions made and through participation
in the Mozilla forums where the day-to-day activity takes place.
Some people participate as individual volunteers, some through their educational
institution, and others work at commercial organizations.
<p>Mozilla is already an extraordinarily active open source project.
Excluding for the moment engineers employed by Netscape, the Mozilla community
includes contributors who participate in a wide range of activities.
Some play the quintessential role of developing and contributing new features
and fixing bugs in the code. Examples include MathML, the IRC client "Chatzilla",
the XML parser, the Active X component, Linux plug-in support, plain-text
processing, Java integration, bi-directional language support, and XML-RPC.
Other contributors test the product, finding and documenting bugs, and
creating test cases and other tools to assist developers. For example,
Mozilla monthly stability releases are downloaded approximately 100,000
times from mozilla.org's Mountain View servers alone. Over four thousand
people have taken the time and energy to report bugs. Approximately
700 people (of whom slightly less than one-third have been from Netscape)
have identified and filed more than 5 bugs each.
<p>Contributors create ports of Mozilla to additional platforms. Others
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html#mlp">
localize</a>
Mozilla for particular languages and cultures (follow the link to see the 
list of the 46 languages into which Mozilla is currently being localized).
Some help implement standards. Others help with communication, maintaining
the mozilla.org website, writing documentation, and educating new members
of the community. Communication occurs through the mozilla.org website,
the developer newsgroups, our bugtracking database "Bugzilla," and the
Internet Relay Chat ("IRC") channel #mozilla on irc.mozilla.org.
And of course, the ever-ingenious Chris Nelson has created <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/">MozillaZine</a>,
an independent source of Mozilla news.
<p>Occasionally the multiple roles played by a contributor cause confusion.
For example, Netscape is a major contributor to the Mozilla code. At the
same time, Netscape uses the Mozilla code as the basis of its Netscape
6 product. This has caused some people to mistakenly believe that the Mozilla
code and Netscape 6 are the same thing. This is not correct. Anyone is
free to use Mozilla code to create a product, and to combine Mozilla code
with other code to create that product. Netscape does this, starting with
Mozilla code, adding a set of Netscape specific items and additional code,
and creating Netscape 6. Anyone is also free to use a subset of the
Mozilla code in a product. Many companies do this, using the Gecko layout
engine, for example.
<p>The Mozilla project is attracting dedicated, diligent and phenomenally
talented people, both as individual volunteer participants and as employees
of commercial vendors like Netscape. Mozilla is a vibrant project
today with enormous potential for the future. Come join us.
