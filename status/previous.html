Image Lib, while used in NGLayout branch,  does not

I'm betting many functions can be radically simplified.

				<LI>
We spent this week doing lots of multi-platform testing and bug-fixing,
particularly platform-specific bugs and build problems on unix platforms
such as AIX, HP/UX, and OSF1.&nbsp; In order to fix inadequacies in some
vendor-supplied math libraries (with are the basis for the JavaScript Math
object), <A HREF="mailto:mikeang@netscape.com">Mike Ang</A> added fdlibm, a library
which either wraps the vendor-supplied functions or re-implements them
correctly.<BR>
					<BR>
				</LI>
				<LI>
<A HREF="mailto:fur@netscape.com">Scott Furman</A> altered the build so that certain
platform-specific parameters (stored in the jscpucfg.h file) are automatically
generated rather than relying on developers to manually make changes to
this file for every platform.&nbsp; Hopefully, this will cut down on the
platform-specific patches to JavaScript.</LI>

simplified include path mechanism.  No longer do we see
dozens of -I$(XPDIST)/public/blahblah flags in each compile

The first rebuild needs to be from the top, so all the headers
get exported into dist/include, but other than that there

			<P>From Nisheeth Ranjan, we get this update:
			<P><B>Layout:</B>
			<UL>
				<LI>Mike Shaver and Eric Pollmann are working on Perignon. 
This is a project that tries to store CSS style information
on a tree rather than in a style database consisting of hash
tables keyed on tags, classes, and ids.  They have already
gotten CSS inheritance to work much better with this
approach.  Read about it at
<A HREF="../classic/layout-classic/perignon.html">http://www.mozilla.org/layout/perignon.html</A>.</LI>
				<P>
				<LI>Layout Probe API.  We are pretty close to completing an
API that will let an external  DLL query layout for
information about the different layout elements displayed on
screen.  The second code drop from Ori Kravitz was checked
in today.  All that remains is to do traversal of layers and
implement a function on each FE that listens for an external
process's request for loading the test DLL.
</LI>
				<P>
				<LI>Layer/Ilayer reflow got checked into mozilla this week. 
This should fix layout on sites like slashdot.org and
altavista which display banner ads inside ilayers.</LI>
				<P>
				<LI>Mariner bug fixing is going on as usual.  The scrollbar
no longer jumps up and down as you resize the window. 
Adjacent left aligned tables do not swap places on resizes.</LI>
				<P>
				<LI>An experimental change went into Mozilla this week where
we enable the compositor at the end of layout rather than at
the beginning.  This essentially keeps the earlier page on
the display until enough of the next page is available for
display, and then, boom, the new page displays.  Blank page
time is reduced a lot.

We need to discuss with all the mozillians out there which
of the following two options they like better:
</LI>
				<UL>
									
					<LI>a) clicking a link and seeing a blank page for 10 seconds
before the new page displays.</LI>
					<LI>b) clicking a link and seeing the new page's layout progress
on the status bar for 10 seconds before the new page
displays.	
			</LI>
				</UL>
				<P>If anybody reading this status report has feedback on this
issue please post to the mozilla.general newsgroup.		
			</P>
			</UL>
			<P><B>Mariner (page reflow) To Do List:</B>
			<UL>
				<LI>Apply CSS style rules during reflow.</LI>
				<P>
				<LI>Implement timeout based reflow so that resizes on large
pages return to the event loop and don't hang the UI.

			<P>&quot;The initial CVS import of Berkeley DB 2.4.14.1 from Sleepycat was done
Wednesday evening.  The repository directory is mozilla/db; though no
module pulls it yet, it's there.  It's been imported on the vendor
branch; vendor tag SLEEPYCAT, release tag DB_2_4_14_1.  Technically
Sleepycat is module owner, but since they're still getting their CVS
access going, I did the import for them.</P>
			<P>The next step will be integrating it with the build.  I'd like to set it
up so that one can either use an already-compiled version, or (if this
is wanted) pull and build it as part of the mozilla build.</P>
			<P>After that, the mozilla-specific code (hooking in NSPR underneath, doing
the initialisation, etc.) will be added elsewhere, probably
mozilla/modules/db.  I'll probably end up module owner of that for now.&quot;</P>

			<H3>
Open JVM Integration (OJI)</H3>
			General OJI Development
			<UL>
				<LI>
Working toward an API freeze for the basic XPCOM plugin functionality.
We actually established a deadline to complete the final changes in this
area by today (10/9), but a lot of work has fallen on my plate and we probably
need to push it out another week. [warren -- his fault] Remaining API changes
in store are:</LI>
				<P>

				<UL>
					<LI>
Converting over to more NGLayout-like networking APIs (addition of an nsIPluginStreamListener
and nsIPluginInputStream).</LI>
					<P>

					<LI>
Converting over to the use of nsIServiceManager to manage access to other
browser services. This gives us a means to asynchronously notify of service
shutdown, facilitating the dynamic unloading of modules.</LI>
					<P>

					<LI>
Additional APIs for accessing cookies, preferences, etc.</LI>
					<P>
				</UL>
				<LI>
Schedule. The latest OJI schedule shows up finishing up around the beginning
of November (modulo my slippage). [warren]</LI>
				<P>
				<LI>
Testing. We came up with a long list things that should be tested for OJI
-- both Plugin API compliance and JVM compliance. I'll add a link to it
later. [warren]</LI>
				<P>
				<LI>
Java plugins in NGLayout! Michael has done a substantial portion of the
work necessary to make new XPCOM based plugins and JVM plugins work in
the NGLayout engine. The LiveConnect code isn't hooked up yet, but it's
underway. [michaelp]</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>
LiveConnect (Java/JavaScript integration)
			<UL>
				<LI>
Massive progress has been made in the area of LiveConnect integration.
All the basic Java/JavaScript interoperability is in place and we're now
focused on security issues, allowing privileges to be enabled in JavaScript
before calling Java and vice versa. [sudu]</LI>
				<P>
				<LI>
Because JNI assumes that "since you're native code, you can do anything"
we had to build a SecureJNI mechanism that would allow JavaScript privileges
to be propagated into Java. This has panned out to become a JNIEnv proxy
object that lives in the browser that talks to an nsISecureJNI object that
lives in the JVM plugin. Moreover, this architecture gave us the perfect
means to deal with the "same process, different threading worlds" problem
that has been lurking in the background for ages. Patrick and Sudu along
with Stanley and Ben from JavaSoft co-designed this and got it going. [beard,
sudu]</LI>
				<P>
				<LI>
In conjunction with the nsISecureJNI interface, we had to implement an
nsISecurityContext interface that would manage the privileges that propagate
between JavaScript and Java. This is mostly implemented, but not yet exported
to the JVM plugins. [sudu]</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>
Java Security Architecture
			<UL>
				<LI>
There are two main aspects of security we're dealing with:</LI>
				<P>
				<UL>
					<LI>
Privilege enablement. This is the integration of JavaScript privileges
with the Java 1.2 security architecture, described above. [sudu]</LI>
					<P>
					<LI>
Certificate verification. This allows Java VMs to verify signed JAR files
by calling on certificate verification facilities built into the browser.
The trick is to do this without invalidating our FIPS 140-1 compliance.
Raman has been working with Tom Weinstein to allow Jan at JavaSoft to build
a security provider that will do this. [raman]</LI>
				</UL>
			</UL>
			<P>
Apple MRJ JVM Plugin Development
			<UL>
				<LI>
The MRJ plugin is coming along nicely and has been delivered to Apple (in
conjunction with a corresponding Mozilla browser) for testing. Initially
there were several problems on both sides -- Mozilla hitting some assertions
due to reference counting problems, and MRJ's AWT having several problems.
These are in the process of being ironed out. [beard]</LI>
				<P>
				<LI>
Apple is planning a beta of MRJ 2.1 in 2 weeks and would really like to
demonstrate the OJI plugin at the same time. [beard]</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>
Microsoft JVM Plugin Development
			<UL>
				<LI>
The Microsoft JVM plugin that we worked on earlier this year is still completely
on hold. We would love to be able to provide it with Mozilla as an alternative
JVM on Windows platform for several reasons:</LI>
				<P>
				<UL>
					<LI>
it's already installed on most Windows machines, so download size is kept
to a minimum,</LI>
					<P>
					<LI>
it's fast, and</LI>
					<P>
					<LI>
it's what some people want to use.</LI>
					<P>
				</UL>
				Unfortunately, we have no one to work on it right now, and the code has
bit-rotted somewhat as the main OJI development has evolved. Contact me
if you want to be a hero and become the owner of a really cool contribution
to mozilla.org. [warren]

			<P>Last week I wrote about the numerous changes that we were making to the
directory structure of the JavaScript interpreter source.  We had planned
to "land" these changes on the trunk this week.  Our testing indicated
that we were not quite stable enough to drop the latest JavaScript engine
into mozilla yet.  (Our goal is absolutely no regressions!)  Look for
these changes to appear early in the week of October 12th.</P>

			<P>Sarah writes, &quot;Chris Yeh deleted a bunch more NSPR20 ifdefs getting closer and closer to
having it be unnecessary to have it defined. He did successfully delete
the LIBMOCHA ifdefs, so defining that is no longer necessary. (these have
both been defined on for at least a year, the were never going to be
turn-off-able, so no need to keep them around.)</P>
			<P>We had some excitement in gromit land with a NSPR3.0/security
incompatibility, but that doesn't appear to have affected mozilla. NSPR30
has been in Mozilla for almost 2 weeks now with no ill effect to Mozilla.&quot;</P>
			<P>Chris writes, &quot;
Removed old MOCHA #ifdefs from the Mozilla tree. For a sense of history,
the MOCHA #ifdefs were placed into the client back when Brendan Eich was
developing JavaScript over two years ago.</P>
			<P>Since the odds of going back to a JavaScript-less browser were somewhere
near zero, I took the liberty of cleaning out old unused code.</P>
			<P>The same thing is occurring with the NSPR20 and NSPR #ifdefs. I'm in the
process of removing all of these from the mozilla tree. They should all be
gone in a week or so.</P>
			<P>The reason why I'm doing this is to give me something to do in my spare
time, and make the build configuration a little easier.&quot;</P>

			<P> Gagan Saksena writes in with the NetLib update:
			<P>&quot;I have been working off late on a new cache (NuCache) architecture 
				that I plan on enabling for the rest of the developers on mozilla next 
				week. This new architecture is modular and allows for dynamic addition 
				of "cache modules" or mini-caches. I will also be publishing out a document 
				that describes in detail the architecture, the changes and the API for 
				using the new cache. There will also be a mini-FAQ on the NuCache. How 
				will it affect users? Well, they should see better performance, there 
				are changes which should make the general performance go up. For example, 
				the older architecture cleaned the cache to make space for a new object 
				when the user would click on a link. In the new architecture, the cache 
				gets cleaned in a background thread and hence the user doesn't see maintenance 
				work on the primary thread. There are other miscellaneous improvements 
				too.&quot;</P>

			<P>A huge JavaScript update from Scott Furman!</P>
			<P>We're making some significant changes in the organization of the directories 
				containing the JavaScript engine and the JavaScript code itself. If you're 
				not actually working on the JS engine code, you don't need to do anything 
				new - just download and build mozilla as usual. Let me say that again, 
				a little louder: YOU CAN IGNORE THIS MESSAGE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WORK ON 
				DEVELOPING THE JAVASCRIPT INTERPRETER CODE.</P>
			<P>Here's a summary of the changes we're making:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>The two main JavaScript development directories have been merged into 
					one directory.</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI>The single-threaded JavaScript engine is now completely decoupled 
					from the Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) code.</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI>Primary JavaScript development has moved onto a CVS branch.</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>We expect to "land" the merged source around October 6th, so you should 
				be prepared to pull new source then.</P>
			<P><B>Merging of js/ref and js/src</B></P>
			<P>For historical reasons, there were two variants of the JavaScript engine 
				code, one in the mozilla/js/ref directory and the other in mozilla/js/src. 
				The code in ref was only used to build the standalone JavaScript engine, 
				aka "JSRef". The code in src, which was automatically generated from ref, 
				was used to build the JS engine in the browser. (Internally, we also use 
				this engine in Netscape server products.) The differences between the 
				ref and src engines were limited to simple changes in the naming of types, 
				functions and header files. (For the curious, the reason that we ended 
				up with two JS directories is that the older ref directory was designed 
				to build with an earlier version of NSPR, whereas the newer src directory 
				was designed to link with NSPR2.)</P>
			<P>It had become something of a chore to keep the ref and src directories 
				in sync. There was always someone checking into one directory but not 
				the other. So, we decided to make it possible to build both the standalone 
				JS engine and the browser JS engine from the identical sources. The resulting 
				code now lives in the mozilla/js/src directory. (The mozilla/js/ref directory 
				is no longer needed and will be removed shortly.)</P>
			<P><B>NSPR dependency removed</B></P>
			<P>At the same time that we performed the transformation to merge the JavaScript 
				ref and src directories, we eliminated most of the dependencies that the 
				JS engine had on NSPR. This decision complicated the merge somewhat, but 
				the change allowed us to build a minimal standalone JS engine without 
				sucking in numerous unnecessary libraries and it will also help to shield 
				us from future incompatible NSPR changes. The less fortunate result of 
				this decision is that numerous types, macros and function names had to 
				be changed to avoid colliding with their NSPR counterparts, i.e. to handle 
				the case when NSPR header files and JS header files are mixed. This resulted 
				in large deltas to the source code.</P>
			<P>The only remaining dependencies that JS has on NSPR are for threading-related 
				primitives, e.g. PR_Lock(), PR_Unlock(), etc. The single-threaded JS engine 
				has no dependency on NSPR at all.</P>
			<P><B>Primary development of JavaScript engine moves to a branch</B></P>
			<P>Try as we might to avoid it, those of us working on the JavaScript engine 
				sometimes break the mozilla build or introduce insidious regressions in 
				JavaScript behavior. We're at the beginning stages of an ambitious plan 
				to insulate most mozilla developers from the bleeding-edge JavaScript 
				engine changes, but still allow them to be exposed to relatively fresh 
				code.</P>
			<P>The basic idea is to isolate primary development on a CVS branch and 
				then periodically "drop" the branch onto the trunk. (See this FAQ if you're 
				not familiar with CVS branches.) The drops will only be done after we 
				develop some degree of confidence in the code, i.e. by doing test builds 
				and by running automated tests on the standalone JS engine.. Initially, 
				we hope to perform drops at least once a week, so the code in the browser 
				will never be more than a week behind the code that's being developed. 
				Our first drop will probably take place around October 6th.</P>
			<P>If you aren't going to be working on JavaScript engine development, you 
				don't need to change anything about the way that you check out and build 
				mozilla code. However, if you want to develop with the very latest code, 
				you need to check out the JavaScript development branch:</P>
			<P>If you would like to use the JS engine, but only with comparitively stable 
				versions of JavaScript, don't use the development branch; use the trunk 
				version, i.e.</P>
			<BLOCKQUOTE> 
				<PRE>cvs co -A mozilla/js/src</PRE>
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P> However, if you want to develop with the very latest JS engine, you'll 
				need to check out the JavaScript development branch:</P>

			<BLOCKQUOTE> 
				<PRE>cd mozilla/js/src; cvs up -rSpiderMonkey140_BRANCH</PRE>
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>(For the curious, SpiderMonkey is the internal code name that we use 
				for the JavaScript engine written in C.) </P>

			</TABLE>
			<P>From Rick Gessner, we have this info:</P>
			<P>A great deal has changed in NGLayout:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI> Plugins are online</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI>Applets are coming online</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI>CSS1 property support continues to improve</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI>NGLayout-Mac is finally up and running</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI>DOM level 1 is coming online</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI>Performance is up</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>Troy Chevalier sent a note with some updates on the work of specific 
				programmers:</P>
			<P>Kipp:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>Landed the revised block & inline code: refactoring of the code with 
					better code reuse; better left/right margin support, and better handling 
					of blocks inside of inlines Part of this work included reworking the 
					way that list-items work, both the way that they position themselves 
					and the way that bullets are placed and the way that bullets are numbered.</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI>Hooked up the content attribute change methods to the document/presentation-shell/frame 
					system. Consequently, setting attributes from the DOM (Javascript or 
					C++) will now trigger the appropriate layout response. Note that only 
					a few frame classes have been modified and only a few attributes are 
					hooked up.</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>Troy:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>Completed frame construction changes. Moved handling of ContentDeleted 
					and ContentReplaced notifications into the style system.</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI>Removed mFirstContentOffset, mLastContentOffset, mLastContentIsComplete, 
					and mChildCount from nsContainerFrame. Eventually nsContainerFrame will 
					go away and what little is left will be merged into nsHTMLContainerFrame</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>Steve:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>Added support for table-layout=fixed. We completely skip pass 1 reflow 
					and doesn't require max-element-size which substantially speeds up initial 
					table reflow</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI>Moved all frame initialization (and related logic) into the various 
					table frame Init() member functions </LI>
				<P> 
			</UL>
			<P>Here's more detail on the Mac NGLayout progress that Done Cone submitted 
				to the checkin newsgroup: &quot;You can now break out your macs and see 
				Raptor -- LAYOUT Raptor Mac now builds(again) and lays out.</P>
			<UL>
				<LI> Double buffering is not working, so to actually SEE it layout you 
					need to uncomment out the #define NO_DOUBLE_BUFFER in nsViewManager.cpp 
					in the viewer project.</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI> Updated the widget library for resizing and widget placement.</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI> Images now load but local files need a special hack (different path, 
					local file syntax). But it works!!! I basically put in a hard coded 
					image path c string into nsFrameImageLoader::Init's method.</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI> Animated images flicker alot, need to fix this also.</LI>
				<P> 
				<LI> Some widget placement problems. I know what the problem is, just 
					need to fix.&quot;</LI>

				<LI> The merging of the OS/2 backend code modifications on the OS2_BRANCH 
					is underway. Henry Sobotka has successfully merged the OS2_BRANCH changes 
					onto the tip and I am now in the process of creating a new OS2_MERGE_BRANCH 
					with that code. Once it is proven to build on the other platforms and 
					changes are approved by module owners, it will be checked in. You can 
					read more about Henry's efforts at <A HREF="http://www.axess.com/users/sobotka/nsprtest/wzbldpjs.htm">http://www.axess.com/users/sobotka/nsprtest/wzbldpjs.htm</A>.</LI><P>
				<LI> John Fairhurst has (almost singlehandedly) built an OS/2 front-end 
					so we have what appears to be the first successful port of Mozilla to 
					a "new" platform. You can get your own copy of the executable, and the 
					sources, at John's web site: <A HREF="http://thor.cam.ac.uk/%7Emjf35/warpzilla/">http://thor.cam.ac.uk/~mjf35/warpzilla/</A>.</LI><P>
				<LI> The OS/2 porting team has decided to base their browser on the "new 
					generation layout" engine.</LI><P>
				<LI> All this progress has resulted in renewed enthusiasm on the part 
					of OS/2 developers and users. Read more about it on the mozilla-os2 
					mailing list or at news:netscape.public.mozilla.os2.</LI>
