<li>
Ben fixed 5 nsbeta1+ bookmarks bugs.</li>

Matt fixed a case when sidebar search results would not show up.</li>

<li>
Alec landed initial version of mozilla -preloader, not yet hooked up 
to build.</li>

<li>
Chris helped chase down three blocker crash bugs.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Issues</b>

<ul>
<li>
Tree closed till late evening PST meant people could not check in code
easily.</li>

<li>
Alec's mozilla -preloader work will not be ready for nsbeta1.</li>

<li>
Ben - unable to check in a fix for "bookmarks do not show in sidebar bug"
because the file gives weird CVS warnings and won't let him commit. He'll
talk to leaf on Monday and see if he
can get rid of the conflicting file on the CVS server or something
so he can
check in his copy.
<li>
Paul investigated 76705, application level improvements to startup and
feels that there is no low hanging fruit on the apps side to reduce the
time to load our chrome on startup.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Project Management</b>

<ul>
<li>
Completed triage of  hang, crash, topcrash, compat, perf, topperf,
footprint, mlk, top100, dataloss bugs.</li>

<li>
Need to add triage of mozilla0.9.2, mozilla0.9.1, mozilla0.9 keyword nominations.</li>

<li>
Need to push untriaged nominations to zero and mozilla0.9.1 scheduled to
real beta stopping list.</li>

<p><b>Individual Progress Summaries (not entire reports)</b>

<ul>
<li>Alec Flett
    <ul>
<li>Highlights:
<ul>
  <li> landed initial version of preloader, not hooked up to build
<li> have many tweaks and updates in my tree to improve it
<li> fixed my fast-update.pl script to pull new directories (previous
it only picked up existing ones)
    </ul>
<li>Lowlights:
    <ul>
<li> have been unable to hook preloader into build because tree remained
closed W/T/F until after 7pm (and generally I'm just not near
a computer after 7pm!)
<li> after some analysis, realized that mozilla-based preloader will probably
not be ready for beta 1.
    </ul>
<li>Issues:
    <ul>
<li> 0.9.2 plate is getting pretty full, I need to start doing
some triage..
    </ul>
    </ul>

<li>Anatoliy Averbukh
    <ul>
<li> got r= for bug 76512 (a feature), continue landing,
    doing bug 77635
    </ul>

<li>Ben Goodger
    <ul>
<li>Bugs fixed:
    <ul>
<li> 77523 fixed checkboxes in winhooks panel that were broken
      by my earlier checkin
<li> 76502 make delete work in bookmarks
<li> 65063 'Smartfind queries' bookmarks cause infinite loop &amp; hang
<li> 76618 IE favorites shown as single bookmark in manager/menu
<li> 76964 Bookmark clipboard operations don't work
<li> 77400 Add Bookmark As should be FIle Bookmark (patch from stephend)
<li> 79924 js errors in add bookmark dialog
<li> 79925 redundant popupset in bookmark sidebar panel
<li> 79948 Fix prefwindow size and make it non-resizable
<li> 79949 Rearrange wording in navigator panel so more buttons can be
viewed in toolbar customization listing
    </ul>
<li>Comments:
    <ul>
<li> Browser is feeling really snappy, at least on my super-hi-po machine.
<li> Context menu bug is irritating but hyatt has just found a
    fix for it.
    </ul>
<li>Other:
    <ul>
<li> Got Silvia back. She's as good as new.
<li> Found note under windshield wiper when returning to car after a lecture:
<i>"Dear Motorist,
The parking meter people are very jealous of your car. We have decided
that
if you do not leave us a $10 donation each time you park, we will begin
scratching your paint. If you continue not to pay us, we will have
you towed.
Do not fool with us, we know where you live. -- The
    Attendants."</i>
    </ul>
    </ul>

<li>Bill Law
    <ul>
<li>Highlights
    <ul>
<li> Coded up implementation of "mozilla -server" to launch at Windows
startup and open a hidden browser window.
<li> Whittled down my mozilla0.9.1 list.
    </ul>
<li>Other Activities
<ul>
<li> Looked at billions and billions of bugs related to the new helper
app
dialog.  Seriously, there are probably 10 or 12, with a fair number
of
dups that had to be sorted through.
<li> Coded fix for bug 79231 (and bug 79356).
<li> Worked on fixing bug 68279 (security flaw in the way we open
downloaded .exe files on Windows); I inherit all these by virtue of
having last touched the UI that people see when the problem occurs,
I
guess :-).
<li> Reviewed a patch or two.
    </ul>
    </ul>
    
<li>Chris McAfee
    <ul>
<li>Bugs:
    <ul>
<li> chased blockers:
<ul><li>    79711 - linux crash on startup</ul>
<li>  fixed:
<li>  reviewed:
<ul><li>    73491 - patch for embed crash on startup</ul>
<li>  argued:
<ul><li>    80304 - fixed pref window size</ul>
</ul>
<li>Other stuff:
    <ul>
<li>  Sheriff Wednesday afternoon/evening
<li>  The usual tinderbox restart hacking
<li>  Disk drive showed up
<li>  Used recent builds pretty much all the time, number of crashes was up
    from last week.  Filed a few of the blockers,
including the
    patch-submit-doesn't-work (80424), how ironic is
that.
    </ul>
<li>Comments:
    <ul>
<li>  I spent several hours every day last week except Monday
    hunting down crashers, trying to open the tree,
    talking to sheriffs, etc.  This was an amazingly
    unproductive time for me, and everyone else I
    think.
    </ul>
    </ul>

<li>Joseph Elwell
    <ul>
<li> Checked in fixes for bugs 3918.
    </ul>

<li>Matt Fisher
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes
      <ul>
<li>  73238 Search results not displaying in sidebar
<li>  76544 Basic sidebar search is non-functional
<li>  3119 Incorrect default Internet Search in preferences
<li>  4758 What's related tab needs to revert to super old 6.0 tab
<li>  3856 Browser.search.defaulturl is overriding the otherSearchURL
</ul>
<li>Worked on Bugs
    <ul>
<li>  4936 Attended meeting with really nice search people to talk
about sherlock files.  Need to track down new sherlocks files with
Claudius.
<li>  4589 Did inquisitive research on how to track people though
the use of Sherlock files.  Lookied in to extending sherlock to add
new URL for different actions.  Also talked to Netscape.com co-workers
in order to understand better how they do tracking on
  server.  Also did research on how to track users by using
internet keywords.
    </ul>
<li>Issues
    <ul>
<li>Tree has been broken 4 days in a row and closed most of business hours.
<li>If this continues into next week we will not hit Phil's date and still
having a quality product.
<li>Either the date needs to change,  accept the quality will be lower,
or we need to keep the tree open.  Personally, i think it would be
very usefully to get people who don't have nsbeta1+ bugs to help the
sheriff's work on opening the tree then having them fix more
bugs.  We should assign deputies like the old 4.0 days.

<li>Paul Chen

<li>Bugs:
    <ul>
<li>76705 application-level improvements to startup
-    So I've been looking at this one for a while, and
I've personally
come to the conclusion that navigator is a very rich UI and there's
not
too much we can do to significantly speed up startup time aside from
the unrealistic method of bringing up no chrome.
<li>    At the Thursday performance meeting, it was decided
that we start
from a minimal navigator.xul file and incrementally add features to
see
where the time goes. I was tasked with making this file, and I've got
"fastnav.xul" and "fastnav.js" in my local tree. Once I check it in,
people need to manually set a pref "browser.chromeURL" to
"chrome://navigator/content/fastnav.xul" to get this "minimal" chrome.
<li>    At the moment, fastnav.xul implements the main toolbar
and that's
about it. I will post the files very soon to get r= and sr=.

<li>78262: Password manager won't delete certain passwords

<li>Fixed but awaiting review:
    <ul>
<li>53403: Dropping multiple bookmark folders into child folder
         deletes folder.
      This bug was recently fixed for the
case of a single
         folder but it just
got reopened for multiple folders
      (waiting for response from reviewer
since 5-8)
<li>62730: Make form-manager data-collection conform to local customs.
      Finally got it reviewed after waiting
two weeks, but now
        l10n is changing their mind
about what they want.

 character" within the tags' attributes (i.e., between "&lt;" and "&gt;"
since  string we are manipulating is HTML output string)! This trashes any
source  that has attributes set. :-( Any regexp experts who can help would
be appreciated!   </li>

<p><b>Summary</b>
<ul>
<li>
After much hard work completing features over the last couple of weeks,
the accessibility branch has now landed in the mozilla trunk,  enabling
basic MSAA support in Gecko.  Let's all give a big 'thank you!' to
Eric Vaughan, Aaron Leventhal, John Gaunt and Rod Spears for getting this
done in time to land for 0.9.1.  We are now finishing off some remaining
details, and working with major AT vendors to ensure smooth interoperability
with MSAA clients.</li>

<li>
Mike Pinkerton landed drag&amp;drop support for outliner widgets.</li>

<li>
Mike also posted another Fizilla build (Carbon-ated mozilla, for MacOS
X )</li>

<li>

	  <blockquote>

<p>We finally landed the new XP region code which will
	  give us region support on par with other platforms. It
	  should enable us to better support the new view
	  manager. Thanks to Dainis Jonitis for this effort.
	  Note that any platform can use this if their native
	  region code is not up to par.

<p>	  We also have most issues resolved with the new image
	  library.

<p>	  Our main issue right now is trying to get our PSM and
	  NSS changes checked in. We are continuing to work with
	  the crypto team on this. Once this is done, our
	  nightly builds can contain security.

<p>	  We are also attempting to start putting nightly builds
	  up consistently.
	  <a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/latest/mozilla-i386-pcos2-vacpp.zip">This</a>
	  will always be the latest nightly. We will not be
	  keeping archives right now.

<p>	  Bidi is now officially turned on in the build. We are
	  working to resolve some regressions and miscellaneous
	  issues that have come up. We are also working on
	  getting the approvals to put the user interface in
	  (new pref panel and menu).

<p>	  Note that the cross-platform Arabic shaping is not in
	  the build yet. Arabic only works on platforms that
	  support Bidi.
