<li>Highlights
    <ul>
      <li>     "Resume" support completed in
	  libxpnet.
    </ul>
<li>Accomplishments
    <ul>
<li>     Added blocking functionality to the mac nsIProcess::Run
(for use with XPInstall and third party silent installers: at least a mac
version of RealPlayer is in the pipe).
<li>     Added FTP resume support to libxpnet (pause
is for free).
<li>     Added HTTP resume support to libxpnet (pause
if for free).  Expecting HTTP/1.1 and taking advantage of byte ranges.
<li>     Helped Ying-lin with mac installer i18n changes
(moving binary string resources to text files that use our mac INI parser).
<li>     Help Ian with new help system build/packaging
process.
</ul>
<li>Current Work
    <ul>
<li>     Finish mozilla0.9 bugs.
<li>     Integrate libxpnet pause/resume into mac and
linux installers.
<li>     Finish helping Ian with getting the new help
system turned on as a default xp extension.
    </ul>
    </ul>
<li><b>William Law</b>
    <ul>
<li> Worked on new helper app dialog.
<li> IDL-ized nsINativeAppSupport to further some upcoming bug fixing
and
feature work.
<li> Got dragged kicking and screaming into more discussions about the
ill-fated "Print Preview" feature.
<li> Went to poorly-attended and less than rousing "Catfood Can Opener"
meeting.
<li> Thanks to Paul Chen for graciously receiving and collating these
status reports over the past few weeks.
<li>Plans
    <ul>
<li> New helper app dialog.
<li> Misc other 0.9 bugs.
    </ul>

<li>reviewed some code
    </ul>
<li>lowlights
    <ul>
<li>spent 2 days installing and debugging 6.0 browser for search

    </ul>
    </ul>
<li><b>Alec Flett</b>
    <ul>
<li>Checked in:
    <ul>
<li> 60117 - generic startup mechanism for mozilla
<li> 71590 - Bookmarks properties dialog has no labels
<li> 73640 - uriloader should support true weak references
<li> 73679 - assertion on exit/crash in profile switching
<li> ?? (can't find #) - delayed history initialization until first window
has appeared - for performance
<li> lots of super reviews - finally finished reviewing cookie changes
<li> checked in bug 1995 for sicking@bigfoot.com - cool metadata properties
feature...thanks, jonas!
<li> evaluating IE6 to see how we're doing
    </ul>
<li>working on:
    <ul>
<li> more nsBrowserInstance stuff w/jag to reduce more bloat
<li> global history to be the guinea pig for the outliner - will work
with waterson next week
<li> continuing to break up &amp; reorganize our JS and XUL to allow us
to load the bare minimum from navigator.xul, as well as other
apps like mail who use our overlays
<li> drag &amp; drop into personal toolbar - kind of working in my tree,
but blows away your personal toolbar every so often.. doh!
    </ul>

      </ul>
<li><b>Steve Morse</b>
    <ul>
<li>HILITE
    <ul>
<li>Regarding the massive cookie-module reorg that I'd been working on,
last
week I reported that the light at the end of the tunnel might actually
be the headlight of an oncoming train.  Well I was wrong -- it
really
was sunlight.  Final approval was obtained and 47 files were checked
in.  This fixed 9 M0.9 bugs.
Thanks to Paul Chen for being my mac buddy in this endeavor.
    </ul>
<li>LOLITE
    <ul>
<li>I have embarqued on the same sort of changes for password-manager

<li><b>Paul Chen</b>
    <ul>
<li>Mozilla 0.9 bugs
    <ul>
<li>20943 [FEATURE] Print preview needs to be hooked up
  Marked as nsbeta1- and future. Still needs work in presentation
layer
of layout, layout has no resource to implement the work, so we don't
have functionality to hook up to, therefore this is going to miss the
train
<li>64025 Crash when changing the Show Tooltips pref
  Reassigned to pierre@netscape.com. A StyleContextImpl is getting
overwritten (well, it's mPseudoTag data member is). Style system
whackage, reassign to someone who can do a better job of fixing the
problem.
<li>65322 Separators in Personal Toolbars is displayed incorrectly
  Looked into this a little bit, still needs some work, went off
to fix
73262 because it's kinda blocking me
    </ul>
<li>Other
    <ul>
<li>73262 Crash on quitting while page is loading
  This bug was blocking me on stuff (like every time I closed
a window
on mac). This one is currently assigned to danm, I had a fix, redid
fix,
need to get r= and sr= again, but tree is still closed anyway
<li>46783 nsICookieService.h needs to be idl'ized
  Mac buddy for Steve Morse. This ate up my Wednesday afternoon
and
Thursday morning (for clean up ;-))

    <ul>
<li>Highlights:
    <ul>
<li>Fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=71590">71590</a> 
- bookmarks property dialog cleanup
<li>Found some cleanup work which allows us to consolidate 3 dlls (find,
xfer, ucth) into the appcomps dll, reducing our total dlls by 3.
These dlls were also loaded at startup, so this should speed up startup
time as well.
<li>Looks like reorganization of the Keyboard Navigation component will
free me of lots of bugs that I didn't have time to fix.
</ul>
<li>Lowlights:
    <ul>
<li>Too much tree closure == few bugs checked in
</ul>
<li>Plans:
    <ul>
<li>have fixes for many of my 0.9 bugs in my tree, was unable to check
in due to late tree openings this week.
    </ul>
    </ul>
    
<li><b>Ben Goodger</b>
<ul>
  <li>Progress:
      <ul>
<li> .9 fixes in tree for:
<li>68537 - bookmarks view doesn't automatically scroll to new folder
upon
         creation. The scrolling
problem is long fixed, however there
         was inline edit bustage
that was causing new folder creation
         (and all inline edit
operations) to fail.
<li> 71685 - bookmarks in sidebar don't load. Have renamed bookmarksPanel.xul
         back to bm-panel.xul.
<li> 57763 - textfield for email address to send as anon email pwd
not
         disabling when corresponding
checkbox unchecked.
<li> 65328 - disabling bug in bookmark properties dialog scheduling
panels.
<li> 73905 - checked in a small patch to nsHTMLContentSink that ensure
         that JS documents
are loaded from cache if they are cached,
         rather than always
reloaded. Darin checked in a similar fix
         to nsCSSLoader.
<li>Currently working on 53403, dragging folder into child folder deletes
folder (bad dataloss). I've fixed the original problem, but now I'm
suffering from a case where I seem to be trashing the container that
I
insert (correctly) into.
<li>I've come to the conclusion that the old tree widget sucks, and dealing
with it sucks. I'm looking forward to migrating the code to the outliner
widget, if possible.
    </ul>
<li> other work:
    <ul>
<li> 68539 - inline edit operations not successful (see above)
<li> 73508 - bookmarks should use the outliner widget.
         created nsIXULOutlinerBuilderObserver
so clients can implement
           outliner
event handling functions, like inline edit requests.
           (CHECKED
IN)
<li>         began adding rudimentary
inline editing support to the
           outliner
XBL binding, based on initial attempt in the XUL
           tree widget.
<li>         begun to implement
nsOutlinerBodyFrame::GetCoordsForCellItem,
           a method
which will return the rect for an item (image, text
           etc) within
a given cell. This will allow accurate positioning
           of an
inline edit field over the cell, title tips, nice
           drag and
drop feedback, marquee selection, etc.
<li>         reformatted the
outliner idl files to use correct doc
           comments.
(CHECKED IN)
<li>         Chris Waterson has
factored the XUL Template builder, creating a
         generic base class
for template generated matter, and deriving
         nsXULContentBuilder
and nsXULOutlinerBuilder from it. The
         content builder is
what we knew the old template builder to be,
         the OUtliner builder
is the analog for the outliner widget. This
         allows an outliner
to be fed by an RDF datasource.
         Clients can create
an outliner with a template in the
         &lt;outlinerbody&gt;.
Specialized applications like bookmarks have
         advanced requirements,
for instance they may need to be able to
         supply information
as to whether or not a given node is editable,
         etc. As such an interface
called nsIXULOutlinerBuilderObserver
         has been created that
allows such applications to define this
         behaviour for themselves.
</ul>
<li>Priorities:
    <ul>
<li> Get stuff still in local tree checked in:
 All those mac-classic skin changes. This is going to be a bitch
to
 merge but I want to get them in for .9.1
<li> The menupopup patch that fixes pretty much every remaining
 positioning problem with submenus.
<li> The menupopup patch from hell that implements sizable popups (yes,
 this has been gathering dust since before Christmas, time to
dust
 it off.)
<li> Give Silvia a bath, make sure to clean off bird excrement as it is
 acidic and eats paint.
    </ul>
<li>Highlights:
<ul>    
<li> DSL is installed, the internet is fast again, I can pull much more
 quickly than before.
<li> Received personalized license plates for car. Fitted them. See:
 <a href="http://www.silverstone.net.nz/photos/silvia/plate_back.jpg">http://www.silverstone.net.nz/photos/silvia/plate_back.jpg</a>
 <a href="http://www.silverstone.net.nz/photos/silvia/plate_front.jpg">http://www.silverstone.net.nz/photos/silvia/plate_front.jpg</a>
<li> Successfully completed break-in period in Silvia (1000 miles).
 Took it out tonight for a spin, tested acceleration exiting gas
 station, 1st@~20kph, 2nd@~60kph, 3rd@~80kph, 4th@~105kph, 5th@~105kph.
 The engine screams like a banshee over 5000, and accelerates
with
 brutal precision. Need to hone shifting during panicked acceleration
 as carnal instinct is to use shift pattern of an Opel Astra during
 such situations, causing the stick to hit the barrier between
3rd
 and 5th, or sometimes even go into 5th.
    </ul>
<li>Lowlights:
    <ul>
<li> My securID seems to have stopped working. I guess this means no mail
 for a little while. Please reach me at bmgoodger@aol.com while
 I wait for my new one to be sent out to me. I requested FedEx
 and they said they'd "see what they could do."
<li> Silvia has acquired a nasty scratch on her dashboard, underneath
her
 nametag. Mourned for 15 minutes, tried to figure out who was
to blame,
 but failed.
<li> Received $33 in parking fines, from fascist agents of aforementioned
 pinko commie government.

<li><b>Samir Gehani</b>
    <ul>
<li>Highlights
    <ul>
<li>     Good progress ramping down installer
    bugs.
    </ul>
<li>Accomplishments
    <ul>
<li>     Finished helping Ian with new help system build
changes.
<li>     Chased down and fixed a linux installer linkage
bug (manifested as the Java hang) caused by mozilla "configure" rule changes.
<li>     Added "auto" mode to linux installer (pass
the -ma flag on the command line) for automatic installation using defaults
with no user intervention but some
     progress UI.
<li>     Added disk space checking to the linux installer.
<li>     Good progress on integrating pause/resume
into the linux installer.
    </ul>
<li>Current Work
    <ul>
<li>     Finish mozilla0.9 bugs.
<li>     Complete integrating libxpnet pause/resume

    </ul>
<li><b>Steve Morse</b>
    <ul>
<li>LOWLITES
<ul>
<li>Most of my time was spent on four very difficult bugs (72186, 53956,
74014, and 73964) but no checkins were made on any of them.
    </ul>
<li>HILITES
<ul>
<li>Made substantial progress on the first three of these four bugs.
<li>Redid the idl for password manager to meet embedding requirements.
</ul>
<li>MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON
<ul>
<li>72186: crash if typing in before page finishes loading
       Spent time analyzing this top crasher.
       Came up with a fix for it.
       Editor team has asked that we
hold off checking in this
          fix because
it will mask another problem that they
          are currently
having.
<li>53956: bugzilla login never stops loading
       Spent time investigating this long-outstanding
bug.
       Discovered that bug goes away
by adding
          a call to RemoveDummyLayoutRequest
<li>74014: form manager dialog not working on linux and mac
       Spent time investigating and simplifying
this
       Finally reduced it to a simple
testcase which showed that it
       was related to the use of editable
menulists.  Reassigned to
       andreww who has already done a
lot of work in that area.
    </ul>
<li>FIXES CHECKED IN
<ul>
<li>70382: idl-izing the password manager interface for embedding
       Another very time-consuming change
but not quite as bad as
          the equivalent
work done on the cookie manager (bug 46783)
       Took several iterations to satisfy
all the reviewer's and
          super-reviewer's
requests
<li>74112: cookie following deleted cookie not being sent out
       This bug was uncovered during my
investigation of 73964.
       I had to fix it first so that
further investigation could
       be done on that critical bug (no
compuserve login).
<li>74089: cookie strings being displayed for images
<li>74049: cookperm file is garbled
<li>74489: crash when bringing up cookie viewer
<li>74858: cookie permissions not being read in

<li><b>Bill Law</b>
    <ul>
<li> Completed basic version of new helper app dialog.
<li> Spent 3 days hooking that dialog up to helper app add/edit dialogs
(from Prefs).  This works in general, but the dialogs cannot add/edit
the helper app entries due to mysterious RDF errors.  I'm enlisting
aid
of our RDF experts to try to figure out what's going on.
<li> Sat in on Thur Performance meeting to discuss window open Quantify
analyses I'd done.  Opened a new bug to address one issue.

<li> after picking waterson's nose^H^H^H^Hbrain, decided on and implemented 
  threadsafety strategy for nsLDAPAutoCompleteSession: marshal everything back
  to the main thread using nsISupports proxies.  Ideally, we would make 
  nsLDAPAutoCompleteSession (as well as some of the code in 
  xpfe/components/autocomplete) threadsafe instead, but there's not time for
  that now.

test for regressions that can be triggered by their changes exposing bugs

don't check it in!</ul>

<p><b>Summary</b>

<ul>
<li>
The XPCDOM landing will not happen before the 0.9 tree freeze.  Leak
fixing, security manager integration, and plugin scriptability are tasks
that remain.  We will collect performance, stability, and footprint
reduction data as we get closer to finishing these tasks.</li>

<li>
The XML/DOM team is over Marek's 0.9 bug limit.  We will triage our
0.9 bugs this week to get back within the limit.</li>
