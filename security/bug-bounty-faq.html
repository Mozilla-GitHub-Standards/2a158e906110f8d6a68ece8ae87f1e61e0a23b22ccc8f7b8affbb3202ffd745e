</ul>
<h2>General questions</h2>
<dl class="qandaset">
<dt><a class="question" name="why">Why is the Mozilla Foundation
doing this?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>Because we want to encourage more people to find and report
security bugs in our products, so that we can make our products even
more secure than they already are. It's as simple as that.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="question" name="netscape">Is this related to the
Netscape bugs bounty program?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>No. This program is a completely independent initiative
sponsored and run by the Mozilla Foundation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="question" name="eligibility">Are Mozilla developers
eligible for the bug bounty reward?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>Yes. Anyone is eligible to receive a reward except for Mozilla
Foundation employees and the creators and reviewers of the code in
which the bug was found. However, as noted in the policy, if you found
this bug as part of your job (in other words, while being paid to work
on Mozilla) then we'd appreciate it if you would not apply for the
bounty, in order to preserve our limited funds for rewarding volunteer
contributors.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Eligible software</h2>
<dl class="qandaset">
<dt><a class="question" name="other-products">Can I get the bug
bounty reward if I discover a bug in Camino, Galeon, K-Meleon, Netscape
7, or other products based on Mozilla code?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>Only if we can reproduce the problem in the most recent version
of the Mozilla Suite, Firefox, and/or Thunderbird.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="question" name="bugzilla-etc">Does the bug bounty cover
bugs found in Bugzilla, Tinderbox, Bonsai, and other software created
and distributed as part of the Mozilla project?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>No. We have decided to use our limited resources to focus on our
end-user products, as opposed to the other software produced and used
by the Mozilla project.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="question" name="most-recent">What do you mean by the
"most recent version" of the Mozilla Suite, Firefox, and/or Thunderbird?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>In general we mean the releases available for download on the <a
href="/download.html">mozilla.org download page</a> at the time the
bug was reported. However we will also consider paying rewards for
security bugs found in <a href="#development-releases">development
releases</a> (i.e., alpha, beta, and nightly releases) and select <a
href="#older-releases">older releases</a>, as discussed in the
questions and answers below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="question" name="older-releases">Can I get the bug
bounty reward if I discover a bug in an older release of the Mozilla
Suite, Firefox, and/or Thunderbird?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>In general bugs found in earlier releases are eligible for a
reward only if we can reproduce the problem using the most recent
version.</p>
<p>However as a special exception we will also consider paying
rewards for bugs found in the most recent releases from designated
stable branches (e.g., from the Mozilla 1.7 branch after 1.8 is
released) if the bugs are not present in the most recent version but
were never recognized and fixed as security bugs. (For example, the bug
might be in code associated with a feature that was removed and/or
heavily modified in the most recent version, and might have been
"fixed" solely as a byproduct of other unrelated changes.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="question" name="development-releases">Can I get the bug
bounty reward if I discover a bug in an alpha or beta release or a
nightly build of the Mozilla Suite, Firefox, and/or Thunderbird?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>Yes, as long as the bug otherwise meets the published bug bounty
program guidelines. (In particular, the bug must be reproducible in the
latest nightly build and not previously reported.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="question" name="third-party-releases">Can I get the bug
bounty reward if I discover a bug that occurs in a third-party release
of the Mozilla Suite, Firefox, and/or Thunderbird (e.g., a localized
build, optimized build, or third-party Mozilla, Firefox, or Thunderbird
distribution)?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>Yes, if the bug can be reproduced in an official Mozilla
Foundation release and otherwise meets the published guidelines.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="question" name="platform-specific">Can I get the bug
bounty reward if I discover a bug that occurs only on a particular
operating system?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>Yes, if the operating system is officially supported by the most
recent version of the product for which you're reporting the bug. (For
a list of supported operating systems and hardware configurations see
the system requirements for the <a href="/mozilla1.x/sysreq.html">Mozilla
Suite</a>, <a href="/products/firefox/system-requirements.html">Firefox</a>,
and <a href="/products/thunderbird/sysreq.html">Thunderbird</a>.)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Eligible bugs</h2>
<dl class="qandaset">
<dt><a class="question" name="critical-bugs">What types of security
bugs do you consider to be "critical"?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>In general we consider critical security bugs to be those that
allow execution of arbitrary code on users' systems or that otherwise
allow access to users' confidential information. In the latter case we
consider bugs to be critical only if they potentially expose high-value
personal information (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers, and the
like); in the context of the bug bounty program we do not consider bugs
to be critical if they potentially expose only lower-value information
(e.g., browsing history) or information that would be useful primarily
for other exploits (e.g., the names of files or directories on the
user's system).</p>
<p>Finally, in general we do not consider bugs that allow denial of
service attacks to be critical in the sense described above.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="question" name="dos-bugs">Why won't you provide a
reward for denial of service bugs?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>Because DoS bugs are generally less serious than other security
bugs (e.g., they typically do not lead to corruption or destruction of
user data, much less theft of data), and in many cases a DoS attack
does not involve an actual bug but simply misuse of standard product
features (e.g., putting up a web site with an excessive number of
graphics, sending excessively long mail messages, etc.). We have
decided to concentrate our limited resources on rewarding people who
find what we consider to be more serious security problems.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Bug reporting, etc.</h2>
<dl class="qandaset">
<dt><a class="question" name="already-published">I've already
published information about the bug, and didn't go through the Mozilla
bug process; can I still get a reward?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>Yes, as long as the bug report occurred after the official
announcement of the bug bounty program on August 2, 2004, and otherwise
meets the published bug bounty program guidelines (e.g., the bug has
not been reported previously and is reproducible in the most recent
version of the affected product).</p>
<p>However we do encourage people to <a
href="mailto:security@mozilla.org?subject=Security%20exploit%20submission">report
bugs directly</a> to the Mozilla project, in order to ensure that the
bug is made known as soon as possible to the people who can fix it.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="question" name="nondisclosure">If I report the bug
directly to you, do I have to keep the bug confidential and not publish
information about it in order to receive a reward?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>No. We're rewarding you for finding a bug, not trying to buy
your silence. However if you report the bug through the standard
Mozilla process and haven't already published information about it then
we do ask that you follow the guidelines set forth in the official
policy on <a href="/projects/security/security-bugs-policy.html">handling
Mozilla security bugs</a>. Under this policy security-sensitive bug
reports in our Bugzilla system may be kept private for a limited period
of time to give us a chance to fix the bug before the bug is made
public, with an option for the bug reporter (or others) to open the bug
to public view earlier whenever circumstances warrant it (e.g., if your
bug report is being completely ignored).</p>
</dd>
<dt><a class="question" name="cooperation">I don't have the time or
desire to work with you further in investigating and fixing the bug;
can I still get a bug bounty reward?</a></dt>
<dd class="answer">
<p>Yes. Again, we're rewarding you for finding a bug, not trying to
buy your cooperation. However we do invite you to work together with
us, and we hope that you'll accept that offer in the spirit in which it
was intended. In return you'll get the opportunity to work as a full
member of the team fixing your bug and see "from the inside" exactly
how Mozilla security bugs get resolved.</p>
