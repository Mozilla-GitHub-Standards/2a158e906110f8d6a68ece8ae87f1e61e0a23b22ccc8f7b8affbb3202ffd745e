 <h1>JavaScript XPCOM Components Status - Draft 2</h1>
 <div class="section">
  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
In the document <a href="xpjs-components.html">XPJS Components Proposal</a> I
proposed that we build a system for implementing xpcom components and services
in JavaScript - components that could be used transparently by any other xpcom
components.

<p>
<a href="mailto:shaver@mozilla.org">Mike Shaver</a> has since done the
work to make this system work. This document will explain the status of that
work and will try to detail the limitations of the system as currently implemented.

 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>
The system, of course, is all based on <a href="index.html">XPConnect</a>. The
main innovation was in factoring out the system that xpcom uses to instantiate
components. Previously there was a builtin component loader that assumed that
all components were implemented in C/C++ and either loaded from a DLL or via
factory instances registered (non-persistently) at runtime. Mike broke this code
out to build a plugable component loader system. He then wrote one loader for native
components loaded from DLLs and one for JavaScript components loaded from .js
files. This is an extensible system and we can expect that others will write
additional loaders in the future.

<p>
The JS component loader implementation is in <a
href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/js/src/xpconnect/loader/">/js/src/xpconnect/loader/</a>.
As far as I know Mike Shaver did not write any detailed documentation about its
use. In a nutshell... It will try to load for registration and use as a
component any .js files it discovers in the 'components' directory during
autoregistration time; i.e. the same directory where native components in DLLs
are located. I'm not sure if it will attempt to discover these files everytime
the app is started or only during autoregistration [shaver clarification?].

<p>
The best document that I know of is in the sample at <a
href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpcom/sample/nsSample.js">xpcom/sample/nsSample.js</a>.
I think it worth noting that this is both a sample and a bit of a test bed.
There is some unnecessary debug code. And the boilerplate code really ought to
be reorganized a bit with the customizable part broken out as separate variables
so that future JS component implementors can just copy the common blocks and
fill in their own strings for progids and iids etc. Nevertheless, it is the sample we have and the comments in the sample explain how to use the system.

<p>
An additional source of info on the evolution of the system (for the hardcore
curious) is the discussions on the <a
href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.xpcom">xpcom
newsgroup</a>. Search the  subjects for keywords like: JS components, component
loader.

<p>
Any .js file that shows up in the components directory is a likely example of JS
component usage. Currently, there is a sidebar component. Mike Shaver had
implemented the category manager using JS, but it was reimplemented in C++. Not
because its implementation in JS was not viable, but simply because it was
decided that xpcom should not have a core service which required JavaScript and
XPConnect. This would have limited xpcom's usefulness in some non-browser
embeddings where JavaScript might not otherwise be needed or wanted.

 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h2 id="unwrapping">Unwrapping</h2>

<p>
Until 1 August 2000 there was a 'killer' problem with JS Components... When used
by JS code they did not 'look' like other xpcom components. The source of this
problem was that xpconnect was giving the calling JS code direct access to the
underlying JSObject of the JS Component. This meant that the caller had access
to all of the methods and properties of the JS Component and was not limited by
the declared interface. It also meant that other xpconnect infrastructure did
not recognize the 'unwrapped' JS Component as being an implementation of any given
xpcom interface. See the discussion of these problems  <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25180">here</a>.

<p>
In the long run this will be fixed by a third sort of xpconnect wrapper which is
specialized for this purpose. In the short run it was decided to 'double wrap'
the JS Components when they are handed to JS code from native code. This means
that when the JS Component is created and handed to native code xpconnect builds
a wrapper to be used by the native code AND when that wrapper is later handed to
JS code then xpconnect builds a wrapper around that wrapper for use from JS.
This makes the JS Component nearly indistinguishable from native xpcom
components. But there is one difference....

<p id="wrappedJSObject">
It is anticipated that in some rare cases the calling JS code might actually
<strong>need</strong> to get access to the underlying JSObject of the JS Component. For
this purpose xpconnect wrappers around xpcom components now support a property
named <i>wrappedJSObject</i>. This allows JS code to do something like...

<pre class="code">// 'foo' is an xpcom object that *might* be implemented in JS
var underlyingObject = foo.wrappedJSObject;
if(underlyingObject) {
   underlyingObject.somePropertyThatIsNotPartOfTheInterface = 'bar';
}</pre>

<p>
If 'foo' is not implemented in JS then <i>foo.wrappedJSObject</i> will return
<i>undefined</i>. Also, even if 'foo' <i>is</i> implemeneted in JS this will
only succeed if the underlying JSObject has a property called 'wrappedJSObject'
which is set to a JSObject (typically the <i>this</i> of the JSObject). This
means that only JS Componets that want to expose their underlying JSObject can
be unwrapped this way. It also allows for those objects to return some
<b>other</b> JSObject if they choose. XPConnect also supports having the
security system do a special check before allowing this activity to succeed.
But, for now, all such XPConnect activities are gated only they the
<i>UniversalXPConnect</i> 'super-privilege'.

  <h2>Bugs</h2>

<ul>

<li><del><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24688">24688</a> -
runtime errors in wrapped JS are not made obvious</del> (FIXED) </li>

<li>
 <p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25180">25180</a> -
xpconnect needs wrappers for JS -> JS communication

<p>
I've checked in an interim solution which 'double wraps' JS components when they
are handed back to Js code. This is not particulary efficient. But it is better
that simply unwrapping the JSObject as we did before.</li>

<li><del><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=27867">27867</a> -
xpconnect does not always work well with DOM objects</del> (FIXED)</li>

</ul>

 </div>
 <div class="section">
  <h2>Conclusions and Recommendations</h2>

<p>
I think that JavaScript components have a bright future. There are  limitations
that one must be aware of - especially when working with the DOM. But, JS
Components are appropriate for many tasks.
