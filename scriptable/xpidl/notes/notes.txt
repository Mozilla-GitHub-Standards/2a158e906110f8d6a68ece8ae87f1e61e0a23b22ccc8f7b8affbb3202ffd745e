/* jband - 04/03/99 -  */

This is a list of terse notes about xpidl to aid in producing docs. TODOs are
also included.

Mostly just look at the keywords list and examples and do experiments.

We need to use...
http://www.mozilla.org/scriptable/interface-rules-we-break.html
...to get interfaces transfered.


I included nsrootidl.idl and nsISupports.idl here mostly to make the examples 
compile.

Note that xpidl's generation of #include "nsrootidl.h" forces us to make that 
file available and to make it do nothing.

Promote types used in nsrootidl.idl. Evolve that file!

idl enums are not supported. Use 'const'. Only short and long supported (with
unsigned variations). 
See: news://news.mozilla.org/36FEBE43.E1F8969D%40netscape.com

My examples are just a start. Expand and refine as desired.

Ask me questions :)


TODO:
- find a place for nsrootidl.idl
- add more warnings for unsupported Corba stuff in xpidl
- Work out the nsISupports stuff
    - alecf's nsID struct is bad.
    - nsISupports.h has special Mac stuff, don't overwrite it.
-I'd like to see NS_ERROR_xxx being declared in idl (see xpccomponents.idl)
