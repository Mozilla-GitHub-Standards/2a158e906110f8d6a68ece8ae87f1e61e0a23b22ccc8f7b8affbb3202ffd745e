<h3>Introduction</h3>

This is a proposal for how I think libxpt (the typelib file read/write code) ought
to manage Interface Directory Entries. These entries are the critical link
points between type information of one interface and that of another. These
entries also delineate the appropriate level of granularity for runtime
management and incremental loading/unloading of type information. It is
important that we implement an interface which allows us to work with the
entries in a flexible manner. 

<p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<ul>

<li>Support build time linking of partially resolved type libraries.

<li>Support run time linking of partially resolved type libraries.

<li>Support runtime incremental loading/unloading of type information

</ul>

<p>

<h3>Proposal</h3>

<p>

I propose that our runtime representation of the Interface Directory Entry
structure be somewhat different from the file format representation. It should
distinguish between the file offset of the Interface Descriptor and the in-memory pointer to the struct representing that descriptor. It should also allow
for storing the pointer to a different Interface Directory Entry which is fully
resolved.

<p>

<pre>

typedef enum XPTResolveMode {
    XPT_UNRESOLVED_NAME_ONLY,
    XPT_UNRESOLVED_HAVE_IID,
    XPT_RESOLVED_OFFSET,
    XPT_RESOLVED_DESC_PTR,
    XPT_RESOLVED_FORWARD_PTR
} XPTResolveMode;

struct XPTInterfaceDirectoryEntry {
    uint128                iid;
    char                   *name;
    char                   *namespace;
    int32                  interface_descriptor_offset;
    XPTResolveMode         resolve_mode;
    union {
        XPTInterfaceDescriptor     *interface_descriptor;
        XPTInterfaceDirectoryEntry *interface_entry_forward;
    }
};

</pre>

For XPConnect I plan to have an object (call it the InterfaceInfoOwner) which
manages multiple typelib files (or streams). The InterfaceInfoOwner will open
each file, read in the file header, the array of Interface Directory Entries,
and whatever annotations the files might have. It will not initially need to
read in any Interface Descriptor. <i>Note: we may choose to partition the set of
typelib files such that commonly used interfaces (e.g. DOM interfaces) are
grouped into specific files and eagerly loaded.</i> Whenever the
InterfaceInfoOwner needs to resolve a class (i.e. get its Interface Descriptor)
it traverses the arrays of Entries looking for a match and loading the graph of
descriptor information from file if necessary.

<p>

Interface Directory Entries are also 'found' when they are referenced by other
entry; either as the parent_interface of an interface, or as a param type. These
referenced entries may be unresolved (in that the interface descriptor really
'lives' in some other typelib file). In this case we want to find that resolved
entry, load up the descriptor information (if not already loaded), update the reference to point this
resolved entry, and also set the <code>interface_entry_forward</code> field of the unresolved
entry to point to the resolved entry so that future lookups can be sped up.

<p>

XPTInterfaceDirectoryEntry are low level structs. The InterfaceInfoOwner will
produce nsInterfaceInfo XPCOM objects which will wrap these structs (by pointer
and delegation, not inheritance). When released InterfaceInfo objects could
cleanup the graph of the interface_descriptor for the wrapped Entry. All the
descriptor objects could be free'd and the Entry set back to the state it was
before loading them (i.e. a valid offset into the file where the descriptor
lives, but no other in memory information). This will give us safe incremental
loading and unloading.

<p>

The linker will do much the same work. It will load up all the arrays of entries
from multiple files, iteratively setup all the 'forwards' from unresolved to
resolved entities, deal with multiply defined interfaces - checking that they
are identical and merging references, load all the descriptors (doing fixups to
forwarded references), merge all the duplicated strings, and write the whole
mess out as one file (or partitioned in some interesting way?).

<p>

<b>I suggest one change to the typelib spec:</b> I think that the
InterfaceDirectoryEntry* references used for param types and for
parent_interfaces (and any others?) ought to be indexes into the
InterfaceDirectoryEntry table rather than data_pool offsets. This will make it
easier to do incremental loads after the InterfaceDirectoryEntry table has been
loaded into memory. Instead of using the file offset to get to the Entry in the
file and then having to figure out the mapping from that to the Entry in memory,
we can just use the index to go directly to the entry in the table whether it be
in the file or in memory.

<p>

I think that this is all easier (and more sensible) than I manage to describe it
above. I'd be happy to speak at length with the implementers (shaver/coop) about
the hows and whys.
