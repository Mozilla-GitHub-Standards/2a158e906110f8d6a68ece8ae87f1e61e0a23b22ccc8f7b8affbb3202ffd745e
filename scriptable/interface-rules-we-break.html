<h3>Introduction</h3>

This is a list with commentary of the XPCOM interface rules that I see being
broken in our code.  Much code is written as if the XPCOM interfaces were
nothing more than C++ virtual base classes. So far, people have been able to get
away with that. But these patterns simply will not do as we convert to xpidl,
make more interfaces scriptable via XPConnect, and move toward proxy generation
for an apartment threading model, or for remoting.

<p>

This does not generally address possible issues with how we <b>use</b> XPCOM and
the interfaces, but instead focuses on how we <b>declare</b> interfaces. A much
deeper analysis would be required to uncover problems with how interfaces are
used (and where XPCOM rules might be being broken; e.g. refcounting errors,
casting instead of using <code>QueryInterface</code>, Implementing objects that
break XPCOM identity rules, etc).

<p>

<ul>

<li><b>C++ default params</b><blockquote> A number of interfaces declare C++
default param values in their method declarations. This can not be done in xpidl
and makes no sense outside of in-process direct C++ to C++ calling. It is
simply not XPCOM interface compliant.</blockquote>

<li><b>Methods that are not declared NS_IMETHOD</b><blockquote>Many
methods are accessors methods. The <i>proper</i> way to implement
this in XPCOM is to use an <code>out</code> parameter. Admittedly, this makes for
an awkward method usage. But this is how XPCOM works. Many interface
authors have chosen to cut this corner. They write:

<pre>NS_IMETHOD_(int) GetFoo() = 0;</pre>

or worse...

<pre>virtual int GetFoo() = 0;</pre>

where they should be writing...

<pre>NS_IMETHOD GetFoo(/*out*/ int* foo) = 0;</pre>

The return type of <code>nsresult</code> (hidden in <code>NS_IMETHOD</code>) is
critical for XPConnect and future proxy use. It should be used in <b>all</b>
public interface unless there is a very strong overriding reason.

<p>

In the (very) few cases where it is not appropriate to return
<code>nsresult</code>, it is important that the <code>NS_IMETHOD_()</code> macro
be used. Some code, as shown above, does things like <code>virtual int</code>.
The <code>NS_IMETHOD_()</code> macro does more than expand to
<code>virtual</code>, it also declares the correct calling convention on some
platforms. It should be used. I don't think it is ever appropriate for the
keyword <code>virtual</code> to appear in an XPCOM interface header.

<p>

Some code tries to be tricky by returning semantically meaningful results
in the <code>nsresult</code>...

<pre>NS_IMETHOD IsEnabled() = 0;</pre>

Users are expected to interpret a return value of <code>NS_OK</code> to mean one
thing and any failure code to mean another. This pattern also will break
down when used in XPConnect or across a proxy. The proxy uses the failure code
for its own purposes and the intended result may not be passed through as
expected. Don't do this. Use <code>out</code> params.</blockquote>


<li><b>Non-XPCOM interface listeners</b><blockquote>There are a
few pieces of code that declare listener interfaces where the
listener interfaces are not XPCOM interfaces. If these listeners
were declared as XPCOM interfaces then listeners could be implemented
using XPConnect.</blockquote>


<li><b>C++ templates in XPCOM interface
declarations</b><blockquote><code>nsIFrameReflow</code> does this. I don't know
why.</blockquote>

<li><b>C++ operator overloading in XPCOM interface
declarations</b><blockquote><code>nsITokenObserver</code> does this. I don't
know why.</blockquote>

<li><b>varargs</b><blockquote>One or two interfaces use <code>'...'</code> params.
 This is not valid XPCOM. We've discussed possible workarounds. I
 don't know what replacement for this will be decided upon.</blockquote>

<li><b>Marking a method <code>const</code></b><blockquote>This is a
normal C++ idiom to indicate that calling the given method will not
modify the object. XPCOM has no way to check for or enforce this.</blockquote>

<li><b>Marking a parameter <code>const</code></b><blockquote>This is not
directly expressable in xpidl. The xpidl compiler may well mark
pointer/reference type <code>in</code> params as const in the generated
headers.</blockquote>

 <li><b>Use of C arrays</b><blockquote>Currently we have no way to
represent arrays in xpidl or map them to XPConnect. This needs to
be addressed as some point. It is recommended that XPCOM wrapper
interfaces be declared and implemented to manipulate them in the
mean time.</blockquote>

<li><b>Use of C structs and non-XPCOM classes (and
<code>void*</code>)</b><blockquote>Currently we have no way to represent structs
or non-XPCOM classes in xpidl or map them to XPConnect. This needs to be
addressed as some point. It is recommended that XPCOM wrapper interfaces be
declared and implemented to manipulate them in the mean time. 

<p>

Mike Shaver plans to implement a <code>native</code> modifier in xpidl to at
least let pointers to non-XPCOM types appear in idl and the generated headers.
However, interfaces using these <code>native</code> params will not be
reflectable into XPConnect and we would have no way to build proxies for them in
the future without also declaring the struct layout and details in some future
incarnation of xpidl. </blockquote>

<li><b>Failure to use the shared allocator</b><blockquote>XPCOM has
some serious rules about transfer of ownership of pointer type
objects when used in <code>out</code> and <code>in/out</code>
params. Following these rules is inconvenient, but not following them puts
one on the road to memory leaks and crashes. Given:

<pre>NS_IMETHOD GetName(/*out*/ char** name) = 0;</pre>

By the rules, the implementor of this method should be using the shared
allocator (<code>nsIAllocator</code> in our system) to make a copy of
<code>name</code> to hand to the caller. The caller then takes ownership of the
string and uses the shared allocator to free it when it chooses. Any other
scheme is not generally safe. The obvious (unsafe) implementation of the method
is:

<pre>
NS_IMETHODIMP clazz::GetName(/*out*/ char** name) {
    *name = mName;
    return NS_OK;
}
</pre>

This supposes both that the caller will not use the returned pointer past the
lifetime of the callee object and that the callee is implemented such that it
should retain ownership of the string returned to all callers; i.e. what if the
semantics of the implementation where to have the callee return a string that
was different on each call ("string1" then "string2"...), would we expect the
callee to manage and free all of those strings upon its destruction?

<p>

Passing a pointer type as an <code>out</code> (or <code>in/out</code>) param
without transferring ownership implies a contract that is <b>not</b> expressed in
the XPCOM interface. This makes it dangerous. However, while it may be that the
contract is understood by the users of the interface, we currently have no way
to communicate that contract to XPConnect. Given that this pattern is so
prevalent and I can't realistically anticipate that the pattern will go
away, I intend to propose an xpidl keyword to be used to annotate such params so
that XPConnect can know which ones do <b>not</b> follow the standard transfer of
ownership rules. <i>Brendan suggests the keyword: 'weak'. I'm thinking 'shared'.</i></blockquote>


<li><b>STRINGS</b><blockquote>The entire string issue remains a big mess in my
eyes. We have a number of ways in the code to refer to strings:
<code>char*</code> and <code>nsString</code> in a bunch of variations. We may
well have an <code<nsIString</code> interface coming along too. Strings are the
biggest example of the <b>Failure to use the shared allocator</b> problem
mentioned above. We need to agree on a safe set of string representations that
will be used for communication of this data across XPCOM interfaces. We are
just not there yet.</blockquote>


<li><b>C++ references</b><blockquote>(e.g. <code>char*&</code>) This C++ism is
not representable in xpidl. The XPCOM typelib spec allows for representing this
in the sense that it is implemented in binary as a pointer with the added
guarantee that it can not hold a NULL. Mappings like XPConnect can
impose (and honor) this guarantee as it pertains to <code>in</code>
params, but I can't see that it is fully safe for <code>out</code>
params. This is a really C++ only idiom and I don't think it really
belongs in XPCOM interfaces.</blockquote>

<li><b>Passing 'big' things by value</b><blockquote>C++ allows for passing
structs by value. This is generally a mistake, though some structs really fit in
32 or 64 bit 'slots'. Still this is not 'good' XPCOM interface
behavior.</blockquote>

<li><b>Use of <code>#define</code> for
constants</b><blockquote>Converting these to <code>enum</code>
will allow the xpidl compiler to capture them, reflect them into
the generated headers, and, importantly, reflect them into XPConnect
so that these name/value pairs will be accessible to JavaScript
code using the interface.</blockquote>

<li><b>Global <code>enums</code></b><blockquote>We do not have a way to reflect
top level enums into XPConnect. Making use of the interface declaration as a
namespace will both allow us to reflect them into XPConnect and also reduce
global namespace pollution. I encourage people to do this wherever
possible.</blockquote>

<li><b>Mixing XPCOM interface declarations with other
code</b><blockquote>A lot of header files declare XPCOM interfaces
in the same file where 'other' stuff is declared. As we move to
xpidl it will make more sense to separate these.</blockquote>
