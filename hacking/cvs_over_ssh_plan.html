<h1>Moving to CVS over SSH</h1>

<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>
  ...a more secure source repository for Mozilla.
  In light of recent attacks on other open source projects,
    we think it's time to take steps to harden our repository.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, we want a system where anyone can
    check out the code anonymously (or as anonymously as reasonable) at any time;
    but where commits are authenticated and secure.
  It would be a bonus if checkouts were proof against man-in-the-middle modifications,
    but that seems like a very unlikely attack,
    and it's not something for which we'll sacrifice other important features.
</p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>
<p>
  There are two levels of SSH to which we might aspire.
  The first, very convenient, level is what one might call `half-authenticated'.
  At this level, one connects to a public service on a remote machine through SSH.
  That remote machine allows anyone to connect to that service,
    and requires no credentials to establish such a connection.
  The convenient part of this scheme is that repository users wouldn't need to generate key-pairs,
    sending one to mozilla.org to register on the server,
    and distributing their private key to each machine from which they wish to commit to the repository.
</p>
<p>
  The second level is fully authenticated.
  The client `knows' the server, and the server `knows' the client.
  Only clients known to the server may connect over SSH.
  This level is more secure and less convenient.
  To commit evil code to the repository, an attacker must acquire both
    a CVS account/password <strong>and</strong>
    the private half of an SSH key registered on the server (and probably the password to unlock that).
  I can imagine a case where the attack is even more difficult because the CVS account/password must match the SSH user;
    though I'm certain this is not the default setup.
</p>
<p>
  This second level has a higher administrative overhead on both sides of the table.
  Some person or process at mozilla.org has to register keys with the server.
  Each person who wants commit access must generate a key pair and somehow submit the public key to mozilla.org.
</p>
<p>
  The first approach may be considered no more secure than our current scheme by some
    (though it would mean CVS passwords no longer fly about in the clear).
  The second may be considered too annoying.
  Therefor, the jury is still out on which approach we will end up using.
  Here are the steps we are taking:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We need a web-based tool for key submission, that is, if we play to try the fully authenticated approach.
    At this moment, Leaf is modifying our Despot tool to do this, at least for people who currently have commit access.
  </li>
  <li>
    We need a web page describing the plan, the policy, and the mechanics of the switch.
    It needs to point to the key submission tool, if that's the way we go, and when such a tool is available.
    It needs to contain or at least point to documentation about how to actually use CVS over SSH.
    This is the start of such a page.
  </li>
  <li>
    We need to point to that web page from (some subset of)
      the top of tinderbox,
      commiters mail,
      the front page of bugzilla,
      the front page of mozilla.org,
      the hacking page,
      and add a pointer in bugmail and hookmail.
  </li>
  <li>
    We have a tentative deadline for the switch.
    We will mail this deadline to the list of current committers,
      but otherwise avoid publicly tantalizing black-hats.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>In the Interim...</h2>
<p>
  A couple people are already on the fully-authenticated plan.
  We can, with some effort, add people one-by-one if: they already have commit access; and they send us an SSH public key.
</p>

<h2>Questions and Feedback</h2>
<p>
...should be sent to
  <a href="mailto:scc@mozilla.org">Scott Collins</a>, <a href="mailto:leaf@mozilla.org">Leaf</a>,
  and/or <a href="mailto:staff@mozilla.org">mozilla.org staff</a>
