<h1>Mozilla Modules and Module Ownership</h1>

<h2>Distributed Decision-Making</h2>

<p>Mozilla.org staff members do not make many of the ongoing decisions regarding 
  code appropriateness, quality or readiness to be checked into the CVS source 
  repository. The Mozilla project is far too big for staff to do this. The project 
  includes both a set of core technologies (layout engine, networking libraries, 
  cross-platform component model, etc.) and a set of applications built with those 
  technologies (browser, mail/news reader, Internet Relay Chat client). Mozilla.org 
  staff is not equipped to make the volume of decisions needed for ongoing development. 
  For one thing, it would be presumptuous to believe that the Mozilla hackers 
  on mozilla.org staff are the experts in all areas of the code; this is most 
  certainly not the case. For another, staff is small. The project would slow 
  to a crawl if mozilla.org staff tried to make the majority of decisions regarding 
  particular pieces of code.</p>

<p>Instead, mozilla.org distributes decision-making to a range of participants 
  through its "modules" and module ownership. A module is a set of 
  files that implement a piece of functionality that has reasonably defined boundaries. 
  A module may be the set of files in a directory, such as "accessible" 
  for Accessibility. Or a module may be more conceptual, such as "Stylesheets". 
  In such a case the module would include a number of files in different areas 
  of the source tree. A module could contain just two files (if written in C 
  or C++): a .h file and a .c or .cpp file. (An example is xpcom/ds/pldhash.[ch] 
  which is treated separately from other elements of xpcom.)</p>

<p>Of course, "reasonably defined boundaries" doesn't provide absolute 
  clarity. We use this definition because it reflects the code itself, where 
  there may be overlap and ambiguity as to where a particular functionality ends 
  and a different one begins. Trying to create absolute definitions would require 
  elaborate rules and exceptions which aren't needed in most cases. Rather 
  than spend energy devising such definitions, we prefer to let module owners 
  manage any overlap or shared ownership if possible, with mediation by mozilla.org 
  staff if necessary.</p>

<h2>The Module Owner Role</h2>

<p>A "module owner" is someone to whom mozilla.org staff delegates leadership 
  of the module's development. This includes a range of responsibilities, 
  such as: improving code quality, implementing revisions and innovations as 
  appropriate, coordinating development with that of the rest of the codebase, 
  developing and maintaining a shared understanding of where the module is headed, 
  developing APIs where appropriate, documenting as much as possible, responding 
  appropriately to code contributions, design suggestions and stated needs of 
  the community; and creating an environment where competent newcomers are welcomed 
  and included.</p>

<p>A module owner's OK is required to check code into that module. In exchange, 
  we expect that the module owner care about what goes in, respond to patches 
  submitted by others, and be able to appreciate code developed by other people. 
  Module owners have a fair amount of flexibility in how they do this. Mozilla.org 
  staff does not have an elaborate set of rules or procedures for how module owners 
  manage their modules. If it works and the community is generally happy, great. 
  If it doesn't, let's fix it and learn.</p>

<p>Module Owners need not do all the work of managing the module themselves. 
  Module owners may identify others who can also approve code for check-in into 
  a module. These developers are known as "peers" and ought to possess 
  many of the qualities of a good module owner. Module owners <strong><em>must</em></strong> 
  designate to a peer the evaluation of their own code; module owners are not 
  permitted to review their own code. If there is no module owner, the OK of 
  a peer is sufficient to check code into that module.</p>

<p>Module owners are not tyrants. They are chartered to make decisions with input 
  from the community and in the best interests of the community. Module owners 
  are not required to write code because the community wants them to. (Like anyone 
  else, the module owners may write code because they want to, because their employers 
  want them to, because the community wants them to, or for some other reason.) 
  Module owners do need to pay attention to patches submitted to that module. 
  However "pay attention" does not mean agree to every patch. Some 
  patches may not make sense for Mozilla; some may be poorly implemented. Module 
  owners have the authority to decline a patch; this is a necessary part of the 
  role. Mozilla.org asks the module owners to describe in the relevant bug their 
  reasons for wanting changes to a patch, for declining it altogether, or for 
  postponing review for some period. We don't ask or expect them to rewrite 
  patches to make them acceptable. Similarly, module owners may need to delay 
  review of a promising patch due to an upcoming deadline. For example, a patch 
  may be of interest, but not for the next milestone. In such a case it may make 
  sense for the module owner to postpone review of a patch until after matters 
  needed for a milestone have been finalized. Again, we expect this to be described 
  in the relevant bug. And of course, it can't go on very often or for very 
  long without some review by mozilla.org staff.</p>

<h2>Mozilla.org Staff Review</h2>

<p>Mozilla.org will get involved if controversy develops and cannot be resolved 
  otherwise. Sometimes a module owner asks mozilla.org for a public statement 
  of agreement with a particular action. Sometimes other contributors suggest 
  ways in which a module owner might improve. Sometimes there is ongoing controversy. 
  We prefer that the community resolve these issues when possible, but acknowledge 
  that this can't happen all the time. We try to avoid making absolute decisions 
  like "this must happen" but will do so if required.</p>

<h2>Criteria for Module Ownership</h2>

<p>There are a number of elements which are important for good module ownership. 
  First of course, is the person's expertise with the code in question. 
  But over time we've learned that a set of additional criteria is also important, 
  and that a great hacker can be a poor module owner. The criteria that go into 
  the mix for a good module owner include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>expertise with the code in the module</li>
  <li>current level of involvement with the module</li>
  <li>understanding/vision of where the module ought be headed</li>
  <li>appropriate understanding of Mozilla codebase as a whole and 
    the module's relationship to it</li>
  <li>ability to evaluate code for that module, including contributions 
    of patches and new features</li>
  <li>ability to evaluate impact of code on other parts of the codebase</li>
  <li>ability to communicate with a diverse, geographically distributed community</li>
  <li>willingness to evaluate contributions on their merits, regardless 
    of their source (i.e., no 'not invented here' syndrome) </li>
  <li>ability to consider varying perspectives and needs of different consumers 
    of that module</li>
  <li>ability to resolve different needs through factoring or other 
    abstraction techniques when appropriate.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Designating a Module Owner</h2>

<p>We prefer that an individual work with a module for some time and demonstrate 
  his or her ability to fulfill most of the criteria most of the time (we're 
  not naive enough to require perfection), and that a consensus form about designating 
  this person as the module owner. This way the designation is more of a confirmation  
  than an appointment. We haven't always done this, and we haven't 
  always done it well. But we intend to do a better job from now on.</p>
<p>This means that there will be times when there is no module owner. Especially 
  in cases of modules that have received little attention, have started to rot, 
  and some brave soul steps up to figure things out and get us back on track. 
  We'll shower these folks with thanks for tackling the job, and we can do 
  this immediately. We may not immediately designate these people as module owners. 
  Almost by definition, it will be difficult for this person to have demonstrated 
  some of the criteria, particularly 1-5 until s/he has spent some time working 
  with the module. It's possible that someone's expertise is so broad 
  and so deep that s/he could do this, but we would expect this to be the exception 
  rather than the rule.</p>
<p>In determining a module owner, the criteria above are not necessarily accorded 
  the same weight for each module. The importance of a particular element depends 
  on the module. For example, criteria 4 (appropriate understanding of Mozilla 
  codebase as a whole and the module's relationship to it) and 6 (ability 
  to evaluate impact of code on other parts of the codebase) will be of less importance 
  for modules that are self-contained, and of great importance for modules containing 
  core technologies which affect other parts of the code significantly. Similarly, 
  criteria 9 (ability to consider varying perspectives and needs of different 
  consumers of that module) and 10 (ability to resolve different needs through 
  factoring or other abstraction techniques when appropriate) will be less important 
  to a module which serves a specific, clearly defined function for a small number 
  of contributors, and critical to a module which supports a variety of uses and 
  a broad contributor group.</p>

<h2>Tracking Module Owner and Peer Data through Despot</h2>

<p>Mozilla.org uses a database known as "Despot" (despot.mozilla.org) 
  to track modules, module owners and peers. The data can be viewed at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/owners.html">www.mozilla.org/owners.html</a>. 
  This page also contains an indication of what code makes up each module.</p>

<h2>Transfer of Module Ownership</h2>

<p>Module ownership is transferred through mozilla.org. A module owner should 
  resign by sending mail to <a href="mailto:staff@mozilla.org">staff@mozilla.org</a>. 
  The module owner should feel free to include recommendations for a new module 
  owner. In some cases, the module will have a peer who has demonstrated the 
  criteria for module ownership, is interested in being the module owner, and 
  is generally accepted as being a logical successor. In such cases, mozilla.org 
  staff will commit the change of ownership to Despot. In other cases there 
  may not be anyone who has demonstrated the ownership criteria with respect to 
  that module. In these cases, the module may go without an owner until an 
  owner develops, with the peers of the module providing the review and OK necessary 
  to check into that module.</p>

<h2>Relationship to Bugzilla Component Owners</h2>

<p>Occasionally there is some confusion between the role of module owner/peer 
  and that of default owner of a Bugzilla component. The roles are quite different. 
  A component owner is the person best suited to receive incoming bug reports 
  for a particular component; not necessarily the person best suited to make decisions 
  about the direction of the module and the review of its code. There are several 
  reasons for this. First, Bugzilla components do not map exactly to modules. 
  That's because components reflect the way bugs are perceived and experienced, 
  not necessarily the structure of the code. Second, managing bugs is a different 
  task than managing the code of a module. The skills required are different. 
  Some great hackers are not so good at reviewing bug reports regularly, tracking 
  progress, reassigning bugs to correct owners, making sure test cases exist, 
  etc. Some contributors are excellent at these skills but not ready to be module 
  owners. So in some cases the Bugzilla component owner and the module owner may 
  be the same person. But in many cases they will be different.</p>

<h2>Poorly Maintained Modules</h2>

<p>Periodically a module is not well maintained and no longer interacts well with 
  the rest of the codebase. This can happen where there is no module owner, or 
  when a designated module owner is too busy with other things to tend to the 
  module. Conceivably it could happen when a module owner is active, but has 
  an approach to a module that the community in general believes is inappropriate. 
  Mozilla.org staff prefers that the development community identify such modules, 
  propose a solution, and implement improvement. If this can't happen for some 
  reason mozilla.org staff will get involved to find the best possible resolution.</p>
