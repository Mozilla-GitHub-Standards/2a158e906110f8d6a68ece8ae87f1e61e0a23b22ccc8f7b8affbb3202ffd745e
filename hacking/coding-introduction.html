<h2><a name="whatis"></a>What is Mozilla?</h2>

<p>
Mozilla is an open source project and organization to develop a cross-platform
Internet client software. Since it is open source, the source code is available
to everyone - although you have to follow the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">licenses</a>
as defined in the respective source files (a mixture of MPL, NPL, GPL, LGPL).
</p>

<p>
mozilla.org is the name of an organization that provides an infrastructure to
help developers in the project.
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">mozilla.org</a>
is also the address of the central web site for the Mozilla project.
</p>

<h2><a name="motivation"></a>Motivation</h2>

<p>
Mozilla is one of the largest open source software projects. The Mozilla
codebase has millions of lines of code. Therefore, getting started in this huge
project isn't easy. The intention of this document is to give an overview
about what you should be aware of in order to hack Mozilla. It tries to build a
bridge between the many different technologies used in the Mozilla project.
</p>

<p>
When I started to look into Mozilla, I wished a document like this existed. :)
</p>

<h2><a name="audience"></a>Audience</h2>

<p>
This document is primarily written for developers who want to be able to work on
any part of Mozilla. You should have a good understanding of Object Oriented
Programming, and especially you should be experienced with C/C++, as it is the
main programming language used in the project.
</p>

<p>
However, if you intend to work only on a subset of the code, say only the
JavaScript and XUL UI code, this document should still be helpful.
</p>

<h2><a name="scope"></a>Scope of this document</h2>

<p>
This document will try to answer the following questions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>How is the source code organized?</li>
<li>Which technologies are used?</li>
<li>Where do I start?</li>
<li>How do the components work together?</li>
<li>Which tools exist and how can they help me?</li>
<li>What rules do I need to follow in order to contribute?</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="netscape"></a>What does Netscape have to do with this?</h2>

<p>
From my personal point of view, in the beginning of Mozilla there was Netscape.
At some point Netscape, the company, decided to give away those portions of the
source code that they owned and that were free of others' copyright.
</p>

<p>
This wasn't the complete product, therefore the Mozilla project has had to
write a lot of new code. In addition, many portions were rewritten. Some other
components were kept and extended. That's one reason why, in this document
and when discussing the Mozilla project, you will hear the term Netscape.
</p>

<h2><a name="cppjs"></a>C++ and JavaScript</h2>

<p>
As it is widely used in Mozilla, it makes sense to explain how JavaScript and
C++ relate to each other in the Mozilla source code. C++ is a compiled language,
while JavaScript is an interpreted language. JavaScript is most commonly known
as a technology used to implement web sites. However, the developers of Mozilla
decided that the Mozilla source code itself should consist of a mixture of both
languages.
</p>

<p>
When you start the application, the C/C++ components start first. But in an
early stage, a technology called XPConnect gets initialized that enables the use
of interpreted JavaScript at runtime. In fact, a Mozilla browser distribution
consists of both compiled C++ and uncompiled JS files.
</p>

<p>
Note that JavaScript can not be compiled to be executed by the operating system
directly, we still use C/C++ for the back-end of the program, JavaScript runs
inside Mozilla.
</p>

<p>
Also note, when surfing web pages which use JavaScript, that JavaScript code is
executed within a sand box, and does not have access to Mozilla's internal
objects. Only those objects that are exposed by DOM (Document Object Model) are
accessible.
</p>

<p>
Whenever JS is mentioned in this document, it is meant as a technology to
contribute to internal Mozilla functionality. JavaScript is mostly used in those
areas of the source code that care for user interface events. Most of the
following document will explain the C++ aspect of the application.
</p>

<h2><a name="nspr"></a>NSPR - Netscape portable runtime</h2>

<p>
A primary requirement for Software developed in the Mozilla project is that it
must be cross-platform, i.e. it must not be restricted to any particular
operating system.
</p>

<p>
While C++ is intended to be a portable programming language, this portability
aspect applies only to general program logic and data structures. If you want to
write software for a particular operating system, you need to use functionality
that is specific to that system. Often, you want the same functionality on all
systems, but in order to do it, you have to write specific software for each
platform.
</p>

<p>
The intention of
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr/">NSPR</a>
is to provide a layer between the OS and the Mozilla source code, to allow for
simpler coding in other areas of the Mozilla source code. When you are tempted
to use a C library function, you should check first whether NSPR offers a
cross-platform implementation.
</p>

<h2><a name="threads"></a>Threads</h2>

<p>
Mozilla is a multithreaded application. You should understand what that means
before you try to code Mozilla.
</p>

<p>
NSPR provides an operating system independent facility to program with multiple
threads. For example, all network data transfer happens on a separate thread, to
make sure the user interface stays responsive while data is being transferred.
</p>

<p>
One requirement for C++ code you write is that it is safe for multiple threads.
</p>

<h2><a name="oop"></a>Object oriented programming &amp; Modularity</h2>

<p>
Mozilla C++ source code is intended to follow the rules of OOP, that includes
building modular components, where access to internal data (variables) is only
allowed/possible using the public interfaces of your classes.
</p>

<p>
In most simple C++ projects, this only means, you carefully design your classes
to use public/protected/private as appropriate, but all source code is still
available everywhere. For instance, at any time, you can change any class'
component from private to public, so it will be available at any other place in
your project. This does not apply to Mozilla. It was decided that Mozilla should
be even more modular.
</p>

<p>
The Mozilla source code is organized as separate components. While within one
component, you have all the freedom as described in the previous paragraph for
simple projects, you don't have the same level of flexibility between
components.
</p>

<p>
When components talk to each other, they only do so using well defined
interfaces using the component object model (COM).
</p>

<h2><a name="interfaces"></a>Interfaces</h2>

<p>
The concept of interfaces is something that is used in the CORBA technology, for
example. Both CORBA and Mozilla use a similar language to describe interfaces,
which is XPIDL (IDL means Interface Definition Language).
</p>

<p>
In a CORBA environment, life is more restrictive and difficult, because you have
inter-process and inter-network communication, something which Mozilla is not
actively using. In a distributed CORBA environment, it is difficult to change
the components of an interface, because you are usually unable to replace all
running systems at the same time. If you want to change something, you have to
define a new version of an interface, but you might still be required to support
the old one.
</p>

<p>
As Mozilla is not a distributed application as of writing, it is currently
possible to change most interfaces as the development process requires it. But
because the Mozilla browser runs embedded in some environments, those
environments must be able to rely on a fixed interface, therefore interfaces can
be frozen. This state is usually indicated in the interface definition. As
Mozilla stabilizes over time, or approaches the magical version number
One-Dot-Zero, the ratio of frozen to not frozen interfaces is likely to
increase.
</p>

<p>
One step of building Mozilla is automatically translating the interface
definition files into C/C++ header files. That's the job of Mozilla's
own IDL compiler, xpidl.
</p>

<p>
Besides of the methods and data members, interfaces have additional attributes.
They have a UUID, a number to uniquely identify an interface. Interfaces can
have the scriptable attribute, which means they will be accessible from the
JavaScript code. A scriptable interface is restricted to only use data types for
parameters that are valid within the JavaScript runtime.
</p>

<h2><a name="xpcom"></a>XPCOM / nsISupports / nsCOMPtr</h2>

<p>
XPCOM is Mozilla's own implementation of COM - the component object model.
The XP in front means it is cross-platform (do not confuse this with XP as it
appears in product names for a certain operating system manufacturer). The fact
that it is cross-platform makes XPCOM more versatile than any other form of COM.
</p>

<p>
You should definitively read the introductory documents on
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xpcom/">XPCOM</a>
on mozilla.org. To get you started, one could say that XPCOM is the engine that
makes the COM concept work. This includes playing the role of an object broker.
</p>

<p>
Typically, an interface describes an object that can be used to get a job done.
If you have a job to do, you need to request an implementation that provides the
interface. That implementation can reside within another component. To decide
which particular implementation you want, you are using a contract ID, which is
a text based identifier. The contract ID is a contract on the behaviour of the
implementation, accessible using the well defined interface. The XPCOM runtime
system knows which class implements which contract ID, and which component
provides it.
</p>

<p>
Even if your code stays completely within one component, and therefore using COM
is not a strict requirement, it is used very often anyway. One reason is
flexibility. Another one is to allow sharing functionality with those portions
of the Mozilla logic that are implemented using JavaScript. Mozilla provides a
technology called XPConnect that enables communication between interpreted
JavaScript and compiled C++ at runtime.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you request an instance of a COM object at runtime, a class object will
be created and you will be given an interface pointer. For several reasons it
was decided that these instances are reference counted. One reason is
efficiency, for it making unnecessary copies of objects should be avoided.
Another requirement is that data objects must be passed between threads, but all
keep a pointer to the same data object in memory. Finally, the same data object
might be referenced by multiple components, or stored in multiple lists.
</p>

<p>
As the lifetime of a reference is different, it is easiest to have each object
maintain a reference count, to remember how often it is currently referenced by
something else. When you are given a reference to an object (be it from the
XPCOM engine directly or from a function call), you have to make sure that you
care for reference counting. You must tell the object whether you want to keep a
reference to it, or whether you are finished with it, and remove the reference.
That way, the object can decide on its own whether it is still needed. When its
not needed anymore, it deletes itself from memory.
</p>

<p>
In order to implement this generic functionality, all classes in Mozilla that
implement any interface share the common base class nsISupports, which
implements the reference counter and automatic destruction functionality. A
similar base class exists in every implementation of COM.
</p>

<p>
There is the general rule, that you must clean up what you allocate. For
instance, if you add a reference, you are strongly encouraged to release the
reference as soon as it is no longer needed. If you don't, you might cause
problems such as memory leaks.
</p>

<p>
In C++, this can be done by explicit method calls to methods of the nsISupports
base class. But calling these methods is not only easy to forget, but it also
makes your code less readable. Especially since many functions/methods have
multiple exit points (i.e. return statements).
</p>

<p>
You have to make sure that you release all your referenced objects in each of
your exit points. To make this easier, and to not have to repeat many release
calls, a general helper class has been provided for dealing with pointers to COM
objects, whose name is
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xpcom/nsCOMPtr.html">nsCOMPtr</a>.
This is something special to XPCOM and makes coding COM much easier. It
simulates a pointer through overriding certain operators. Although there might
be some edge cases, the following general rule should be followed for nearly all
code: Whenever you'd expect to use a pointer variable
"interface*" to an object that implements an interface, use a local
"nsCOMPtr&lt;interface&gt;" variable instead. As soon as this pointer
goes "out of scope", its destructor will automatically decrease the
reference count, triggering destruction if possible.
</p>

<p>
In interpreted JavaScript this is easier to code, because of garbage collection.
There is some magic that automatically releases the references when possible.
However, this magic requires that you don't introduce cycles. For example,
if you have two objects, and each contain a reference to each other, but nobody
else keeps a reference to them, this can not be detected, and those objects will
live in memory for the rest of program execution.
</p>

<h2><a name="exceptions"></a>Exceptions / nsresult</h2>

<p>
Code execution can fail at runtime. One programming mechanism to deal with
failure is to use exceptions. While Mozilla uses Exceptions in its JavaScript
code portions, it does not in C++. One out of several reasons for this is
exceptions haven't always been portable, so what was done in the past has
stuck. Mozilla C++ code uses return codes to simulate exceptions. That means,
while in JavaScript you can use try-catch blocks, in C++ you should check the
return code whenever you call an interface method. That return code is of type
nsresult. For this reason, the logical return type, as defined in the IDL file,
is mapped to an additional method parameter in the C++ code.
</p>

<p>
The nsresult type is intended to transport additional failure reasons. Instead
of simply reporting failure or success, an integer type is used instead, to
allow for defining a lot of different error codes.
</p>

<p>
There are some general result codes, like NS_OK, which is used to indicate that
everything went well and program flow can continue, or NS_ERROR_FAILURE, which
is used if something went wrong, but no more details need to be provided as of
yet.
</p>

<p>
In addition to that, each component can request its own range of integers to
define error codes that will not overlap with those failure codes used in other
areas of an application. Look at mozilla/xpcom/base/nsError.h for more
information.
</p>

<h2><a name="strings"></a>Strings in C++</h2>

<p>
While many application frameworks or class libraries decided to use just a
single string class, the Mozilla developers have decided they need something
more powerful. They have implemented a hierarchy of several string classes,
which allows the dynamic runtime behaviour to be optimized for different
situations. Sometimes you just need to fixed size string, sometimes you need a
large string that grows over time. Therefore, for example, not only flat
strings, but also segmented string types are available.
</p>

<p>
An additional requirement is that Mozilla has to be fully multi-language. All
strings that deal with information shown to a user are therefore using
multi-byte Unicode character strings.
</p>

<p>
The string types are template based, with the character type as the variable
type, to allow the same logic to be used with regular and Unicode strings.
</p>

<p>
While that approach of having many string classes means a lot of flexibility,
the drawback is that learning Mozilla's string classes is not trivial.
</p>

<h2><a name="gui"></a>Graphical User Interface / XUL</h2>

<p>
Most operating systems define their own way to develop graphical user
interfaces, and they are mostly different.
</p>

<p>
For a cross-platform application like Mozilla it is crucial to have a set of
technologies that hide the operating system dependent logic from the application
logic.
</p>

<p>
In the past a lot of C/C++ libraries have been coded that were cross-platform.
To my knowledge, none of them are used in Mozilla, yet we have created our own
graphics system.
</p>

<p>
When defining the layout of a GUI (graphical user interface), you can choose to
go with either of two possibilities. You could define the absolute positions of
each UI (user interface) element that you want to appear. This approach actually
has been chosen by a lot of GUI libraries. But it has some drawbacks - you are
not very flexible when the layout changes when adding more elements, because you
have to rearrange all elements to new positions. You also have to do that
graphically, to get immediate feedback which elements overlap, etc. But still,
the UI might not look as intended when a different font with different metrics
has to be used - this can make a UI unusable.
</p>

<p>
Mozilla developers wanted to have something very flexible. As Mozilla is
cross-platform, it has to be very flexible with regards to fonts.
</p>

<p>
Mozilla developers have chosen to use an approach where the contents of the UI
are designed in a logical matter. We don't currently use an UI editor. We
write a file with instructions how the UI should look. At runtime, the layout
engine decides which fonts are available, and considers all the requests that
have been defined in the UI description, and creates the actual UI dynamically.
This is similar to what the web browser does when displaying web pages.
</p>

<p>
The web has gone from a mostly text-based system to a very graphical rich
environment that has user interfaces akin to many programs. Therefore, it was
only natural for a web browser to use web languages in order to define its user
interface. It was decided to use an XML based syntax to write the UI
description, which has been called XUL (extensible user-interface language). (A
good reference for XUL is available at
<a href="http://www.xulplanet.com/">XULPlanet</a>).
</p>

<p>
A XUL file describes what elements the UI consists of, and where elements
appear. The XUL language defines attributes that allow the programmer to define
the actions controls react to. To define the dynamic behaviour of the
application, one can define JavaScript functions that will be called when
certain user interface events happen. Within those JavaScript functions, you can
either do the required application behaviour directly, or call any other
application logic available by COM objects, including logic defined in C++.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the logical representation of the UI, people also prefer to have
a pretty looking UI. To define the detailed characteristics of the UI, one uses
CSS files, that defines, for example, which images will be used to display
certain UI elements. This makes it flexible to define additional
"looks" for the application, which are referred to as
"themes" or "skins". Mozilla defines currently two themes,
classic and modern, which are actively maintained by the Mozilla developers.
While there exist additional themes for Mozilla, they often exist only for
certain versions of Mozilla. It is a lot of work for a theme designer to stay in
sync with all the changes that happen to the UI each day.
</p>

<h2><a name="build"></a>Build System and Tree</h2>

<p>
Nowadays Mozilla is mostly used as a group of many shared libraries, loaded
dynamically at runtime as needed. The COM system allows for a development
environment, where you often need to re-compile only a subset of the application
when you make changes to areas of the source code base. This is a very
convenient development environment, but it means a slowdown at runtime. On the
other hand, it is possible to create an executable where Mozilla's
internal components are mostly linked statically. Due to the size of the
application, this link step takes a lot of time, and makes most sense when
preparing a package for distribution.
</p>

<p>
Each component contains its own directory in the root directory of Mozilla. It
might also contain subcomponents within it called modules. There are make files
throughout the tree which tell Mozilla how to build.
</p>

<p>
Most of the platform-specific code is contained in only a few places of the
tree. The layer that sits between the operating system and the rest of the
Mozilla code are the interfaces that are implemented by this code. Only the
platform-specific code pertaining to the platform in which the build is
occurring is built.
</p>

<p>
Operating system messages are gathered by the platform-specific code and then
sent to the platform-independent code in the same way.
</p>

<p>
Widgets in respect to the Mozilla project are OS-independent widgets drawn using
platform-specific rendering techniques.
</p>

<p>
Within the tree, directories named public usually contain interface headers, and
directories named src usually contain interface implementations and
non-interface headers.
</p>

<p>
Building this program can be daunting for someone not used to a project this
large. It can take from 20 minutes on a powerful workstation to a couple hours
on an older PC. First, you have to get the source, then build it using the rules
contained in
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/">http://www.mozilla.org/build/</a>.
While it's building, it will move all the header files to the dist/include
directory so that you don't have to specify the directory of each header.
It will also copy all the XUL, graphics, and JavaScript files (collectively
called the chrome) to the chrome directory (a child of the directory containing
the Mozilla binary). They are mapped to chrome:// URLs as defined in a file
called jar.mn. In release versions of Mozilla, the chrome directory will only
contain .jar files.
</p>

<p>
Building Mozilla is only part of the process. If you want to develop, you will
have to maintain the tree using a program called
<a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a>.
When the build fails, you have to solve conflicts that occur when a merge
between a file in your tree and one in the repository fails. Also, when you
hack the tree, you have to build parts of the trees you modified. Occasionally,
you will have to rebuild the entire tree using a process called depending, so
that dependencies between source files can be determined. Also, you will
occasionally have to rebuild the tree. Most likely, while you are doing this,
you will be maintaining your own changes to the tree and trying to keep it in
sync with others' changes.
</p>

<h2><a name="startup"></a>Application Startup</h2>

<p>
Mozilla's COM system relies on type libraries and an internal registry of
available components and interfaces. During application startup, a check is
being made whether the registry is still up to date. If changed libraries are
detected, the registry is updated. Each component is allowed to do
initialization during that registration phase. If changed libraries are
detected, they are loaded and their initialization logic is executed. Besides
changed libraries, only those application components are loaded as they become
required.
</p>

<h2><a name="notification"></a>Internal Notification System</h2>

<p>
This section describes an engine that is available inside Mozilla. Most of the
time you don't need it, but if you are required to react to certain events,
knowing this system might be helpful. The idea of OOP is, you only do your own
job. However, it often happens that component A needs to react when another
component triggers an action in B. But component B should not know the details
of what needed to happen, because its better to keep parts of the code separate.
What is required here is: If other components need to react to B's actions,
B should be extended to send out notifications when its actions are triggered.
In addition, B keeps a dynamic list at runtime, where it remembers who wants to
be notified. At runtime, when A becomes initialized, A informs B that it wants
to become a member of the notification list.
</p>

<p>
To make this more generic, it has been decided to use a central observer
service. When component B triggers an action, it just notifies the observer
service, specifying a descriptive name of the event. Components like A subscribe
to the observer service giving the names of events they would like to observe.
Using that principle, only the observer service has to deal with lists of
components watching for events. When the observer receives notification for an
event, it passes that notification on to all listening components for that
event. Look at nsIObserver for more information.

<h2><a name="localization"></a>Localization</h2>

<p>
Mozilla was designed to separate code from human language. Whenever you need to
use a text string that needs to be shown to a user, you are not allowed to store
that string directly in your JavaScript or C++ file. Instead you define an
descriptive identifier for your text, which is used in your C++ or JavaScript
file. You use that identifier as a key and call members of the string bundle
interface to retrieve the actual text. The text itself is stored in separate
files, that only contain text. As Mozilla is modular, there are a lot of those
files, each owned by a separate module. With that separation, it is easy to have
translators create different language versions of those text files.
</p>

<p>
When defining the UI, there are two kinds of strings. Some strings are known at
the time the application is compiled and packaged, like labels for input fields,
or the text that appears within the help system. Other text is assembled
dynamically at runtime.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you define text that does not need to be accessed at runtime, you
define it in DTD files. You can refer to that text directly in XUL files.
</p>

<p>
If you need to work with text at runtime, for example if your text contains a
placeholder for a user name that needs to be filled at runtime, you define your
text in properties files.
</p>

<h2><a name="review"></a>Coding and Review Rules</h2>

<p>
You are free to download Mozilla, change the code, and work with a version that
contains your own changes.
</p>

<p>
However, one idea behind open source as used in Mozilla is the following: You
received the source for free, and if you make changes, you should consider
giving something back to the community. By doing so, you become a contributor.
</p>

<p>
But the Mozilla community has decided that it can't accept just any change
to be integrated into the public central Mozilla codebase. If you want your code
to become a part of it, you need to follow rules. These rules are not like law,
but basically you must convince people that your change is good.
</p>

<p>
The idea is, a lot of effort has been made to get the Mozilla code to its
current state. While the Mozilla code is, like every piece of software, far from
being perfect, people try to avoid anything that decreases maintainability, and
to only allow code that seems to be correct.
</p>

<p>
In order to achieve this, the Mozilla community has decided that all code has to
be reviewed by other already known Mozilla hackers. There are two levels of
review. You should get a first review (r=) from the owner of the code area your
are changing. You are expected to make the corrections that are requested, or
your code will not go in. If you have that first review, you need to get what is
called super-review (sr=) in most cases. There are only a limited number of
"Mozilla gurus" that have an accepted reputation for making good
decisions on what code is good and what needs to be changed. Once you have both
reviews, your code may be checked in most of the time. There are other levels of
review in certain instances, and that is described elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Many people make changes to Mozilla. While everybody tries to make Mozilla
better, every change has the risk of unforeseen side effects. This range from
application features that, as a result of a change, no longer work, to the
simple problem, that Mozilla source code does not even compile anymore. The
latter is called "the tree is broken, burning, or red", where tree
refers to the CVS source repository.
</p>

<p>
If you are developing only on one combination of operating system and compiler,
and you are not paying attention to the portability rules (read the documents on
mozilla.org), it is very easy to break the tree. You should try your best to not
break it, and getting review hopefully will find potential problems early,
before the changes are checked in.
</p>

<p>
A broken tree sucks. The Mozilla community has decided on the rule, that no
other check-ins are allowed while the tree is broken. This is to help people who
try to fix the problem. Allowing additional changes would make it even more
difficult to find the real cause of a problem, because any new check-in could
contain new problems.
</p>

<h2><a name="milestones"></a>Milestones</h2>

<p>
Every several weeks mozilla.org produces a new snapshot of the source
repository. The idea is, people in the world should try out the current
snapshot, and report any problems (bugs) they find. However, mozilla.org wants
to emphasize that these milestones are being produced for testing purposes only.
</p>

<p>
In order to prepare a more stable milestone, the rules for making changes to the
source code repository get more restrictive prior to producing a new milestone.
mozilla.org defines a schedule, and a couple of days before a milestone date,
only those check-ins are allowed that have been approved by the mozilla.org
"drivers". Drivers are a bunch of people who have the highest
authority regarding the Mozilla repository. The drivers will also decide whether
the milestone seems ready, or whether the schedule will be delayed in order to
allow more fixes to be produced, that will make it more stable.
</p>

<h2><a name="bugzilla"></a>Bugzilla</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>
is mozilla.org's web based bug tracking system. Whenever a problem is
encountered, people are asked to file a new bug (sometimes also known as problem
ticket), with a good description of what happened. You will then be issued a bug
or ticket number. This number will be used when people talk about the problem.
Developers will subscribe to the "bug" and add comments to it, and if
they know a fix, they will attach a patch to show how they suggest to fix the
problem. Reviews will also be tracked within this system.
</p>

<p>
The term "bug" is most often referred to as a software error. However,
within Bugzilla, a bug can be anything that needs to be tracked. This ranges
from software errors to enhancement requests. For example, the evolution of this
document is tracked in
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123230">bug #123230</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you are not a C++ developer, you can also work on Bugzilla. It started out as
a simple bug reporting tool and has turned into quite a functional, complex
system that has many users from other projects (such as
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Redhat</a>).
</p>

<h2><a name="webtools"></a>Webtools / LXR / Bonsai</h2>

<p>
Webtools are server based tools that store information, and allow their
information to be displayed and maybe even manipulated. You access such systems
using a web browser, e.g. Mozilla.
</p>

<p>
Mozilla developers have created several tools in order to make their life
easier. We have already talked about Bugzilla.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/">LXR</a>
is a hypertext search engine for the Mozilla source code. You can look up
identifiers and text, and you will see where in Mozilla it is used. Clicking on
search result entries will directly bring you to current source code. The code
is shown in a web page, and identifiers are hyperlinks, which, when clicked,
will bring you the LXR search result for that identifier. You can use LXR to
browse the source code and quickly navigate through it. It is based of the Linux
project's glimpse engine with internal modifications.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/">Tinderbox</a>
is a tool that shows the current state of the source repository. mozilla.org
hosts several machines for many different operating systems, that repeatedly and
constantly obtain (check out) the newest source code from the central
repository, and try to compile it. When finished with compiling, some automated
tests are executed to check, whether the program still works correctly. The
results of compilation and tests are reported to the central tinderbox system.
When you access the tinderbox page, you can see whether the source code
repository is currently in good condition, and how things changed in the past
few hours. Tinderbox shows a graph, where time is shown vertically and the
different machines / operating systems are displayed horizontally. Each
compilation test phase is represented by a bar, defined by the required time for
building.
</p>

<p>
The bar is filled with a color. Green means good. Yellow means, compilation is
still in progress, orange means compilation and building were successful, but
one of the automated tests failed. Red means, the source code did not even
compile. If the tree is red, it slows down development.
</p>

<p>
Tinderbox is a very helpful tool, and everybody making changes to the source
repository is expected to "watch the tree", i.e. watch whether your
changes cause anything to fail.
</p>

<p>
To assist you more, additional information is available on the tinderbox page.
As people check in, their names appear on the page. There is a link to a list of
changes they have made. If a compilation or test failed, the box will contain
links to the output from the compiler, which should show the reason for failure.
Additional text on the page shows the results of performance measurement.
</p>

<p>
Another web tool is
<a href="http://bonsai.mozilla.org/">Bonsai</a>.
Bonsai tracks all changes made to the source repository. You can retrieve a
listing of all changes made by people. It also provides a powerful interface to
query the list of changes.
</p>

<h2><a name="more"></a>Finding more information</h2>

<p>
If you want to learn more about the mentioned programming techniques in general,
I recommend searching the web for free documents. Hopefully the mentioned terms
in this document will guide you. If you prefer to read books, I suggest to
choose those books, where the author tries to explain in general, and does not
concentrate on some particular operating system.
</p>

<p>
Most documentation regarding to Mozilla development is published on the
www.mozilla.org web site. If you can't find what you are looking for, try
to use a search engine. Some popular search engines offer an advanced search
option, where one can limit the search to a specific web site.
