<h1>Hacking Mozilla</h1>
<p>This is where to find what you need to know in order to get your code checked
in to mozilla's CVS repository. If you've never built Mozilla before, then
you should start by downloading and looking at and building the 
<a href="../source.html">source code</a>. Then check out the
<a href="coding-introduction.html">Mozilla Hacker's Getting 
Started Guide</a>.</p>


<h2>Life Cycle of a Patch</h2>

<p>If you are looking to create a patch, the following guidelines may be useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>
One of our primary design considerations is that our code work on a wide
variety of platforms. There are people porting Mozilla to embedded platforms
using compilers that may not support all the latest standards. If you are writing
compiled code (C, C++), help these platforms by following our 
<a href="portable-cpp.html">C/C++ Portability Guidelines</a> 
and compiling with as many warnings turned on as possible. Maybe one day you'll 
find your code running on a truly unusual platform like your cable box or cell 
phone.</li>

<li>
Make sure that your code is 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/l10n/customizable-code.html">localizable</a>.
There are 62 <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/l10n/mlp_status.html#projects">
registered localization projects</a>, of which seven to ten are currently active.</li>

<li>
Be aware of the <a href="mozilla-style-guide.html">Mozilla Style
Guidelines</a>.</li>

<li>
Take customizability into account. One of the biggest advantages of Mozilla 
technology is customizability. Vendors or distributors of Mozilla might have special 
requirements of tailoring Mozilla towards their needs. To facilitate the distribution of
Mozilla, please take customizability into account so optional features can be added, 
removed, modified easily.</li>

<li>
Read our <a href="../roadmap.html">development roadmap</a>.
This is the architectural overview of where the Mozilla browser is heading,
and good reading for anyone hacking Mozilla.</li>

<li>
When creating a new source file, add 
<a href="../MPL/boilerplate-1.1/">boilerplate</a> license headers as appropriate, and 
fill in the blank fields.
If appropriate, add yourself to the contributors section of the license
header of files you modify.</li>

<li>
Patches should be created against current CVS, preferably with enough context to be 
understood without opening the source file.  A good default guideline is to use 
<b>cvs diff -u8pN</b> at a minimum.  If more context is required to make the patch 
understandable, replace 8 with a higher number.</li>

</ul>

<p>When you have a patch, submit it to 
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a>
as an attachment to that bug. We're big believers
in code review, so before code is checked in to the CVS Repository it must
be reviewed by the appropriate <a href="../owners.html">module owner</a>
or one of his peers. Modules do not quite directly correspond to
Bugzilla Components, but there is a strong correlation. To get review:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask a <a href="../owners.html">module owner or peer for the module in question</a>
explicitly for a review by setting the review flag for the patch to <code>?</code>
(indicating that review is requested) and entering the email address of
the person from whom you are requesting review.</li>
<li>You may also mail the module owner or peer directly, mentioning the bug 
number, the fact that you have a patch attached, and that you would 
like them to review it.  However, requests made using Bugzilla's request
feature are less likely to get lost.</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, you will receive a response within the next few days. 
Unfortunately, some people are too busy to catch up with all their bug news. 
So, if you don't receive a response within a week, and you think the patch 
deserves attention now (instead of, say, in a year or so), you could:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask Bugzilla who else has reviewed patches for bugs in that component, and 
ask them to review it instead</li>
<li>Ask on IRC in <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/#developers">#developers</a> as to 
who a suitable reviewer might be. Note: request review via email, not on IRC</li>
</ul>

<p>The reviewer may well have comments on your patch which you will need
to address. When they are satisfied, they will mark the patch as reviewed,
and maybe say "r=&lt;user&gt;" in the bug.</p>

<p>In most cases an additional level of review known as 
"super-review" is required. The <a href="reviewers.html">super-review</a> 
document details how to go about getting super-review. Again, the super-reviewer
may request changes to your patch, and when they are happy, they will
say so in the bug.</p>

<p>When you have review and super-review, and your patch is as good as it can
be, it can be checked into the tree. If you do not have a CVS account, you
will need to find someone to check it in for you, which is actually really
easy: just add the <code>checkin-needed</code> keyword to the bug. A handful
of committers have searches set up for this and occasionally go through and
commit uncommitted patches, usually within a week or two of your adding the
keyword. If it takes longer than two weeks, it's probably worth jumping on IRC
and asking for someone to commit your patch (and go through the bugs with
<code>checkin-needed</code>, too, since many of them will have been waiting just
as long).</p>

<p>Occasionally, the tree is locked down a little tighter approaching a release,
and a third level, called "approval", is required before you can check in. 
During these times, <a href="http://tinderbox.mozilla.org">Tinderbox</a> 
will have a notice at the top saying that approval is required. To request
approval, set the appropriate approval flag to <code>?</code> by editing
the attachment.
If approval is refused, you may have to wait a week to check in your patch,
until the release is made or development for the release moves onto a
branch.</p>

<p>If you are having any trouble with this process, or need guidance, please
mail <a href="mailto:gerv@mozilla.org">Gerv</a>.</p>

<h2>CVS Commit Access Rules</h2>

<p>When you've been contributing patches frequently and
have an established track record for good quality code, you can start the
process of <a href="getting-cvs-write-access.html">getting
CVS Commit access</a>. The following rules apply to those with CVS Commit access:</p>

<p>The most important rules are those regarding the build process.
Disregarding them wastes a lot of other people's time. Blatant offenders
will be pestered into compliance. Resistance is futile.</p>

<ul>
<li>
Learn to <a href="rules.html">follow the
tree rules</a>. Our build process is flexible, works with a minimum of
human intervention and has scaled to work with hundreds of engineers. This
process works and will continue to work if people follow these simple rules.
</li>

<li>
Everyone checking into the repository must do their part to keep the tree
green. Make sure your code builds on other platforms <b>before</b> it's
checked in. After your checkin, it's your responsibility to make sure tinderbox
builds your code sucessfully, and to be available to help fix unanticipated
build or runtime problems. 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?oi=djq&amp;as_umsgid=mcmullen-2404991952090001%40h-208-12-40-136.mcom.com">Breaking
 the tree wastes time</a> for many people. Don't do it.</li>

<li>
Learn to use <a href="http://tinderbox.mozilla.org">Tinderbox</a>
effectively. Tinderbox can be used to find all sorts of information about
the tree. As someone checking in code to the tree, you must use bonsai
to find out news about the tree, such as whether it's open and whether
there are any planned closures.</li>

<li>
When creating a new directory, get the permission from the owner of the
containing directory. To add a new directory to to the "mozilla" top-level
directory, contact the mozilla.org <a href="mailto:staff@mozilla.org">staff</a>.
We prefer not to add new top level directories unless there is a very good
reason. Most new projects will fit somewhere already in the tree, like components.</li>

</ul>
    
<p>Happy hacking!</p>
