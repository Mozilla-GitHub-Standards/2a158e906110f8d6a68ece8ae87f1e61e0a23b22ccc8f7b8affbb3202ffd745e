<h1>Tips For Contributing New Features To Mozilla</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Learn the codebase and coding practices before you start 
your feature.</p>

<p>Include learning time in your schedule. Mozilla is a complex 
codebase. Our portability requirements may be new to even seasoned 
developers. Our cross-platform component model (&ldquo;XPCOM&rdquo;) 
is similar to COM, but you&rsquo;ll want to make sure you use it 
well before going too far with your project. And of course, we have 
a <a href="./#coding-practices">set of coding practices</a> 
to help everyone live together. Life will be much easier if your 
team has one or more members who are already familiar with and to 
the Mozilla world.</p></li>

<li><p> Develop relationships with existing developers in the area 
of your feature. If you want to add a big new feature to mail, spend 
some time helping the existing mail developers. Talk to the developers 
about fixing some of their bugs. Fix some bugs. Have some of your QA 
team get involved. Once you&rsquo;re familiar with an area, do the 
completely unexpected and write a piece of documentation. Developers 
will be grateful, and you&rsquo;ll be known as someone seriously 
interested in contributing. Become familiar with our 
<a href="reviewers.html">code review processes</a>. Have someone on 
your team become Mozilla-savvy enough to 
<a href="getting-cvs-write-access.html">obtain CVS access</a>.</p></li>

<li><p> Help the existing developers to understand that you are
&ldquo;for real.&rdquo; That you have a clue about Mozilla development; 
that your team is going to ship a product. Our developers get a lot of 
mail, and not all of it is helpful. We appreciate the attention and 
interest in Mozilla, but the developers have to prioritize how they 
spend their time. Help them to realize you&rsquo;re an informed 
developer who is interested and able to contribute. This will be much 
easier if you&rsquo;ve been working on suggestion two.</p></li>

<li><p>Designate someone on your team to be involved with the
mozilla.org CVS repository on a regular basis. The ease of integrating 
your feature will increase if someone on your team is intimately 
involved with the source tree. Reviewing the tree only at the 
milestone releases is risky if you're doing significant development. 
Something may have changed that will cause you extra work. And you'll 
miss the early discussion phase when you can add your perspective to 
the design work. If you absolutely don't have the resources to do this, 
then plan for extra integration time.</p></li>

<li><p>Work hard to have a developer involved in the
core code who is connected to what you are doing. If you
can&rsquo;t make this happen, let mozilla.org staff know and we
will try to facilitate this. It&rsquo;s possible developers
may not pay much attention to you because they believe your
proposed feature is not a high priority, or is not wanted at all,
or that you haven&rsquo;t demonstrated that you understand the
codebase and Mozilla coding practices well enough for them to spend
a lot of time with you. In some cases the developers
may be in error and staff will work to make this clear and get you
connected. In other cases, mozilla.org staff may agree with
the developers that it does not make sense for them to spend much
time assisting with your project. This is a painful setting
and we hope it doesn&rsquo;t happen often. But our
developers are a precious commodity and their time is probably the
most important resource we have.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that a developer is over-worked or on
vacation or just drops the ball. Obviously, we&rsquo;ll
never reach perfection but we need to reduce these occurrences as
much as possible to have a successful project. If this
happens to you, let us know. We&rsquo;ll talk to the
developers in question, find others to help you, and try to improve
your experience with the project. Eventually you&rsquo;ll be
plugged in enough you won&rsquo;t need us, you&rsquo;ll be able to
find your own back-ups. We&rsquo;ll still want to know if a
developer is consistently not responding to contributors, but
you&rsquo;ll be able to deal with the occasional problems just by
asking someone else.</p></li>

<li><p>Design in the open. Post your plans to the
appropriate newsgroup. If there is no response, double-check
to see if you have been successful with suggestion five.</p></li>

<li><p>Try hard to design your feature so that it can be implemented
and reviewed in manageable size patches. If you can
implement and submit core elements first and build on them in
subsequent patches, so much the better. If you think your
feature can only be implemented and reviewed in one enormous
chunk, ask for design help in the appropriate newsgroup and/or from
the developers with whom you have established relationships.</p></li>

<li><p>If it is not possible to submit your feature in
manageable size patches and you submit a 500k patch, be
prepared for several months of review and revision before the patch
is ready to be checked in. It may not take this
long. But if your team has worked for months on a feature, it
is going to take reviewers new to the code a long time to work
their way through it. And if it&rsquo;s not
possible to design the feature in bite-size chunks, it probably
won&rsquo;t be possible to review it that way either. We
expect our reviewers to understand the code they approve for
check-in, not to simply glance at it and say OK. Finding the
focus to digest a massive patch in the midst of multiple other
demands will take time, even if you&rsquo;ve done a perfect
job. And since few of us are perfect, chances are that
revisions will be requested.</p></li>

<li><p>If you&rsquo;ve got a large patch, let the likely
reviewers know when they might expect to see it. If
your timeframe is tight, check out the Mozilla roadmap for
milestone dates and see if your feature will arrive at a time of
furious activity. If so, and if your feature is
not of general interest, prepare to be a low priority for a
while.</p></li>

<li><p>Get connected with mozilla.org staff. <a href=
"mailto:mitchell@mozilla.org">mitchell@mozilla.org</a> is a good
contact for project management discussions. Let us know what
you&rsquo;re doing. If you can find the resources,
designate someone on your team as the liaison to mozilla.org for
project management issues.</p></li>

<li><p>Become familiar with the <a href="code-review-faq.html">Code 
Review FAQ</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Review and super-review take time. Improving the
code as requested by the reviewers takes time. Poor quality
code also takes time. We&rsquo;ve opted to spend the time
improving code consistency before check-in when the pain is limited
to the developers and the reviewers rather than everyone in the
tree. We&rsquo;re committed to this style of
development, but recognize that vigilance is necessary to make sure
newcomers and their features don&rsquo;t get lost. If
you&rsquo;re having a particularly bad experience or if
you&rsquo;ve got suggestions on how to improve our process, please
let mozilla.org staff know.</p></li>
