<!--

     To write pages using this template:

     Set the <title> contents to "marketing.mozilla.org: " followed by
     the page's subject.

     Set the body's class to "promote n1" where "n1" is the number of
     the list item representing the type of promotion, or just the
     empty string if it doesn't apply.

     Change the links in between the headers so that they point to
     each parent page in turn. Use relative links. Put the home page
     at the top of the list, and this page at the bottom. The link for
     this page should be "".

     Set the <h1> element to the page's subject, same as in the
     <title>.

     Write the content of the page using simple HTML.

     Update the virtual="../../foo.inc" links to point (using relative
     links) to the relevant files. This basically means having the
     right number of "../"s depending on the directory. Also update
     the stylesheet link in the same way.

   <h1>Website Advertising</h1>
   <p>Depending on how aggressive you want to be, there are four basic ways of advertising Firebird on your website.  Click on the
      campaign you wish to pursue for further directions:</p>
   <p><center><b>Most Aggressive</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a     href="#roadblock">Roadblock</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#popup">Popup ad</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#buttons">Buttons</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#link">Text Links</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Least Aggressive</b></center></p><br>

   <a name="roadblock"><h2>Roadblock</h2>
   <p>A roadblock is a page that appears when users of other browsers try to access your site.  The page promotes Firebird but allows the user to continue on to your site using their current browser; hence, it acts as a "roadblock" or obstacle.  Setting up a roadblock is easy.  Simply use Javascript to check the user's browser, and redirect them to the promotional page if they aren't using Firebird:
<pre>
if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Firebird") == -1) {
  window.location.href="<i>http://www.yoursiteaddress.com/</i>roadblock.html";
}
</pre>

   We have designed some roadblocks that you are welcome to use: <a href="roadblocks/1.html">1</a> <a href="roadblocks/2.html">2</a>.  If you find one you like, choose <i>File > Save Page As...</i> and save it as roadblock.html.  You can also design your own; if you do, please <a href="../submit/#roadblock">submit your page</a> so we can offer it to other people!
   </p><br><br>

   <a name="popup"><h2>Popup ad</h2>
   <p>Opening a popup ad that calls attention to itself and promotes Firebird as a way to block such ads in the future is a delicious
      and ironic twist.  To add a popup to your site for non-Firebird users, use the following Javascript:
<pre>
if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Firebird") == -1) {
  window.open("<i>http://www.yoursiteaddress.com/</i>popup.html", 'Popup',
              'width=502,height=325,resizable=no,status=no,menubar=no,toolbar=no');
}
</pre>

      We have designed some popup ad pages that you are welcome to use: <a href="popups/1.html">1</a> <a href="popups/2.html">2</a>.  If you find one you like, choose <i>File > Save Page As...</i> and save it as popup.html.  You can also design your own; if you do, please <a href="../submit/#popup">submit your ad</a> so we can offer it to other people!
    </p><br><br>

    <a name="buttons"><h2>Buttons & Banners</h2>
    <p>The stalwarts of online advertising, these have been around since the days of "Netscape NOW" and will probably make up the bulk
       of our guerilla marketing campaign.  Adding a button or banner to your site requires basic HTML:
<pre>
&lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/"&gt;
  &lt;img src="<i>http://www.yoursiteaddress.com/</i>firebird.gif"
       alt="Download the Mozilla Firebird browser"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

       Some of you may want to show buttons or banners only to users of other browsers, which requires the following Javascript:
<pre>
if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Firebird") == -1) {
  var img = document.getElementById('firebird-ad');
  img.style.display = 'block';
}
</pre>

       and some tweaks to the HTML code above:
<pre>
&lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/"&gt;
  &lt;img id="firebird-ad" style="display: none;"
       src="<i>http://www.yoursiteaddress.com/</i>firebird.gif"
       alt="Download the Mozilla Firebird browser"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

       You are welcome to use the buttons and banners below on your site.  If you choose to design your own, please <a href="../submit/#button">submit it</a> so we can offer it to other people!</p>

       <table cellpadding="5">
         <tr>
           <td>
             <img src="images/dashboard.gif" alt="Download the Mozilla Firebid browser">
           </td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
           <td>
             <img src="images/popups.gif" alt="Download the Mozilla Firebird browser">
             <img src="images/rediscover.gif" alt="Download the Mozilla Firebid browser">
           </td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
           <td>
             <img src="images/ignite.gif" alt="Download the Mozilla Firebird browser">
             <img src="images/mozfirebird.gif" alt="Download the Mozilla Firebird browser">
           </td>
         </tr>
       </table>
       <br>
       <a name="link"><h2>Text Links</h2></a>
       <p>To add a link promoting Firebird, insert the following simple HTML:
<pre>
  &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/"&gt;Download the Mozilla Firebird browser&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

          Feel free to change the wording however you see fit (for example, you might just want it to say "Free popup-blocking software").</p>
