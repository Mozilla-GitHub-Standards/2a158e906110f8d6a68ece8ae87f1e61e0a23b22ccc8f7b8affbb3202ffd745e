<h1 align=center>mozilla development roadmap</h1>

<p>
<center><a href="mailto:brendan@mozilla.org">Brendan Eich</a>, 25-Sep-2000
</center>

<p>

<p>
Welcome to the Mozilla development roadmap.  This document briefly describes
where the Mozilla project has been, and then details where it is going.  It
proposes key "road rules" and a release schedule for ongoing Mozilla-the-browser
source milestone releases, from which anyone can build commercial and other
products.  It also hints at how Mozilla-the-platform should evolve, again from
an operational or "release process" point of view.

<h2 align=center>background</h2>

<p>
The <a href="roadmap-26-Oct-1998.html">old roadmap</a> recorded the momentous decision
in October 1998 to reset the Mozilla project around the
<a href="newlayout/">new layout engine</a> (now called Gecko), a cross-platform
front end (<a href="xpfe/">XPFE</a>),
<a href="editor/">now</a> <a href="mailnews/">several</a>
<a href="xpapps/">XP Apps</a> built on an
<a href="xpfe/xptoolkit/">XP Toolkit</a>),
and a scriptable components architecture (<a href="projects/xpcom/">XPCOM</a>
and <a href="scriptable/">XPConnect</a>).
The old roadmap helped to effect a major course change for Mozilla, but it
then failed to track the project's progress -- my fault, no excuses.
On the plus side, it did prescribe and promote a number of positive techniques
and developments in the code and in the community.  But it's old news.  Now we
need a different roadmap.

<p>
Going forward, as netscape.com prepares to ship a
<a href="http://home.netscape.com/browsers/6/">commercial product</a> based
on Mozilla, we need a roadmap that prescribes fewer technical points and more
planning and scheduling techniques.  Mozilla doesn't need new features, or any
particular "new" or "next generation" module (there will and should be module
rewrites, to be sure; there will also be new features, but I'm not about to
call for any here).  I would do a disservice to say anything on the order of
"let's charge over that next hill" when we are still finishing the current
architecture and staring down the troublesome aspects of its trade-offs (e.g.
leaks due to lack of garbage collection).

<p>
Mozilla needs performance, stability, and correctness.  We are near the last
ten percent of the "Mozilla 1.0" project, where the going gets tough.

<h2 align=center>near-term tree plan</h2>

<p>
We staff@mozilla.org propose that Netscape 6 branch for PR3 and stay on that
branch through RTM.  The trunk continues to take footprint, embedding API,
and other fixes, including landings such as IBM's BiDi branch,
<a href="mailto:roc+moz@cs.cmu.edu">roc</a>'s new view manager, ActiveState
DOM scripting support, etc.  The rules for what kind of change goes into the
trunk when, and who decides, are elaborated below under the
<a href="#new-milestones">new milestones</a> and
<a href="#project-management">project management</a> headings.

<p>
The checkin rules for the Netscape 6 branch are defined by netscape.com, and
are specified in a
<a href="news://news.mozilla.org/39C7A253.6080300%40netscape.com">message</a>
from phil@netscape.com.
Anyone not following these rules on the branch risks losing CVS access (I say
this because mozilla.org is, and must be, the ultimate authority behind vendor
branches on cvs.mozilla.org or any other mozilla.org CVS server).

<p>
The only thing mozilla.org requests of contributors committing changes to the
branch is that they immediately update the trunk with the same change, if it
is not a short-term solution that's inappropriate on the trunk (in which case,
the long-term solution should be committed to the trunk ASAP, with an open bug
tracking the lack of the long-term solution in the meanwhile).  Without trunk
updates, owners and other contributors to the branch are putting their module
ownership on the trunk at risk.  netscape.com agrees with this guideline, in
general (there may be exceptions; we will play it by ear and keep an eye out
for mounting branch deltas).

<h2 align=center>branch details</h2>

<img src="../roadmap-images/branching.png">

<p>
The Netsape 6 branch shown here starts with the PR3 (<tt>nsbeta3</tt>)
branch-point.
mozilla.org will release branded M18 milestone builds based on the <b>trunk</b>,
soon after the time that Netscape releases PR3 (this is a recent change in plans
occasioned by desire to pick up trunk fixes in M18, and to relieve pressure on
the branch from porting fixes that may unintentionally affect XP files).

<p>
Later, the Netscape 6 branch has an optional branch, somewhat arbitrarily named
"Mozilla 0.6", at the point where netscape.com does a "release to manufacturing"
(RTM) -- the last point at which code available in the branch might change
before being compiled into Netscape 6.
After this point, the branch exists only to support hypothetical Netscape 6.01,
6.02, etc., releases.

<p>
(N.B. that I am not committing netscape.com to these 6.0<i>n</i> releases.
I am only stating why the Netscape 6 branch might live beyond RTM.
Future Mozilla development should use the trunk, not any long-lived branch.)

<p>
The Mozilla 0.6 branch exists <i>only</i> to support
<a href="../projects/mathml/">MathML</a> and other
extensions or "not-quite-plugins" that may depend on Gecko internal APIs.
Mozilla users would like to pull tagged sources from which they can build a
"replacement Gecko" that includes MathML and that "drops in" to an existing
Netscape 6 installation seamlessly.

<p>
If MathML and similar extensions all happily work with the Netscape 6 branch
sources at the RTM point, then Mozilla 0.6 can be a static tag that aliases
the RTM tag, and need not be a CVS branch at all.  Otherwise, we believe a
branch off the Netscape 6 branch will be needed for whatever fixes enable
MathML, etc.
to work in a "drop in" fashion with Netscape 6.  We aim to do as little work
as possible on any such Mozilla 0.6 branch.

<a name="#code-review">
<h2 align=center>code review</h2>
</a>

<p>
mozilla.org, with help from netscape.com, is instituting code review across the
board to approve checkins.  We hope to increase code quality, better learn and
teach best-practices, and avoid immediate and lurking regressions using a group
of
<a href="hacking/reviewers.html">strong hackers</a> as
code reviewers for everyone, just as waterson@mozilla.org and
brendan@mozilla.org have been for non-netscape.com contributors so far (per
the current
<a href="http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=SeaMonkey">checkin
requirements</a>).

<p>
This new <a href="mailto:reviewers@mozilla.org">reviewers@mozilla.org</a>
group must review and approve all changes to branch and trunk,
to make sure the right trade-offs are made in the branch (short-term,
absolutely minimal risk) and to guard Mozilla's and Netscape 6's posterity in
the trunk (long-term, more risk tolerated for better but non-minimal solutions,
modulo the <a href="#new-milestones">milestone plan</a> and the wishes of
<a href="#project-management">project management</a>).

<p>
Of course, you can't test quality in, or even code-review quality into a bad
design.  For better design review and planning, the usual mozilla newsgroups
should be used (as they are today) to propose and review design changes and
new designs.  The <a href="#project-management">new project management</a>
team at mozilla.org can help, too.  But mozilla.org fundamentally deals in
code, and we need to increase our code quality.
The best way we know of to do that is to have top
hackers review all code (both changes, and the surrounding unchanged code in
each modified file).

<h2 align=center>qa and release</h2>
<p>
leaf@mozilla.org will produce nightly builds of Mozilla from the trunk and
from the Netscape 6 branch (the latter happens as a by-product of turning the
Netscape 6 commercial build crank).  The branch builds will appear under a
new milestone name, call it <tt>MN6</tt>, on ftp.mozilla.org.

<p>
asa@mozilla.org and IRC #smoketest and #qa will QA the Mozilla trunk builds
for daily verification.
asa@mozilla.org will QA <tt>MN6</tt> weekly, testing MathML
and other extensions and not-quite-plugins.

<p>
We would like to pool tinderbox machine resources to handle both branch and
trunk, producing nightly trunk builds for the Mozilla community.  We propose
to netscape.com that the branch tinderboxes build the Netscape 6 commercial tree
only; we hope this suffices for netscape.com's tinderbox needs while the branch
lives.
This change will require adding Linux, at least, to the Netscape 6 commercial
tinderbox group, but it should liberate most of the current SeaMonkey machines
to be used for the trunk.
The new mozilla.org build lab machines can make up any
difference.  leaf@mozilla.org owns the details here.

<p>
We believe that IRC #mozilla can handle sheriff duties on the trunk, with
dmose@mozilla.org and other staff helping if tree closures are needed.  If we
need an explicit sheriff duty roster, dmose@mozilla.org will work with
beppe@netscape.com, trudelle@netscape.com, and others to come up with one.

<a name="new-milestones">
<h2 align=center>new milestones</h2>
</a>

<p>
After M18, and starting with Mozilla 0.6 (the name we use to identify Mozilla
sources that went into Netscape 6), mozilla.org proposes to reset target
milestones for the Mozilla-the-application-suite products
(<tt>Browser</tt> and <tt>MailNews</tt>
at least) among the
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">bugzilla</a>
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi">products</a>, as follows:

<ul>
<li>
Old target milestones (<tt>M1</tt> through <tt>M30</tt>) will be censored
from the Target Milestone menu, to avoid clutter and confusion.
They will remain within bugzilla's database as long as old bugs refer to them,
of course.

<li>
New target milestones of the form <tt>mozilla0.6</tt>, <tt>mozilla0.9</tt>,
<tt>mozilla0.9.1</tt>, <tt>mozilla1.0</tt>, <tt>mozilla1.0.1</tt> will be
created, up to some upper bound such as <tt>mozilla1.2.1</tt> that we can
extend later.  There will still be a Future target milestone.

<li>
Dig this: these new target milestones will also be keywords.  To propose that
a bug must be fixed for <tt>mozilla1.0</tt>, anyone may add that keyword to the
bug.  To tell whether the bug is likely to be fixed by that milestone, anyone
can check the Target Milestone setting in the bug.  Developers target milestones
as usual.  No need for <tt>[nsbeta3+]</tt> or <tt>[mozilla1.0+]</tt> status
whiteboard spam!

<li>
Mozilla also needs project management, not just community effort in adding
target milestone keywords to bugs, and distributed developer initiative in
targeting new milestones appropriately.  See below
under the <a href="#project-management">project management</a> heading for more.
</ul>

<p>
The following table shows the new milestone schedule with very rough dates.
We may well slip every one of these milestones somewhat, but we're aiming at
quarterly milestones.
We do not propose to be exclusively date-driven, or else the Mozilla community
may balk at any pretense that Mozilla 1.0 deserves the "1.0" version string.
But we emphatically intend to produce regular milestones: the trains will run
more or less on time!

<p>
If you are a commercial contributor to Mozilla and your schedule has milestones
that don't align well with the proposed ones below, please mail
staff@mozilla.org asking for a finer-grained milestone, or series of milestones.
We'll try to accomodate, first ascertaining at what number of weeks can you
stand to "round up" to the next Mozilla milestone.

<p>
<table border=1 bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<tr><th align=center colspan=2>2000</th>

    <td><span class="smalltt">mozilla1.1</tt></td>
    <td><span class="smalltt">mozilla1.1.1</tt></td>
    <td><span class="smalltt">mozilla1.2</tt></td>
    <td><span class="smalltt">mozilla1.2.1</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
It's important that Mozilla developers, especially contributors planning to
release commercial products based on Mozilla code, be able to count on regular
milestones.
Developers need to know that if work initially targeted at (e.g.)
<tt>mozilla1.1</tt> slips, that work can
hop on the <tt>mozilla1.2</tt> train (remaining configured out of the default
build, or #ifdef'd off, or on a CVS branch, until then).  We believe, based on
experience gained over the last year, that a three-month cycle is realistic,
and about as short as the project can get away with when doing significant new
development, stabilization, and polish.

<p>
The <tt>mozilla1.1.1</tt> and similar
"half-way" milestones that we hope to do every six weeks are sanity-checking
milestones, to help everyone gauge how well progress toward the next quarterly
milestone is going.  If we find that six weeks is too long to go without a
stabilization mini-milestone, we can add <tt>mozilla1.1.2</tt> and so on, and
switch to a four week period.  We don't expect more than a few such minor
milestones between major ones.

<p>
While we welcome componentization, it's currently the case that all of the
Mozilla sources must be built together.  As APIs mature and we freeze them, we
hope component owners will develop their own milestone schedules and deliver
components via their own CVS tags and source (and even binary) releases.
It's the only way to scale up Mozilla and avoid excessive inter-component
dependencies.
But we still envision mozilla.org leading a cross-component milestone and
release "branding" effort, even when <tt>mozilla1.5</tt> is merely an assembly
of well-tested components coupled to one another by stable interfaces.  That
will be a happy day!

<a name="project-management">
<h2 align=center>project management</h2>
</a>

<p>
To drive developers looking to help toward bugs needing help in a timely
fashion, to moderate risk, and to help commercial projects based on Mozilla
manage their product releases, mozilla.org proposes to create a group of
project managers,
<a href="mailto:drivers@mozilla.org">drivers@mozilla.org</a>.  (We prefer a
short name like "drivers", with transportation connotations, to "project
managers").

<p>
The people we have in mind are:
<ul>
<li>David Baron, <a href="mailto:dbaron@fas.harvard.edu">dbaron@fas.harvard.edu</a>
<li>Chris Blizzard, <a href="mailto:blizzard@redhat.com">blizzard@redhat.com</a>
<li>Asa Dotzler, <a href="mailto:asa@mozilla.org">asa@mozilla.org</a>
<li>Brendan Eich, <a href="mailto:brendan@mozilla.org">brendan@mozilla.org</a>
<li>Warren Harris, <a href="mailto:warren@netscape.com">warren@netscape.com</a>
<li>Robert O'Callahan, <a href="mailto:roc+moz@cs.cmu.edu">roc+moz@cs.cmu.edu</a>
<li>Tim Rowley, <a href="mailto:tor@cs.brown.edu">tor@cs.brown.edu</a>
</ul>

<p>
We don't want to over-specify the processes these folks will use, or try to
guess what techniques they'll come up with.  We picked an odd number (seven,
not too large, lucky, and magnificent) to avoid ties.
We expect accountability and community
satisfaction from drivers (who own the project management "module"), as from
any module owner.

<p>
At a minimum, we require that the drivers use the new bugzilla target-milestone
keywords to sort bugs according to the quarterly schedule, take account of the
Mozilla community's wishes, and help deploy and recruit developers to fix the
targeted bugs in a well-ordered fashion.  The drivers should of course document
each milestone's intended and likely content, and the scheduling rationales
used to define milestones, in public documents and newsgroup postings.

<p>
Beyond that, we delegate to the drivers.
It is likely that we'll be spending a fair amount of effort tracking
dependencies, revising the schedule, and coordinating developers.
