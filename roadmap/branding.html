<h1>Mozilla branding</h1>
<p><a href="mailto:blizzard@mozilla.org">Christopher Blizzard</a>,
 25-<abbr>Apr</abbr>-2003

<h2>1. Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this document is to
 describe mozilla.org's branding strategy during and after the release of
 what has generally been called Mozilla 1.4. The strategy outlined
 in this document should be used as a reference when referring to our
 products both with the press and the general public. Mozilla
 contributors are generally pretty savvy and will follow their own
 nomenclature. This document <em>is</em>
 an attempt to help define that nomenclature, but isn't mandatory by any
 measure.

<h2>2. Goals</h2>
<p>By defining a single set of images or
 words associated with our products, and associating those images and
 words over and over with a single message we are able to both create an
 image in customer's heads about what we offer and what we stand
 for. In the end, we should be able to have a single set of ideas,
 phrases and artwork that defines who we are, what we stand for and the
 products we produce.&nbsp; When communicating with the public and the
 press it's important that we reinforce those ideas when given the
 opportunity.

<h2>3. Products</h2>
<p>Before defining how we talk about something and how we want to present
 it to the world, we should talk about what we're actually
 producing. Right now we have two basic projects:
<ol>
 <li>SeaMonkey: The SeaMonkey project is also called the
  Application Suite or "App Suite." It's largely the same as the old
  Netscape 4.x Communicator brand. It has more or less the same
  functionality and branding as that the old 4.x product and we've done
  little to counter that association.
 <li>Firefox/Thunderbird:&nbsp; These are the basis for the second
  generation mozilla products.&nbsp; They split our application into two
  separate applications with separate identities: a web browser and an
  email program.&nbsp; In talking about these projects, we should allow
  them to have their own identities.
</ol>

<h2>4. Current Brand</h2>
<p>Our current brand is largely
 associated with the previous Netscape product releases.&nbsp; When
 talking about the "open source version of Netscape" the press usually
 talks about this nebulous thing: "Mozilla" People inside of the
 project usually call it the "app suite" or sometimes they separate the
 "browser" or "mail/news," but it is almost always referred to as a
 "release of Mozilla" when we reach a milestone.
<p>From now on we should try to capitalize on the mozilla name, as it is
 already well known and is widely used outside of our small technical
 community. However, once we have got a logical split of the
 browser and mail/news into separately run projects, we should use the
 brand we have while allowing the two main parts (and other parts, in the
 future) to have their own identities, while still reinforcing the
 mozilla name.

<h2>5. Rules of the Game</h2>
<p>Before and during the release of
 Mozilla 1.4, we need to make sure that we can keep our new development
 work (Thunderbird/Firefox) separate from SeaMonkey. There are
 quite a few reasons to do this, including making sure that we can keep
 the right bugs in the right place (the technical reasons) and to avoid
 any kind of brand confusion in the marketplace or in the press (branding
 reason.) This gives us our rules of the game:
<p class="important">1. When referring to a
 SeaMonkey-based release use the phrase "Mozilla Application Suite" as
 the name of the app suite.
<p>It's not sexy, and people will probably shorten it to "App Suite" or
just "Mozilla" but we want to make sure that it's made distinct from the
upcoming Browser and Mail products.
<p class="important">2. When referring to specific
parts of the Application Suite, use Mozilla Navigator and Mozilla
Messenger.
<p>Sometimes we need to refer to specific parts of the App Suite.&nbsp;
 These names have been around a long time and were inherited from the old
 Netscape products and we should probably stick to them.&nbsp; Also, they
 are distinct from Browser and Mail which is important in the long run.
<p class="important">3. When referring to Thunderbird or
 Firebird before or during the 1.4 release cycle, make sure to use the
 project name with Mozilla pre-pended as "Mozilla Thunderbird" or
 "Mozilla Firefox" instead of Mozilla alone or Firebird/Thunderbird
 alone.
<p>After the release of 1.4 we will be doing our primary development on
 the Firefox and Thunderbird projects.&nbsp; When we do releases of that
 codebase we should be using self-descriptive brand identities for the
 public and the press. New rule:
<p class="important">4. Use the names "Mozilla
 Browser" and "Mozilla Mail" to describe the Firefox and Thunderbird
 projects after the 1.4 release.
<p>Also, this branding should be found throughout the projects if possible
 instead of referring to the Firefox and Thunderbird names
 directly. Project names are transitory.&nbsp; As long as we have
 both a mail and browser project, we should be using the mozilla brand
 and reinforcing it whenever we get the chance.

<h2>6. Product Naming in resources,
 executables and on the desktop</h2>
<p>The Mozilla Browser and Mail programs
 should try to stick to the mozilla product name whenever possible, even
 in resource names. For example, registry keys would use a key name
 that includes "MozillaBrowser" or "Mozilla/Browser."&nbsp; For an
 executable you might use MozillaBrowser, mozilla-browser, mozbrwsr.exe
 or mozilla-browser.exe, depending on your platform.&nbsp; Desktop links
 should include the full name of the product, when possible.&nbsp; This
 means the entire phrase "Mozilla Browser" should be used in desktop
 links and files.&nbsp; Profiles should also reflect the product name, if
 possible.&nbsp; This means using ~/.mozilla-browser on Unix or
 MozillaBrowser on Windows.
