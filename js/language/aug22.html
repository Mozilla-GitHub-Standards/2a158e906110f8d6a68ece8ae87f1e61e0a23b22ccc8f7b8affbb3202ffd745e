<H1>Notes from August 22, 2000 meeting between Waldemar Horwat and Herman Venter</H1>

<P>General: Herman is readying an implementation of JScript for servers and wants to freeze the language and make it easily
interoperable with Microsoft's .NET runtime. Waldemar is concerned about the language's applicability to browsers and retaining
the language's dynamism, which he sees as the language's differentiator. He's concerned about the language's drift towards
Java or C# because he thinks that there is little need for another language in that space, and the result would be inferior
to C# for static programming anyway. Herman also recommends that new server projects use C# instead of JScript, seeing the
new JScript as a language geared towards developers already used to programming in JScript.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Strict mode: Herman would like to eliminate it from Edition 4 and leave it as extensions for Netscape and Microsoft
    to implement. Waldemar is willing to agree but is worried about divergence between Netscape's and Microsoft's strict modes
    (Microsoft's called Option Fast). Herman says that Microsoft's Option Fast serves a different purpose from Netscape's
    strict mode. Waldemar would like input from the rest of the group.</LI>
  <LI>Herman would prefer to eliminate the <CODE>3_in</CODE> syntax for units, leaving only <CODE>3in</CODE> and <CODE>3&nbsp;"in"</CODE>.
    Waldemar is OK with that, subject to agreement from the rest of the group.</LI>
  <LI>Herman expressed some willingness to accept the <CODE>::</CODE> notation for namespace qualification and doesn't think
    that it would fatally clash with Microsoft's current usage of <CODE>::</CODE>. The plain <CODE>.</CODE> doesn't work for
    a member qualifier -- <CODE>a.b.c</CODE> is interpreted as <CODE>(a.b).c</CODE> rather than <CODE>a.(b.c)</CODE>. Waldemar
    dropped the semantics of supplying multiple namespaces to a single member lookup: <CODE>a::b::c</CODE> used to mean "look
    up the <CODE>c</CODE> that is in both namespaces <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>b</CODE>"; now <CODE>x.a::b::c</CODE> means
    <CODE>x.(a.b)::c</CODE> -- <CODE>a.b</CODE> should evaluate to a namespace in which the name <CODE>c</CODE> is looked
    up. Herman suggested the syntax <CODE>x::a.b.c</CODE> instead of <CODE>x.a::b::c</CODE>, but Waldemar doesn't like it
    because it goes counter to C++ expectations and associates in the wrong way: one would have to write <CODE>(x::a.b.c).d</CODE>
    instead of <CODE>x.a::b::c.d</CODE>.</LI>
  <LI>Waldemar clarified that, when <CODE>a</CODE> is not preceded by a dot, either <CODE>a::b</CODE> or <CODE>a.b</CODE>
    can be used to look up member <CODE>b</CODE> of namespace <CODE>a</CODE>.</LI>
  <LI>By Herman's request, Waldemar took the <CODE>@</CODE> operator out of the Edition 4 proposal. It will be a Netscape
    extension.</LI>
  <LI>Waldemar suggested that there be some way to make compile-time array constants (something like <CODE>[3,4]</CODE> doesn't
    work because it creates a mutable array) and/or read-only arrays, but no consensus was reached.</LI>
  <LI>Waldemar added attributes that take arguments to his proposal and figured out a way of doing it while keeping the grammar
    LR(1).</LI>
  <LI>Herman does not want scope blocks (i.e. <CODE>scope{</CODE>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<CODE>}</CODE> creating a local scope) in
    Edition 4. Waldemar is unhappy about that because the working group spent several days on this subject and earlier appeared
    to reach consensus to keep them but would go along if the rest of the group wants to drop them, in which case they would
    become a Netscape extension.</LI>
  <LI>Herman does not want attribute blocks (i.e. <CODE>private{</CODE>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<CODE>}</CODE> distributing the <CODE>private</CODE>
    attribute among the declarations in ...) in Edition 4. Waldemar is also unhappy about that but would go along if the rest
    of the group wants to drop them, in which case they would become a Netscape extension.</LI>
  <LI>Microsoft currently accepts <CODE>catch&nbsp;(x:RangeError)</CODE> but not <CODE>var&nbsp;x:RangeError</CODE>. Waldemar
    doesn't think that this is a significant issue if <CODE>RangeError</CODE> is a host object.</LI>
  <LI>Waldemar expects to be able to write <CODE>var&nbsp;x:foo</CODE> if <CODE>foo</CODE> is an Edition 3-style constructor
    of prototype-based classes; this would mean that <CODE>x</CODE> can hold any object that has <CODE>foo.prototype</CODE>
    on the prototype chain. Herman has some reservations.</LI>
  <LI>Herman doesn't like the <CODE>volatile</CODE> attribute and would like to rename it to <CODE>virtual</CODE>. Waldemar
    agrees. There already is a <CODE>virtual</CODE> attribute and the issue of what the new <CODE>virtual</CODE> would mean
    was not discussed; there probably is disagreement there regarding whether the overriding method must match the base method's
    signature or not.</LI>
  <LI>In addition to the <CODE>override</CODE> attribute, Microsoft has a <CODE>hide</CODE> attribute that creates a new vtable
    entry rather than reusing an existing vtable entry. Operationally, <CODE>hide</CODE> and <CODE>override</CODE> appear
    to be equivalent for code that dispatches on untyped variables, but their behavior differs when dispatching on variables
    with static types. Waldemar says that <CODE>hide</CODE> breaks the Dollin principle. Agreed that <CODE>hide</CODE> will
    be a Microsoft extension rather than a feature of Edition 4.</LI>
  <LI>Herman asked about <CODE>mayOverride</CODE>. Waldemar explained that they are useful for writing scripts that define
    a method that is present in the base class on some implementations/platforms but not on others.</LI>
  <LI>Herman doesn't want to have anti-attributes (attributes such as <CODE>implicit</CODE>, <CODE>instance</CODE>, <CODE>concrete</CODE>,
    etc. that negate other attributes), saying that they are unnecessary. Waldemar wants to keep them to turn off attributes
    that were earlier turned on by user-defined attributes. No agreement.</LI>
  <LI>Herman asked about the <CODE>explicit</CODE> attribute. Waldemar explained that it's necessary for versioning to declare
    a new version name itself in a way so that it cannot clash with a name defined in another package, solving a problem discovered
    by Dave Raggett in an earlier meeting. Agreed to keep it.</LI>
  <LI>Herman doesn't want user-defined attributes to be combinations of existing attributes (i.e. defining <CODE>const&nbsp;spriv1&nbsp;=&nbsp;static&nbsp;private&nbsp;Version1</CODE>
    and then using <CODE>spriv1</CODE> as an attribute). Waldemar thinks that they are an important abstraction mechanism,
    enabling one to switch attributes on a large number of definitions by editing one line of code. No agreement.</LI>
  <LI>Microsoft has an <CODE>expando</CODE> attribute that one can put on a class to allow instances to hold ad-hoc properties.
    In light of the previous agreement to restrict ad-hoc properties to only classes that are marked as allowing them, this
    is clearly needed. Waldemar will add it (perhaps proposing a different name) to Netscape's proposal.</LI>
  <LI>Microsoft has a <CODE>protected</CODE> attribute, where <CODE>protected</CODE> means accessible only in subclasses (like
    in C++ but not like in Java, where the local package can also access the definition). Waldemar doesn't care whether this
    is in the language or not.</LI>
  <LI>Herman doesn't want to have the <CODE>local</CODE>, <CODE>scope</CODE>, and <CODE>global</CODE> attributes. This topic
    needs further discussion, especially since there was consensus in an earlier meeting (<A href="http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/tc39/mod9910.htm">October
    1999</A>) to have at least some of them.</LI>
  <LI>Herman doesn't want the language to have the "early Pascal" behavior where in the program
    <PRE>const x = 10;
{
   a = x;
   ...
   if (foo)
      const x:t = 20;
}</PRE>

    variable <CODE>a</CODE> gets the value <CODE>10</CODE>. Waldemar says that this behavior, or something similar, is essential
    to support Netscape's dynamic superset of Edition 4. There was a little progress, but no definite agreement was reached.</LI>
  <LI>Microsoft uses <CODE>static&nbsp;{</CODE>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<CODE>}</CODE> as a static initializer inside a class and does
    not allow anything other than definitions inside a class. Netscape treats it <CODE>static&nbsp;{</CODE>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<CODE>}</CODE>
    as distributing the <CODE>static</CODE> attribute among the definitions inside the block. Netscape allows ordinary code
    inside a class; that code is executed at the time the class is defined; local variables can be created using the <CODE>local</CODE>
    attribute. No agreement.</LI>
  <LI>Herman says that classes should be initialized lazily on first use. Waldemar says that classes should be initialized
    as part of their package loading process. No agreement.</LI>
  <LI>Herman would prefer to not have anything other than class definitions inside a package but was willing to allow other
    things (that would be internally collected into a special class). Waldemar wants to allow arbitrary code inside a package.</LI>
  <LI>Herman has some reservations about <CODE>export</CODE>. Waldemar wants the facility in some form, although is willing
    to change the syntax.</LI>
  <LI>Herman would like to issue a warning about declarations that mix typed and untyped variables such as <CODE>var&nbsp;x,y:Integer</CODE>,
    where <CODE>x</CODE>'s type is actually <CODE>Object</CODE>. This is a consequence of us adopting the Pascal-style syntax
    rather than the C-style <CODE>var&nbsp;Integer x,y</CODE>. Waldemar agrees.</LI>
  <LI>Herman suggested syntax distinguishing constant definitions from compile-time constant definitions. Waldemar pointed
    out that this was what <CODE>compile</CODE> blocks (which were dropped at a previous meeting) had been designed to accomplish.</LI>
  <LI>Waldemar clarified that <CODE>any</CODE> has been replaced by <CODE>Object</CODE>; he hadn't gone through the entire
    web site with the search-and-replace yet.</LI>
  <LI>Herman presented a way of interpreting literal numbers as either IEEE doubles or 64-bit integers without loss of precision
    and without using source code tags. Waldemar is curious but needs more details to understand the proposal and its implications.</LI>
  <LI>Herman would prefer that every constant declaration also include a definition: <CODE>const &nbsp;x:t=expr</CODE>. Waldemar
    currently allows a constant to be declared before it is defined: <CODE>const&nbsp;x:t</CODE>; ... <CODE>const x=expr</CODE>.
    Waldemar will look into why he had thought that this was necessary and agreed to drop it from Edition 4 if it turns out
    to be unnecessary.</LI>
  <LI>Waldemar's proposal has named class constructors that are callable as though they were static methods of a class. Herman
    said that it would be difficult to implement two different class constructors with the same signature but later found
    a way to do this.</LI>
  <LI>There was some disagreement about the constructor syntax. Herman wants to use the Java-style syntax of declaring a function
    with the same name as a class. Waldemar wants to use the <CODE>constructor</CODE> keyword instead of the <CODE>function</CODE>
    keyword. Waldemar agreed to make <CODE>constructor</CODE> into an attribute so that one would declare a constructor using
    <CODE>constructor&nbsp;function&nbsp;f(</CODE>...<CODE>) {</CODE>...<CODE>}</CODE> instead of just <CODE>constructor&nbsp;f(</CODE>...<CODE>){</CODE>...<CODE>}</CODE>.
    The <CODE>constructor</CODE> attribute would be optional if <CODE>f</CODE> was the name of the class. However, Waldemar
    thinks that giving special meaning to a method that has the same name as the class is confusing.</LI>
  <LI>Herman doesn't want the rest parameter to be able to take named arguments because of efficiency reasons. After some
    discussion it turned out that the inefficiency can be avoided for the cases where the rest parameter is defined as a typed
    array because typed arrays don't accept named arguments. If the rest parameter has no type or is a plain array then the
    code appears to be no less efficient than a plain dynamic dispatch where the signature of the method is not known at all.
    Herman reluctantly agreed to allow the rest parameter to accept named arguments but only if there are no parameters other
    than the rest parameter. Waldemar insists on no such restriction. No agreement yet.</LI>
  <LI>Discussed whether static class members should be visible via instances. Microsoft is evenly split into two camps on
    this issue. Waldemar says that static members should be separate from instance members to match Edition 3's behavior:
    In edition 3, a static member of a prototype-based "class" <CODE>c</CODE> is a member of the object <CODE>c</CODE>
    and is not present on the prototype chain of <CODE>c</CODE>'s instances. Members of <CODE>c.prototype</CODE> are not static
    members of <CODE>c</CODE> for a couple of reasons: they can't be accessed via the syntax <CODE>c.foo()</CODE>, and writing
    to one through an instance creates a copy inside that instance rather than modifying it in place.</LI>
  <LI>Herman would like to use the <CODE>super.foo()</CODE> syntax to call a method of a superclass. Waldemar prefers the
    <CODE>this.super::foo()</CODE> syntax but agreed to also support Microsoft's syntax.</LI>
  <LI>Agreed that for security reasons there should be no way to access a method of a specific ancestor class other than via
    <CODE>super</CODE>.</LI>
  <LI>There was a long discussion about packages and their names. Herman wants the names integrated into the .NET namespace,
    so that a package is defined using a dot-separated name and imported using a dot-separated name, with the system taking
    care of figuring out where the package lives and how to load it. Waldemar points out that dot-separated names are meaningless
    in a client environment, where a script that imports a package located somewhere on the web would most likely identify
    that package using some URI. Waldemar also has parsing difficulties with the language grammar if dot-separated names are
    allowed for package names. Tentatively agreed on a compromise where a package is defined using a dot-separated name and
    can be imported using either a dot-separated name or a string. The interpretation of the string would be host-defined
    (on a host such as a browser the string could hold a URI).</LI>
  <LI>In Microsoft's current implementation, executing <CODE>import&nbsp;foo.bar.baz</CODE> causes a global variable <CODE>foo</CODE>
    to be defined. This can be a problem if <CODE>foo</CODE> is already used for something else. Agreed that this will behavior
    will not be in Edition 4; to access a package via a name, the import statement will explicitly have to introduce an alias
    name for the package: <CODE>import&nbsp;f=foo.bar.baz</CODE>.</LI>
  <LI>Herman doesn't like the <CODE>use&nbsp;import</CODE> syntax and says that opening the package's namespace should be
    the default. Waldemar agreed to rename <CODE>use&nbsp;import</CODE> (the kind that makes a package's globals available
    without qualification) to <CODE>import</CODE> and <CODE>import</CODE> (the kind that makes requires qualification) to
    <CODE>qualified&nbsp;import</CODE>.</LI>
  <LI>Herman and Waldemar agreed to late-bound dispatch for operator overloads. Waldemar will take a look again at the C#
    syntax for declaring operator overloads and will come up with suggestions for Edition 4. (The current syntax in Netscape's
    proposal is out of date.)</LI>
  <LI>Did not discuss ways to use reserved words as identifiers.</LI>
  <LI>Did not discuss typed arrays. This looks like it may be a contentious issue.</LI>
  <LI>Discussed class extensions (declaring methods of existing classes such as <CODE>String</CODE>), but not in detail. Waldemar
    says that users have been demanding this functionality.</LI>
  <LI>Herman would like more motivation for the <CODE>use</CODE> statement that selects the version and options (strict, etc.)
    of the language.</LI>
