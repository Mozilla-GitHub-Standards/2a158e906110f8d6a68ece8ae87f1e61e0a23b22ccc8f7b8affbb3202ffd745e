<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>When does a declaration (of a value, function, type, class, method, pragma, etc.) take effect? When are expressions evaluated?
The answers to these questions distinguish among major kinds of programming languages. Let's consider a function definition
such as:</P>

<PRE>function f(widget x) gadget {
  if ((gizmo)(x) != null)
    return (gizmo)(x);
  return x.owner;
}</PRE>

<P>In a static language such as Java or C++, all type expressions are evaluated at compile time. Thus, in this example <CODE>widget</CODE>
and <CODE>gadget</CODE> would be evaluated at compile time. If <CODE>gizmo</CODE> were a type, then it too would be evaluated
at compile time (<CODE>(gizmo)(x)</CODE> would become a type cast). Note that we have to be able to statically distinguish
identifiers used for variables from identifiers used for types so we can decide whether <CODE>(gizmo)(x)</CODE> is a one-argument
function call (in which case <CODE>gizmo</CODE> would be evaluated at run time) or a type cast (in which case <CODE>gizmo</CODE>
would be evaluated at compile time). In most cases, in a static language a declaration is visible throughout its enclosing
scope, although there are exceptions that have been deemed too complicated for a compiler to handle such as the following
C++:</P>

<PRE>typedef int *x;

class foo {
  typedef x *y;
  typedef char *x;
}</PRE>

<P>Many dynamic languages can construct, evaluate, and manipulate type expressions at run time. Some dynamic languages (such
as Common Lisp) distinguish between compile time and run time and provide constructs (<CODE>eval-when</CODE>) to evaluate
expressions early. The simplest dynamic languages (such as Scheme) process input in a single pass and do not distinguish between
compile time and run time. If we evaluated the above function in such a simple language, <CODE>widget</CODE> and <CODE>gadget</CODE>
would be evaluated at the time the function is called.</P>

<H3><A name="challenges"></A>Challenges</H3>

<P>JavaScript is a scripting language. Many programmers wish to write JavaScript scripts embedded in web pages that work in
a variety of environments. Some of these environments may provide libraries that a script would like to use, while on other
environments the script may have to emulate those libraries. Let's take a look at an example of something one would expect
to be able to easily do in a scripting language:</P>

<P>Bob is writing a script for a web page that wants to take advantage of an optional package <CODE>MacPack</CODE> that is
present on some environments (Macintoshes) but not on others. <CODE>MacPack</CODE> provides a class <CODE>HyperWindoid</CODE>
from which Bob wants to subclass his own class <CODE>BobWindoid</CODE>. On other platforms Bob has to define an emulation
class <CODE>BobWindoid</CODE>' that is implemented differently from <CODE>BobWindoid</CODE> -- it has a different set of private
methods and slots. There also is a class <CODE>WindoidGuide</CODE> in Bob's package; the code and method signatures of classes
<CODE>BobWindoid</CODE> and <CODE>BobWindoid</CODE>' refer to objects of type <CODE>WindoidGuide</CODE>, and class <CODE>WindoidGuide</CODE>'s
code refers to objects of type <CODE>BobWindoid</CODE> (or <CODE>BobWindoid</CODE>' as appropriate).</P>

<P>If JavaScript uses the streaming execution model (described below), declarations take effect only when executed, and Bob
can implement his package as shown below. The <CODE>package</CODE> keyword in front of both definitions of class <CODE>BobWindoid</CODE>
lifts these definitions from the local <CODE>if</CODE> scope to the top level of Bob's package.</P>

<PRE>if (onMac()) {
  import "MacPack";

  package class BobWindoid extends HyperWindoid {
    private slot x;
    slot WindoidGuide g;

    private method speck() {...};
    public method zoom(WindoidGuide a, HyperWindoid uncle = null) WindoidGuide {...};
  }
} else {
  // emulation class BobWindoid'
  package class BobWindoid {
    private slot integer i, j;
    slot WindoidGuide g;

    private method advertise(WindoidGuide h) WindoidGuide {...};
    private method subscribe(WindoidGuide h) WindoidGuide {...};
    public method zoom(WindoidGuide a) WindoidGuide {...};
  }
}

class WindoidGuide {
  slot BobWindoid currentWindoid;

  method introduce(BobWindoid arg) BobWindoid {...};
}</PRE>

<P>On the other hand, if the language were static (meaning that types are compile-time expressions), Bob would run into problems.
How could he declare the two alternatives for the class <CODE>BobWindoid</CODE>?</P>

<P>Bob's first thought was to split his package into three HTML <TT>SCRIPT</TT> tags (containing <CODE>BobWindoid</CODE>,
<CODE>BobWindoid</CODE>', and <CODE>WindoidGuide</CODE>) and turn one of the first two off depending on the platform. Unfortunately
this doesn't work because he gets type errors if he separates the definition of class <CODE>BobWindoid</CODE> (or <CODE>BobWindoid</CODE>')
from the definition of <CODE>WindoidGuide</CODE> because these classes mutually refer to each other. Furthermore, Bob would
like to share the script among many pages, so he'd like to have the entire script in a single <TT>BobUtilities.js</TT> file.</P>

<P>Note that this problem would be newly introduced by JavaScript 2.0 if it were to evaluate type expressions at compile time.
JavaScript 1.x does not suffer from this problem because it does not have a concept of evaluating an expression at compile
time, and it is relatively easy to conditionally define a class (which is merely a function) by declaring a single global
variable <VAR>g</VAR> and conditionally assigning either one or another anonymous function to it.</P>

<P>There exist alternatives in between the streaming execution model and the static model that also solve Bob's problem. <A href="#conditional-compilation">One
of them</A> is described at the end of this chapter.</P>

<H2>Streaming Execution Model</H2>

<P>JavaScript 2.0 follows the <I>streaming execution model</I> -- the entire program is processed in one pass. Unlike in JavaScript
1.x, declarations take effect only when they are executed. A declaration that is never executed is ignored.</P>

<P>The streaming execution model considerably simplifies the language and allows a JavaScript 2.0 interpreter to treat programs
read from a file identically to programs typed in via an interactive console. Also, a JavaScript 2.0 interpreter or just-in-time
compiler may start to execute a script even before it has finished downloading all of it. This was not possible in JavaScript
1.x because the interpreter was required to scan the entire program for declarations in one pass before executing any of the
code in the following pass. Streaming also simplifies the execution model for web pages that contain multiple JavaScript scripts
and permits one to safely coalesce adjacent <TT>SCRIPT</TT> tags on a page or divide a single <TT>SCRIPT</TT> tag into several.</P>

<P>One of the most significant advantages of streaming is that it allows JavaScript 2.0 scripts to turn parts of themselves
on and off based on dynamically obtained information. For example, a script or library could define additional functions and
classes if it runs on an environment that supports CSS unit arithmetic while still working on environments that do not.</P>

<P>The streaming execution model requires identifiers naming functions and variables to be defined before they are used. A
use occurs when an identifier is read, written, or called, at which point that identifier is resolved to a variable or a function
according to the scoping rules. A reference from within a control statement such as <CODE>if</CODE> and <CODE>while</CODE>
located outside a function is resolved only when execution reaches the reference. References from within the body of a function
are resolved only after the function is called; for efficiency, an implementation is allowed to resolve all references within
a function or method that does not contain <CODE>eval</CODE> at the first time the function is called.</P>

<P>According to these rules, the following program is correct and would print <CODE>7</CODE>:</P>

<PRE>function f(integer a) integer {
  return a+b;
}

var integer b = 4;
print(f(3));</PRE>

<P>Assuming that variable <CODE>b</CODE> is predefined by the host if <CODE>featurePresent</CODE> is true, this program would
also work:</P>

<PRE>function f(integer a) integer {
  return a+b;
}

if (!featurePresent) {
  package var integer b = 4;
}

print(f(3));</PRE>

<P>On the other hand, the following program would produce an error because <CODE>f</CODE> is referenced before it is defined:</P>

<PRE>print(f(3));

function f(integer a) integer {
  return a*2;
}</PRE>

<P>Defining mutually recursive functions is not a problem as long as one defines all of them before calling them.</P>

<DIV class=issue>

  <H2>Discussion</H2>

  <H3>Compiling The Streaming Model</H3>

  <P>Perhaps the easiest way to compile a script under the streaming model is to accumulate function definitions unprocessed
  and compile them only when they are first called. Many JITs do this anyway because this lets them avoid the overhead of
  compiling functions that are never called. This process does not impose any more of an overhead than the static model would
  because under the static model the compiler would need to either scan the source code twice or save all of it unprocessed
  during the first pass for processing in the second pass.</P>

  <P>Compiling a streaming model script off-line also does not present special difficulties as long as <CODE>eval</CODE> is
  restricted to not introduce additional declarations that shadow existing ones (if <CODE>eval</CODE> is allowed to do this,
  it would present problems for any execution model, including the static one). Under the streaming execution model, once
  the compiler has reached the end of a scope it can assume that that scope is complete; at that point all identifiers inside
  that scope can be resolved to the same extent that they would be in the static model.</P>

  <H3><A name="conditional-compilation"></A>Conditional Compilation Alternative</H3>

  <P><A href="#challenges">Bob's problem</A> could also be solved by using conditional compilation similar in spirit to C's
  preprocessor. If we do this, we have to ask about how expressive the conditional compilation meta-language should be. C's
  preprocessor is too weak. In JavaScript applications we'd often find that we need the full power of JavaScript so that we
  can inspect the DOM, the environment, etc. when deciding how to control compilation. Besides, using JavaScript as the meta-language
  would reduce the number of languages that a programmer would have to learn.</P>

  <P>Here's one sketch of how this could be done:</P>

  <UL>
    <LI>Execution of a script occurs in a series of passes. The last one is called <I>run time</I>. It is preceded by a <I>compile
      time</I> pass, which is preceded (if necessary) by a <I>compile compile time</I> pass, which is preceded (if necessary)
      by a <I>compile compile compile time</I> pass, etc. Having anything beyond a <I>compile compile time</I> pass is very
      rare, but rapid-development tools could generate such code.</LI>
    <LI>All definitions made in a previous pass (such as compile time) are also visible in a later pass (such as run time).
      If we define a type to also be a function that casts its argument to it type, this allows an implementation to not worry
      about whether <CODE>(x)(y)</CODE> is a function call of function <CODE>x</CODE> or a cast of <CODE>y</CODE> to type
      <CODE>x</CODE>.</LI>
    <LI><SPAN class=nonterminal>TypeExpression</SPAN>s are evaluated at compile time. These appear as types of variables, constants,
      and fields; argument and result types of functions and methods; and superclasses.</LI>
    <LI>Declarations are accumulated at compile time. Variables are declared, but variable initializers are not evaluated.
      Functions and classes are declared and defined at compile time.</LI>
    <LI>One can lift a <SPAN class=nonterminal>Block</SPAN> from run time to compile time by preceding the block with a <CODE>#</CODE>
      symbol. For example, <CODE>#{var&nbsp;int&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;3}</CODE> defines a compile-time constant x and initializes
      it to 3. One can also lift a <CODE>var</CODE>, <CODE>const</CODE>, or <CODE>function</CODE> declaration directly by
      preceding it with a <CODE>#</CODE> symbol, so <CODE>#var&nbsp;int&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;3;</CODE> would accomplish the
      same thing.</LI>
    <LI>Any <SPAN class=nonterminal>TypeExpression</SPAN>s in blocks or statements lifted to compile time are evaluated at compile
      compile time. <CODE>int</CODE> in the preceding example is such a <SPAN class=nonterminal>TypeExpression</SPAN>.</LI>
    <LI>Any block or statement that is lifted twice (as in <CODE>#{#var&nbsp;int&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;3}</CODE>) is evaluated
      at compile compile time, and so forth.</LI>
    <LI>The compile time pass can selectively exclude source code statements from the run time pass using the construct below.
      If the first <SPAN class=nonterminal>Expression</SPAN> is true, the first <SPAN class=nonterminal>Statements</SPAN> list
      is included in the run time pass. Otherwise, if the second <SPAN class=nonterminal>Expression</SPAN> is true, the second
      <SPAN class=nonterminal>Statements</SPAN> list is included in the run time pass, and so on.<BR>
      <DIV class=grammar-rule><CODE class=terminal-keyword>#</CODE>&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>if</CODE>&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>(</CODE>&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Expression</SPAN>&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>)</CODE>&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Statements</SPAN>&nbsp;[<CODE class=terminal-keyword>#</CODE>&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>else</CODE>&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>if</CODE>&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>(</CODE>&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Expression</SPAN>&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>)</CODE>&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Statements</SPAN>]&nbsp;...&nbsp;[<CODE class=terminal-keyword>#</CODE>&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>else</CODE>&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Statements</SPAN>]&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>#</CODE>&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>end</CODE>&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>if</CODE></DIV>
    </LI>
    <LI>Unlike in C, the <SPAN class=nonterminal>Statements</SPAN> above must have balanced parentheses, braces, brackets, etc.
      Also, unlike in C, preprocessing is not line-oriented; <CODE>#</CODE>'s can appear anywhere on a line.</LI>
    <LI>The compile compile time pass can use <CODE>#if</CODE> to conditionally exclude compile time code, etc.</LI>
  </UL>

  <P>Note that because variable initializers are not evaluated at compile time, one has to use <CODE>#var a = int</CODE> rather
  than <CODE>var a = int</CODE> to define an alias <CODE>a</CODE> for a type name <CODE>int</CODE>.</P>

  <P>This sketch does not address many issues that would have to be resolved, such as how typed variables are handled after
  they are declared but before they are initialized (this problem doesn't arise in the streaming model), how the lexical scopes
  of the run time pass would interact with scoping of the compile time pass, etc.</P>

  <H3>Comparing Streaming with Conditional Compilation</H3>

  <P>Both approaches solve Bob's problem, but they differ in other areas. In the sequel "conditional compilation"
  refers to the conditional compilation alternative described above.</P>

  <UL>
    <LI>The streaming model is simpler to describe and analyze.</LI>
    <LI>The streaming model is easier to learn for non-programmers.</LI>
    <LI>Conditional compilation is more familar to C/C++ programmers.</LI>
    <LI>Conditional compilation requires either a control meta-language or facilities for lifting execution from run to compile
      time. These often have unintended consequences (compile-time evaluation does not follow the same scopes as run-time
      evaluation) and have been a significant source of problems in Common Lisp.</LI>
    <LI>Conditional compilation can more faithfully emulate JavaScript 1.x semantics because it allows a function to be called
      at the top level before it is defined.</LI>
    <LI>Conditional compilation cannot guarantee that variables' initializers have been run before the variables are referenced.
      The streaming model guarantees that.</LI>
    <LI>Conditional compilation does not allow one to use general prototype-based types because prototypes are often calculated
      at run time. The streaming model allows these.</LI>
    <LI>Conditional compilation does not support functors and templates without significant additional syntax. The streaming
      model naturally extends to these.</LI>
  </UL>
