<H2>Motivation</H2>

<P>As a package evolves over time it often becomes necessary to change its exported interface. Most of these changes involve
adding symbols (global and class members), although occasionally a symbol may be deleted or renamed. In a monolithic environment
where all JavaScript source code comes preassembled from the same source, this is not a problem. On the other hand, if packages
are dynamically linked from several sources then versioning problems are likely to arise.</P>

<P>One of the most common avoidable problems is collision of symbols. Unless we solve this problem, an author of a library
will not be able to add even one symbol in a future version of his library because that symbol could already be in use by
some client or some other library that a client also links with. This problem occurs both in the global namespace and in the
namespaces within classes from which clients are allowed to inherit.</P>

<H3><A name="collision"></A>Example</H3>

<P>Here's an example of how such a collision can arise. Suppose that a library provider creates a library called <CODE>BitTracker</CODE>
that exports a class <CODE>Data</CODE>. This library becomes so successful that it is bundled with all web browsers produced
by the BrowsersRUs company:</P>

<PRE>package BitTracker;

public class Data {
  public field author;
  public field contents;
  function save() {...}
};

function store(d) {
  ...
  storeOnFastDisk(d);
}</PRE>

<P>Now someone else writes a web page <VAR>W</VAR> that takes advantage of <CODE>BitTracker</CODE>. The class <CODE>Picture</CODE>
derives from <CODE>Data</CODE> and adds, among other things, a method called <CODE>size</CODE> that returns the dimensions
of the picture:</P>

<PRE>import BitTracker;

class Picture extends Data {
  public method size() {...}
  field palette;
};

function orientation(d) {
  if (d.size().h &gt;= d.size().v)
    return "Landscape";
  else
    return "Portrait";
}</PRE>

<P>The author of the <CODE>BitTracker</CODE> library, who hasn't seen <VAR>W</VAR>, decides in response to customer requests
to add a method called <CODE>size</CODE> that returns the number of bytes of data in a <CODE>Data</CODE> object. He then releases
the new and improved <CODE>BitTracker</CODE> library. BrowsersRUs includes this library with its latest NavigatorForInternetComputing
17.0 browser:</P>

<PRE>package BitTracker;

public class Data {
  public field author;
  public field contents;
  public method size() {...}
  function save() {...}
};

function store(d) {
  ...
  if (d.size() &gt; limit)
    storeOnSlowDisk(d);
  else
    storeOnFastDisk(d);
}</PRE>

<P>An unsuspecting user <VAR>U</VAR> upgrades his old BrowsersRUs browser to the latest NavigatorForInternetComputing 17.0
browser and a week later is dismayed to find that page <VAR>W</VAR> doesn't work anymore. <VAR>U</VAR>'s granddaughter Alyssa
P. Hacker tries to explain to <VAR>U</VAR> that he's experiencing a name conflict on the <CODE>size</CODE> methods, but <VAR>U</VAR>
has no idea what she is talking about. <VAR>U</VAR> attempts to contact the author of <VAR>W</VAR>, but she has moved on to
other pursuits and is on a self-discovery mission to sub-Saharan Africa. Now <VAR>U</VAR> is steaming at BrowsersRUs, which
in turn is pointing its finger at the author of <CODE>BitTracker</CODE>.</P>

<H3>Solutions</H3>

<P>How could the author of <CODE>BitTracker</CODE> have avoided this problem? Simply choosing a name other than <CODE>size</CODE>
wouldn't work, because there could be some other page <VAR>W2</VAR> that conflicts with the new name. There are several possible
approaches:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Naming conventions</B>. We could require each symbol to be prefixed by the full name of the party from which this
    symbol originates. Unfortunately, this would get tedious and unnecessarily impact casual uses of the language. Furthermore,
    this approach is impractical for the names of methods because it is often desirable to share the same method name across
    several classes to attain polymorphism; this would not be possible if Netscape's objects all used the <CODE>com_netscape_length</CODE>
    method while MIT's objects used the <CODE>edu_mit_length</CODE> method.</LI>
  <LI><B>Explicit imports</B>. We could require each client package to import every external symbol it references. This works
    reasonably well for global symbols but becomes tedious for the names of class members, which would have to be imported
    separately for each class. Alternatives exist for bulk importing members of a class, but they are somewhat complicated
    and do not work for interfaces or multiple inheritance.</LI>
  <LI><B>Versions</B>. We could require package authors to mark the symbols they export with explicit versions. A package's
    developer could introduce a new version of the package with additional symbols as long as those symbols were made invisible
    to prior versions.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The last approach appears to be the most desirable because it places the smallest burden on casual users of the language,
who merely have to import the packages they use and supply the current version numbers in the import statements. A package
author has to be careful not to disturb the set of visible prior-version symbols when releasing an updated package, but authors
of dynamically linkable packages are assumed to be more sophisticated users of the language and could be supplied with tools
to automatically check updated packages' consistency.</P>

<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>The versioning system in JavaScript 2.0 only affects exports of symbols. The concept of a version does not apply to a package's
internal code; it is up to package developers to ensure that newer releases of their packages continue to behave compatibly
with older ones.</P>

<H3>Terminology</H3>

<P>A <I>version</I> describes the API of a package. A <I>release</I> refers to the entirety of a package, including its code.
One release can export many versions of its API. A package developer should make sure that multiple releases of a package
that export version <I>V</I> export exactly the same set of symbols in version <I>V</I>.</P>

<H3>Example</H3>

<P>As an example, suppose that a developer wrote a sorting package <VAR>P</VAR> with functions <CODE>sort</CODE> and <CODE>merge</CODE>
that called bubble sort in version <CODE>"1.0"</CODE>. In the next release the developer adds a function called
<CODE>stablesort</CODE> and includes it in version <CODE>"2.0"</CODE>. In a subsequent release the developer changes
the <CODE>sort</CODE> algorithm to a quicksort that calls <CODE>stablesort</CODE> as a subroutine. That last release of the
package might look like:</P>

<PRE>public version "1.0" = "";       // The = "" makes version "1.0" be the default
public version "2.0" &gt; "1.0";

public var serialNumber;

public function sort(Function compare, any[] array) any[] {...}
public function merge(Function compare, any[] array1, any[] array2) any[] {...}
public "2.0" function stablesort(Function compare, any[] array) any[] {...}</PRE>

<P>Suppose, further, that client package <VAR>C1</VAR> imports version <CODE>"1.0"</CODE> of <VAR>P</VAR>, client
package <VAR>C2</VAR> simultaneously imports version <CODE>"2.0"</CODE> of <VAR>P</VAR>, and a search for <VAR>P</VAR>
yields the latest release described above. There would be only <I>one</I> instance of <VAR>P</VAR> running -- the latest <I>release</I>.
Both clients would get the same <CODE>sort</CODE> and <CODE>merge</CODE> functions, and both would see the same <CODE>serialNumber</CODE>
variable (in particular, if client <VAR>C1</VAR> wrote to <CODE>serialNumber</CODE>, then client <VAR>C2</VAR> would see the
updated value), but only client package <VAR>C2</VAR> would see the <CODE>stablesort</CODE> function. Both clients would get
the quicksort release of <CODE>sort</CODE>. If client package <VAR>C1</VAR> defined its own <CODE>stablesort</CODE> function,
then that function would not conflict with <VAR>P</VAR>'s <CODE>stablesort</CODE>; furthermore, <VAR>P</VAR>'s <CODE>sort</CODE>
would still refer to <VAR>P</VAR>'s <CODE>stablesort</CODE> in its internal subroutine call.</P>

<P>Had only the first release of <VAR>P</VAR> been available, client package <VAR>C2</VAR> would obtain an error because version
2 of <VAR>P</VAR>'s API would not be available. Client <VAR>C1</VAR> could run normally, although the <CODE>sort</CODE> function
it calls would use bubble sort instead of the quicksort.</P>

<P>Note that the last release of <VAR>P</VAR> did not change the API so it did not need a new version. Of course, it could
define a new version if for some reason it wanted clients to be able to demand the last release of <VAR>P</VAR> even though
its API is the same as the second release.</P>

<H2><A name="version-declaration"></A>Version Declarations</H2>

<H3>Version Names</H3>

<P>A version name <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> is a quoted string literal such as <CODE>"1.2"</CODE> or
<CODE>"Private Interface 2.0"</CODE>. Two version names are equal if their strings are equal. A special version
whose name is the empty string <CODE>""</CODE> is called the <I>default version</I>.</P>

<H3>Declaration Syntax</H3>

<P>A package must declare every version it uses except <CODE>""</CODE>, which is declared by default if not explicitly
declared. A version must be declared before its first use. A given version name may be declared only once per package. A package
declares a version name <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> using the version declaration:</P>

<DIV class=grammar-rule>
  <DIV class=grammar-lhs><SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionDefinition</SPAN>&nbsp;<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_rArr)</SCRIPT></DIV>
  <DIV class=grammar-rhs>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<SPAN class=nonterminal>Visibility</SPAN>]&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>version</CODE>&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>&nbsp;[<CODE class=terminal-keyword>&gt;</CODE>&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionList</SPAN>]&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>;</CODE></DIV>
  <DIV class=grammar-rhs>|&nbsp;&nbsp;[<SPAN class=nonterminal>Visibility</SPAN>]&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>version</CODE>&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>&nbsp;[<CODE class=terminal-keyword>=</CODE>&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>]&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>;</CODE></DIV>
</DIV>
<DIV class=grammar-rule>
  <DIV class=grammar-lhs><SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionList</SPAN>&nbsp;<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_rArr)</SCRIPT></DIV>
  <DIV class=grammar-rhs>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>,</CODE>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>,</CODE>&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN></DIV>
</DIV>
<P>A version declaration cannot be nested inside a <SPAN class=nonterminal>ClassDefinition</SPAN>'s <SPAN class=nonterminal>Block</SPAN>.</P>

<P>If <SPAN class=nonterminal>Visibility</SPAN> is present, it must be either <CODE class=terminal-keyword>private</CODE>, <CODE class=terminal-keyword>package</CODE>,
or <CODE class=terminal-keyword>public</CODE> (without <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionsAndRenames</SPAN>). Unlike in other declarations,
the default is <CODE class=terminal-keyword>public</CODE>, which makes <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> accessible by
other packages. A <CODE class=terminal-keyword>private</CODE> or <CODE class=terminal-keyword>package</CODE> <SPAN class=nonterminal>Visibility</SPAN>
hides its <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> from other packages; such a <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> can be used
only by being included in the <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionList</SPAN> of another <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>. Also
unlike other declarations, all <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> declarations are global.</P>

<H3>Version Ordering</H3>

<P>If the <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> being declared is followed by a <CODE class=terminal-keyword>&gt;</CODE> and
a <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionList</SPAN>, then the <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> is said to be <I>greater</I> than
all of the <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>s in the <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionList</SPAN>. We write <VAR>v1</VAR> :&gt;
<VAR>v2</VAR> to indicate that <VAR>v1</VAR> is greater than <VAR>v2</VAR> and <VAR>v1</VAR> :<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_ge)</SCRIPT>
<VAR>v2</VAR> to indicate that either <VAR>v1</VAR> and <VAR>v2</VAR> are the same version or <VAR>v1</VAR> :&gt; <VAR>v2</VAR>.
Order is transitive, which means that if <VAR>v1</VAR> :&gt; <VAR>v2</VAR> and <VAR>v2</VAR> :&gt; <VAR>v3</VAR>, then <VAR>v1</VAR>
:&gt; <VAR>v3</VAR>. This order induces a partial order on the set of all versions. It is possible for two versions to be
unordered with respect to each other, in which case they are not equal and neither is greater than the other.</P>

<P>If the <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> <VAR>v1</VAR> being declared is followed by a <CODE class=terminal-keyword>=</CODE>
and another <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> <VAR>v2</VAR>, then <VAR>v1</VAR> becomes an alias for <VAR>v2</VAR>, and
they may be used interchangeably.</P>

<H3><A name="versionRange"></A>Version Ranges</H3>

<P>A <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionRange</SPAN> specifies a subset of all versions. This subset contains all versions that
are both greater than or equal to a given <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>1</SPAN></SPAN> and less than or
equal to a given <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>2</SPAN></SPAN>. A <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionRange</SPAN>
can have either of the following forms:</P>

<DIV class=grammar-rule>
  <DIV class=grammar-lhs><SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionRange</SPAN>&nbsp;<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_rArr)</SCRIPT></DIV>
  <DIV class=grammar-rhs>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN></DIV>
  <DIV class=grammar-rhs>|&nbsp;&nbsp;[<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>1</SPAN></SPAN>]&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>..</CODE>&nbsp;[<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>2</SPAN></SPAN>]</DIV>
</DIV>
<P>The first form specifies the one-element set {<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>}. The second form specifies the set
of all <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>s <VAR>v</VAR> such that <VAR>v</VAR> :<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_ge)</SCRIPT>
<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>1</SPAN></SPAN> and <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>2</SPAN></SPAN>
:<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_ge)</SCRIPT> <VAR>v</VAR>. If <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>1</SPAN></SPAN>
is omitted, the condition <VAR>v</VAR> :<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_ge)</SCRIPT> <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>1</SPAN></SPAN>
is dropped. If <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>2</SPAN></SPAN> is omitted, the condition <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>2</SPAN></SPAN>
:<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_ge)</SCRIPT> <VAR>v</VAR> is dropped.</P>

<DIV class=issue>

  <H2>Discussion</H2>

  <H3>Version Numbers 1</H3>

  <P>The original version of this specification allowed both strings and numbers as <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> names.
  Two version names were equal if their <CODE>toString</CODE> representations were identical, so version names <CODE>2.0</CODE>
  and <CODE>"2"</CODE> were identical but <CODE>2.0</CODE> and <CODE>"2.0"</CODE> were not. In addition, numbered versions
  had an implicit order: For any two versions <VAR>v1</VAR> and <VAR>v2</VAR> whose names could be represented as <CODE>number</CODE>s,
  <VAR>v1</VAR> :&gt; <VAR>v2</VAR> if and only if <VAR>v1</VAR> was numerically greater than <VAR>v2</VAR>. Additionally,
  every version except <CODE>0</CODE> was greater than version <CODE>0</CODE>. It was an error to define explicit version
  containment relations that would violate this default order, directly or indirectly.</P>

  <P>Numbered <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> names were dropped for simplicity and to avoid confusion with versions
  such as <CODE>1.2.3</CODE> (which would be a syntax error unless quoted).</P>

  <H3>Version Numbers 2</H3>

  <P>Another, simpler, approach is to require all <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> names to be nonnegative integers (without
  quotes). Versions would not need to be declared, and all versions would be totally ordered in numerical order. A disadvantage
  of this approach is that the total order keeps versions from being branched.</P>

  <H3>Dynamic Version Definitions</H3>

  <P>Currently version definitions are fixed. These could be turned into function calls that define versions and list their
  relationships. If we can get a variable or constant to hold a set of version names, then we could use these variables rather
  than specific version names in the <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionsAndRenames</SPAN> lists after <CODE>public</CODE> keywords.
  This would provide another level of abstraction and flexibility.</P>

  <H3>Separate Version Definitions</H3>

  <P>Yet another approach is to consolidate all of the information in <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionsAndRenames</SPAN> into
  a set of <CODE>export</CODE> statements, say, at the top of the file rather than being interspersed throughout a package
  along with <CODE>public</CODE> declarations. This would make it easier to see all of the identifiers exported by a particular
  version of the package, but it would also likely lead to inconsistencies when someone forgets to update an <CODE>export</CODE>
  statement after inserting another variable, function, field, or method definition. Such errors would likely be caught after
  a package has been released.</P>
