<H1>Introduction</H1>

<H2>Motivation</H2>

<P>As a package evolves over time it often becomes necessary to change its exported interface. Most of these changes involve
adding symbols (global and class members), although occasionally a symbol may be deleted or renamed. In a monolithic environment
where all JavaScript source code comes preassembled from the same source, this is not a problem. On the other hand, if packages
are dynamically linked from several sources then versioning problems are likely to arise.</P>

<P>One of the most common avoidable problems is collision of symbols. Unless we solve this problem, an author of a library
will not be able to add even one symbol in a future version of his library because that symbol could already be in use by
some client or some other library that a client also links with. This problem occurs both in the global namespace and in the
namespaces within classes from which clients are allowed to inherit.</P>

<P>There are several possible approaches to solving this problem:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Naming conventions</B>. We could require each symbol to be prefixed by the full name of the party from which this
    symbol originates. Unfortunately, this would get tedious and unnecessarily impact casual uses of the language. Furthermore,
    this approach is impractical for the names of methods because it is often desirable to share the same method name across
    several classes to attain polymorphism; this would not be possible if Netscape's objects all used the <CODE>com_netscape_length</CODE>
    method while MIT's objects used the <CODE>edu_mit_length</CODE> method.</LI>
  <LI><B>Explicit imports</B>. We could require each client package to import every external symbol it references. This works
    reasonably well for global symbols but becomes tedious for the names of class members, which would have to be imported
    separately for each class. Alternatives exist for bulk importing members of a class, but they are somewhat complicated
    and do not work for interfaces or multiple inheritance.</LI>
  <LI><B>Versions</B>. We could require package authors to mark the symbols they export with explicit versions. A package's
    developer could introduce a new version of the package with additional symbols as long as those symbols were made invisible
    to prior versions.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The last approach appears to be the most desirable because it places the smallest burden on casual users of the language,
who merely have to import the packages they use and supply the current version numbers in the import statements. A package
author has to be careful not to disturb the set of visible prior-version symbols when releasing an updated package, but authors
of dynamically linkable packages are assumed to be more sophisticated users of the language and could be supplied with tools
to automatically check updated packages' consistency.</P>

<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>The versioning system in JavaScript 2.0 only affects exports of symbols. The concept of a version does not apply to a package's
internal code; it is up to package developers to ensure that newer releases of their packages continue to behave compatibly
with older ones.</P>

<H3>Terminology</H3>

<P>A <I>version</I> describes the API of a package. A <I>release</I> refers to the entirety of a package, including its code.
One release can export many versions of its API. A package developer should make sure that multiple releases of a package
that export version <I>V</I> export exactly the same set of symbols in version <I>V</I>.</P>

<H3>Example</H3>

<P>As an example, suppose that a developer wrote a sorting package <VAR>P</VAR> with functions <CODE>sort</CODE> and <CODE>merge</CODE>
that called bubble sort in version 1. In the next release the developer adds a function called <CODE>stablesort</CODE> and
includes it in version 2. In a subsequent release the developer changes the <CODE>sort</CODE> algorithm to a quicksort that
calls <CODE>stablesort</CODE> as a subroutine. That last release of the package might look like:</P>

<PRE>public version 1;
public version 2 &gt; 1;

public function sort(funct compare, any[] array) any[] {...}
public function merge(funct compare, any[] array1, any[] array2) any[] {...}
public&lt;2&gt; function stablesort(funct compare, any[] array) any[] {...}</PRE>

<P>Suppose, further, that client <VAR>C1</VAR> imports version 1 of <VAR>P</VAR>, client <VAR>C2</VAR> simultaneously imports
version 2 of <VAR>P</VAR>, and a search for <VAR>P</VAR> yields the latest release described above. There would be only one
instance of <VAR>P</VAR> running -- the latest release. Both clients would get the same <CODE>sort</CODE> and <CODE>merge</CODE>
functions, but only client <VAR>C2</VAR> would see the <CODE>stablesort</CODE> function. Both clients would get the quicksort
release of <CODE>sort</CODE>. If client <VAR>C1</VAR> defined its own <CODE>stablesort</CODE> function, then that function
would not conflict with <VAR>P</VAR>'s <CODE>stablesort</CODE>; furthermore, <VAR>P</VAR>'s <CODE>sort</CODE> would still
refer to <VAR>P</VAR>'s <CODE>stablesort</CODE> in its internal subroutine call.</P>

<P>Had only the first release of <VAR>P</VAR> been available, client <VAR>C2</VAR> would obtain an error because version 2
of <VAR>P</VAR>'s API would not be available. Client <VAR>C1</VAR> could run normally, although the <CODE>sort</CODE> function
it calls would use bubble sort instead of the quicksort.</P>

<P>Note that the last release of <VAR>P</VAR> did not change the API so it did not need a new version. Of course, it could
define a new version if for some reason it wanted clients to be able to demand the last release of <VAR>P</VAR> even though
its API is the same as the second release.</P>

<H1><A name="version-declaration"></A>Version Declarations</H1>

<H2>Version Names</H2>

<P>A version name <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> is one of the following:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>A literal, nonnegative <CODE>double</CODE> number other than NaN.</LI>
  <LI>A string literal.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Two version names are said to be equal if their <CODE>toString</CODE> representations are identical, so version names <CODE>2.0</CODE>
and <CODE>"2"</CODE> are identical but <CODE>2.0</CODE> and <CODE>"2.0"</CODE> are not.</P>

<H2>Declaration Syntax</H2>

<P>A package must declare every version it uses except version <CODE>1</CODE>, which is declared by default if not explicitly
declared. A version must be declared before its first use. A given version name may be declared only once per package. A package
declares a version name <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> using the version declaration:</P>

<DIV class=grammar-rule>
  <DIV class=grammar-lhs><SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionDefinition</SPAN>&nbsp;<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_rArr)</SCRIPT></DIV>
  <DIV class=grammar-rhs>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<SPAN class=nonterminal>Visibility</SPAN>]&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>version</CODE>&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>&nbsp;[<CODE class=terminal-keyword>&gt;</CODE>&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionList</SPAN>]&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>;</CODE></DIV>
</DIV>
<DIV class=grammar-rule>
  <DIV class=grammar-lhs><SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionList</SPAN>&nbsp;<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_rArr)</SCRIPT></DIV>
  <DIV class=grammar-rhs>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>,</CODE>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>,</CODE>&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN></DIV>
</DIV>

<P>A version declaration cannot be nested inside a <SPAN class=nonterminal>ClassDefinition</SPAN>'s <SPAN class=nonterminal>Block</SPAN>.</P>

<P>If <SPAN class=nonterminal>Visibility</SPAN> is present, it must be either <CODE class=terminal-keyword>private</CODE>, <CODE class=terminal-keyword>package</CODE>,
or <CODE class=terminal-keyword>public</CODE> (without <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionsAndRenames</SPAN>). Unlike in other declarations,
the default is <CODE class=terminal-keyword>public</CODE>, which makes <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> accessible by
other packages. A <CODE class=terminal-keyword>private</CODE> or <CODE class=terminal-keyword>package</CODE> <SPAN class=nonterminal>Visibility</SPAN>
hides its <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> from other packages; such a <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> can be used
only by being included in the <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionList</SPAN> of another <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>. Also
unlike other declarations, all <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> declarations are global.</P>

<H2>Version Ordering</H2>

<P>If the <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> being declared is followed by a <CODE class=terminal-keyword>&gt;</CODE> and
a <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionList</SPAN>, then the <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN> is said to be <I>greater</I> than
all of the <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>s in the <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionList</SPAN>. We write <VAR>v1</VAR> :&gt;
<VAR>v2</VAR> to indicate that <VAR>v1</VAR> is greater than <VAR>v2</VAR> and <VAR>v1</VAR> :<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_ge)</SCRIPT>
<VAR>v2</VAR> to indicate that either <VAR>v1</VAR> and <VAR>v2</VAR> are the same version or <VAR>v1</VAR> :&gt; <VAR>v2</VAR>.
Order is transitive, which means that if <VAR>v1</VAR> :&gt; <VAR>v2</VAR> and <VAR>v2</VAR> :&gt; <VAR>v3</VAR>, then <VAR>v1</VAR>
:&gt; <VAR>v3</VAR>. This order induces a partial order on the set of all versions. It is possible for two versions to be
unordered with respect to each other, in which case they are not equal and neither is greater than the other.</P>

<P>Order is predefined for versions whose names can be represented as <CODE>double</CODE> numbers. For such versions <VAR>v1</VAR>
and <VAR>v2</VAR>, <VAR>v1</VAR> :&gt; <VAR>v2</VAR> if and only if <VAR>v1</VAR> is numerically greater than <VAR>v2</VAR>.
Additionally, every version except <CODE>0</CODE> is greater than version <CODE>0</CODE>. It is an error to define explicit
version containment relations that would violate this default order, directly or indirectly.</P>

<H2><A name="versionRange"></A>Version Ranges</H2>

<P>A <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionRange</SPAN> specifies a subset of all versions. This subset contains all versions that
are both greater than or equal to a given <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>1</SPAN></SPAN> and less than or
equal to a given <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>2</SPAN></SPAN>. A <SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionRange</SPAN>
can have either of the following forms:</P>

<DIV class=grammar-rule>
  <DIV class=grammar-lhs><SPAN class=nonterminal>VersionRange</SPAN>&nbsp;<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_rArr)</SCRIPT></DIV>
  <DIV class=grammar-rhs>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN></DIV>
  <DIV class=grammar-rhs>|&nbsp;&nbsp;[<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>1</SPAN></SPAN>]&nbsp;<CODE class=terminal-keyword>..</CODE>&nbsp;[<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>2</SPAN></SPAN>]</DIV>
</DIV>

<P>The first form specifies the one-element set {<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>}.</P>

<P>The second form specifies the set of all <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version</SPAN>s <VAR>v</VAR> such that <VAR>v</VAR> :<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_ge)</SCRIPT>
<SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>1</SPAN></SPAN> and <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>2</SPAN></SPAN>
:<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_ge)</SCRIPT> <VAR>v</VAR>. If <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>1</SPAN></SPAN>
is omitted, <CODE>0</CODE> is assumed. If <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>2</SPAN></SPAN> is omitted, the
condition <SPAN class=nonterminal>Version<SPAN style=sub-num>2</SPAN></SPAN> :<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">document.write(U_ge)</SCRIPT>
<VAR>v</VAR> is dropped.</P>
