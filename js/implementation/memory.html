  JS Values</H3>
<P>The new scheme for encoding JS values differs little from that used in SpiderMonkey: 
  The JS <tt>true</tt>, <tt>false</tt>, <tt>null</tt> (and <tt>undefined</tt> 
  ?) constants will have distinguished tagged values.&nbsp; As before, FP numbers, 
  strings and objects are represented using pointers into the garbage-collected 
  JS heap.&nbsp; There was some discussion as to whether small integer values 
  would benefit from being heap-allocated also.&nbsp; (Perl, for example, implements 
  integers as heap-allocated objects and caches conversions from integers to strings 
  and vice-versa in the object.)&nbsp; However, we'll probably begin by using 
  the current SpiderMonkey scheme of encoding small integers as scalars.</P>
<H3> JS Objects</H3>

<P>Unlike SpiderMonkey, objects in the JS heap can be of variable length. Objects 
  will not be relocatable since this adds a lot of complexity to interactions 
  with host objects and makes it more difficult to debug.&nbsp; Waldemar thinks 
  memory management can be done efficiently, at least for objects that make use 
  of the JS memory manager, by making use of a first-fit allocator that can perform 
  allocations and deallocation/coalescing in constant time. </P>
<P>Objects must be aligned on 8-byte boundaries, so as to allow aligned 64-bit 
  floating-point values within the object.&nbsp; All heap-allocated blocks share 
  this common prefix:</P>

  Object Header</H4>
<P>The header word contains fields used for garbage collection, memory management 
  and locking. The exact contents of the header word are not yet decided. If it 
  turns out that the object header can be made small, say a byte, we can consider 
  how to pack them together for space efficiency, i.e. so that objects and headers 
  are not contiguous. These are some of the pieces of data that might be present 
  in the header:</P>
<UL>
  <LI> GC 
    <UL>
      <LI>Marked [1 bit] (If concurrent GC is performed, then two bits will likely 
        be necessary to allow for white/black/gray marking.)</LI>
      <LI>Weakly reachable flag ?&nbsp; [1 bit] (No consensus as to whether support 
        for weak references was useful enough to warrant inclusion.)</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI> Memory management 
    <UL>
      <LI> Length of object (but only if there's unused bits in the header, otherwise 
        we'll have an ObjectLength() virtual method which an object uses to report 
        its length)</LI>
      <LI>Flag to indicate if block is free [1 bit]</LI>
      <LI>Flag to indicate if preceding block is free [1 bit]</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI>Locking
    <UL>
      <LI>There was no agreement as to whether high-performance reentrant per-object 
        locks were necessary. If reentrant locking is a possibility, then efficient 
        locking may require a field that is roughly pointer-sized. Otherwise, 
        a single-bit semaphore should be sufficient. In order to make progress 
        on this decision, we need to specify the semantics of multithreaded JS, 
        both with respect to the language semantics and to its implementation.</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
</UL>
<H4>Object interfaces</H4>
<P>The second word of each object contains a pointer to the vtable of a C++ object.&nbsp; 
  All collectible objects must implement the nsIGCAble XPCOM interface. In addition, 
  these objects may implement other XPCOM interfaces.&nbsp; Here's a first cut 
  at what the interface inheritance hierarchy might look like for those interfaces 
  that are related to the JS engine:<br>

<blockquote>&nbsp; </blockquote>
<P>The nsIGCAble interface contains two methods: one for determining the size 
  of an object (so that it need not be stored in the header of every object) and 
  one for marking other reachable objects.&nbsp; (There is no method in nsIGCAble 
  for finalizing an object - that will be done when nsISupport's Release() method 
  is called.)&nbsp;&nbsp; nsIScriptable is roughly analogous to Rhino's Scriptable 
  interface; It will contain methods for manipulating object properties, i.e. 
  get, set, delete, add and lookup operations. nsIScriptFunction is comparable 
  to Rhino's Function interface; It adds methods for invoking a function or constructor. 
  It's possible that we'll have two more JS interfaces, nsINativeScriptable and 
  nsINativeFunction, which will extend nsIScriptable and nsIFunction respectively, 
  adding methods that are only applicable to builtin and native JS objects.<br>
</P>
<H4>More on nsIGCAble</H4>
<P>The JS runtime and its universe of objects collectively hold a single reference 
  to every reachable JS object in the collectible heap. When an object becomes 
  unreachable, as determined by garbage collection, the nsISupport's Release() 
  method is invoked.</P>
<P>The JS runtime itself never calls nsISupport's AddRef() method since the initial 
  reference is implicit with the object's creation. However, it's possible for 
  external code to call AddRef() on a JS object, so every JS object must support 
  a reference count. However, the overhead of a full refcount word on a JS object 
  is a cost that we would rather avoid. One possibility is to store small refcounts 
  in the object header and larger ones in a global hash table that is indexed 
  by object address.</P>
<H4>Host Objects</H4>
<P>JS host objects are represented no differently than native objects, i.e. they 
  are XPCOM objects that implement the nsIScriptable or nsIFunction interfaces. 
  The JS engine will expose its memory allocator API so that 3rd-party implementors 
  can create new JS objects in the collectible heap.</P>
<P> Most XPCOM objects, however, will want to use their own memory allocator. 
  To represent these host objects, a proxy JS object is created in the JS heap 
  with a reference to the host object that it wraps:</P>
