<h1>
Simple Packages in JavaScript</h1>
<font size=-1><a href="mailto:nboyd@atg.com">Norris Boyd</a></font>
<p>
<hr>
<br>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Why "simple" packages?</font></font></b>
<p>There are a large number of proposals on the table for the next version
of the ECMA standard. Among these are ideas for packages, classes, and
static types. Using these features should allow JavaScript programmers
to write larger programs in a way that is robust and maintainable.
<p>However, the question arises: Is it possible to define a simple packages
feature that will provide a large amount of utility to JavaScript programmers
in the short term? I believe so. This document describes a small set of
additional features for JavaScript that provide for many of the modularity
benefits that we expect from the eventual complete packages design.
<br>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Defining a package</font></font></b>
<p>A package is defined using a <i>PackageDeclaration</i> at the start,
followed by normal JavaScript source (with a few restrictions detailed
below). The <i>PackageDeclaration</i> has the following syntax:
<dir>
<dir><i>PackageDeclaration</i> ::= <tt>package</tt> <i>Identifier</i> <tt>;</tt></dir>
</dir>
The <i>Identifier</i> is the package name. The trailing semicolon is <i>not</i>
optional; that way, syntax extensions can be added more easily.
<p>The syntax of function definitions would be broadened to include a public
attribute that will be used to indicate which functions may be accessed
by importers of the package.
<p>So a simple, complete package definition might look like
<dir>
<dir>
<pre><tt>package pkg;
public function increment(x) { return x+1; }</tt></pre>
</dir>
</dir>
This defines a package named <i>pkg</i> and a single public function named
<i>increment</i>.
<p>Packages can only contain function and variable declarations (and no
variable initialization). This heavy restriction allows us to dodge the
potential for problems of timing the execution of global code.
<br>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Using a package</font></font></b>
<p>To use a package, just begin the script with an import declaration.
The syntax of the import declaration is
<dir>
<dir><i>ImportDeclaration</i> ::= <tt>import</tt> <i>DottedList</i> <tt>from
</tt><i>URI</i><tt>;</tt>
<p><i>DottedList</i> ::= <i>Identifier</i>
<p>| <i>DottedList</i> <tt>.</tt> <i>Identifier</i></dir>
</dir>
Again, the semicolon is not optional to allow for additional syntax to
be added later. <i>URI</i> is a quoted string containing a Uniform Resource
Identifier. We may also want to allow special unquoted identifiers in place
of <i>URI</i>, like <tt>system</tt>, that would indicate that the package
is to be loaded from a special standard place that the embedding knows
about. We could do the File and Internationalization packages using this
mechanism. (E.g., "classpath:com.netscape.examples.File".)
<p>When an import declaration is encountered, the engine first checks to
see if it has already loaded the package. If so, it can just import the
names from that package. Otherwise, it locates the source of the package,
creates a new object to use as the top-level object for the package, and
executes the source of the package. Since the package is restricted from
having top-level code, executing the source will merely initialize the
package's top-level object with all the top-level functions and variables.
It also creates a list of all the public functions in the package.
<p>If <i>DottedList</i> ends with the package name, then all public names
are imported into the top-level object of the importing script. Otherwise,
<i>DottedList</i>
must end with a package name followed by the name of a public function
in the package, and just that name is imported. In either case, if any
name being imported is already used for a function or variable, an error
is reported. When the name is imported, a read-only, permanent property
of the importer's top-level object is created and initialized with a closure
of the associated function object in the package's top-level object. <i>Issue:
is the closure really needed?</i>
<p>When an imported function is called, the closure in turn calls the function
object in the package's top-level object. The scope chain thus consists
of the activation object of the function followed by the top-level object
of the package. This means that any global objects other than public functions
will be visible to functions inside the package but cannot be seen by functions
outside the package unless returned from function calls.
<br>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Standard objects</font></font></b>
<p>ECMA defines several standard objects and functions (<tt>Function</tt>,
<tt>isNaN</tt>,
<tt>Date.prototype</tt>,
etc.) that are properties of the top-level object or are reachable from
the top-level. The requirement of separate namespaces for packages in turn
leads to the requirement for several "global" objects in the ECMA sense,
which are now called "top-level" objects since they are now no longer global.
(This situation has existed forever in the browser embedding, where each
window object is a top-level object.)
<p>However, now that we have language constructs that result in several
top-level objects, we now need to rationalize the behavior of these standard
objects so that they can be shared across multiple top-level objects. The
only other option is to have multiple copies of the global objects for
each top-level scope. But then we run into the series of problems that
Mike McCabe was unable to work around in his implementation of errors as
exceptions in order to make <font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>instanceof</font></font>and
equality work as expected. Also, if scripts begin to make heavy use of
the package mechanism, then we'll have a large number of duplicate copies
of the built-in objects consuming the memory resources of the system. In
fact, by defining packages as a global repository of code and state we
fix the problem that plagues people trying to write JavaScript applications
with multiple pages: where to put the shared functionality and state across
multiple windows.
<p>I believe, therefore, that we need to define the standard objects as
being sealed with all properties ReadOnly. By "sealed" I mean that all
properties are DontDelete and it is not possible to add additional properties.
Would this impose a burden on existing scripts? We could come up with some
way to impose this restriction selectively through versioning or by detecting
the presence of import or package declarations. However, I believe this
approach could be problematic (what if some scripts on the page are "old-style"
and others are "new-style": we can't substitute out the global objects).
We could also make the change more globally. I've already implemented this
restriction on a private copy of 4.5 and haven't been able to find any
sites that depend on this behavior.
<br>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Example session</font></font></b>
<p>The following sessions were run against a version of our Java version
of our JavaScript engine (which we can't publish yet, unfortunately) in
which I've made changes for simple packages. The implementation is not
complete; in particular, error handling is often not implemented.
<p>I've implemented a single set of standard objects that are shared across
all packages. These standard objects are sealed and have readonly properties.
<dir>
<pre>E:\src\ns\js\rhino> cat pkg.js
package pkg;

var count = 0;

public function incr() { return g(); }

function g() { return count++; }

public function getDate() { return new Date(); }</pre>
</dir>
This JavaScript file defines a package pkg with two public functions, <tt>incr</tt>
and <tt>getDate</tt>.
<dir>
<pre>E:\src\ns\js\rhino> rhino
js import pkg.incr from "file:///E:/src/ns/js/rhino/pkg.js";
js incr()
0
js incr()
1
js typeof getDate
undefined
js typeof g
undefined
js quit()</pre>
</dir>
Here we import a single function from the package and call it. Note that
none of the other functions have been imported.
<dir>
<pre>E:\src\ns\js\rhino> rhino
js import pkg from "file:///E:/src/ns/js/rhino/pkg.js";
js incr()
0
js incr()
1
js typeof getDate
function
js typeof g
undefined
js var d = getDate()
js d
Tue Jan 26 15:05:26 GMT-0800 (PST) 1999
js d instanceof Date
true
js quit()</pre>
</dir>
Now we import the entire package. Both <tt>incr</tt> and <tt>getDate</tt>
are available, but <tt>g</tt> is not. Note that since we're sharing standard
objects, the instanceof check functions as you would expect.
<blockquote>
<pre>E:\src\ns\js\rhino> jsc pkg.js

E:\src\ns\js\rhino> rhino
js import pkg from "classpath:pkg";
js incr()
0
js incr()
1
js typeof g
undefined
js typeof getDate
function
js getDate() instanceof Date
true
js quit()</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><br>Now we compile the package into a Java class and import the class.
Here's an example of a non-URI form of the <tt>from</tt> clause. There's
nothing special about the generated Java class except that it implements
the Script interface, so it would also be possible to write a Java class
and make it appear as a JavaScript package. I would expect that XPConnect
objects could be loaded in a similar way.
<dir>
<pre>E:\src\ns\js\rhino> rhino
js String.x = 87
js: Cannot add a property to a sealed object.
js String.prototype.x = 879
js: Cannot add a property to a sealed object.
js String.prototype.substring.x = 8374
js: Cannot add a property to a sealed object.
js String.prototype = 7
7
js String.prototype

js String.prototype.substring = 88
88
js String.prototype.substring
function substring() {
[native code]
}

js quit()</pre>
</dir>
Here we show that the standard objects are sealed and have readonly properties.
<br>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Possible extensions</font></font></b>
<p>Several possible extensions come to mind to augment the simple scheme
outlined above.
<p><b>Versioning</b>
<p>It would be easy to add support for versioning by allowing multiple
version names to be defined and then importing only the names corresponding
to the appropriate version. Additional lookups could be performed as they
are today, and then when classes are available, the special versioned member
lookup could be added. Dynamic properties could continue to be looked up
without regard to version. Otherwise, you'd have to specify a version corresponding
to the dynamic property when you created it, which would mean that you'd
have to declare the dynamic property in some way, which would mean that
it is no longer dynamic.
<p><b>Top-level renaming</b>
<p>I initially implemented top-level renaming so that name conflicts could
be resolved at import time. However, Waldemar Howat pointed out that top-level
renaming makes top-level scripts less like classes, so I've disabled the
feature. Currently there's no way to resolve name conflicts. We could also
add some object that works like LiveConnect's Packages object so that it
is possible to walk down into the exported properties of a package. However,
Waldemar has pointed out that he's considering some possibly different
syntax that is an analog to the <tt>::</tt> operator in C++ to perform
this sort of operation.
<p><b>Top-level scripts</b>
<p>Currently top-level scripts of packages are executed when the import
declaration is processed. However, I've made no attempt to deal with possible
cycles in a package loading graph and, as stated above, think the simplest
thing would be to disallow top-level scripts. One possible extension would
be to define top-level scripts as executing when the first function is
called, but this doesn't appear to have a good migration path to classes.
<br><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Acknowlegements</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1></font></font></b>
<p>Brendan Eich's original design of import/export in JavaScript 1.2 had
the idea of names imported from multiple global objects.
<br>Waldemar Horwat's ideas on language futures are the inspiration for
versioning and the syntax, and has given good feedback on what <i>not</i>
to do.
