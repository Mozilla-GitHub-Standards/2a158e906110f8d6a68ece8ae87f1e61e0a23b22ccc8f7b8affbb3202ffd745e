<div align="Left"><b>Introduction:</b><br>
nsIAccessible interface is similar to IAccessible interface of MSAA. nsIAccessible
interface has some additional advantages over IAccessible. nsIAccessible
is cross platform and is more robust. nsIAccessible has the capability of
supporting other new accessibility API's such as Sun's Gnome Accessibility
API. nsIAccessible interface is implemented by a variety of classes for each
of the various objects in HTML and XUL. Each class is tailored to the specific
abilities and properties of the HTML and XUL objects it applies to.
<p><b>Features Tested:</b><br>
nsIAccessible interface has several State Flags, Roles, Attributes and Methods.
For now we are primarily interested in attributes <b>accName, accRole, accState,
accValue, accFocused, accNumActions </b>and methods<b> acccTakeFocus(), getAccActionName()
</b>and<b> accDoAction().</b><br>
<b>accName </b>returns the "name" of the accessible node, for example the
name of the button, check box or menu item. <br>
<b>accRole </b>returns a value representing what this accessible node is
used for, for example, is it a link, static text, editable text, a check box,
etc. <br>
<b>accState </b>returns a value representing possible on/off states, such
as focused, focussable, selected, selectable, etc. <br>
<b>accValue </b>returns the "value" of the accessible node, such as URL for
a link, the text a user entered in a field. <br>
<b>accFocused</b> returns the accessible node which is currently focused.
<br>
<b>accNumActions </b>returns the number of actions that can be performed on
the accessible node. <br>
<b>accTakeFocus</b> method is used to get focus on to specified accessible
node. <br>
<b>getAccActionName </b>method returns the name of the action when you supply
to it the action value. Eg. for buttons it returns "Press". <br>
<b>accDoAction </b>performs the action specified on the accessible node.
Eg. presses button for button node. </p>
<b>Approach:</b><br>
The test cases are written in JavaScript embedded in HTML and XUL for HTML
and XUL Elements respectively.<br>
