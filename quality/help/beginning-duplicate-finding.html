<h1>How to find previously reported bugs</h1>

<p class="author">By <a href="mailto:sidr@albedo.net?subject=how%20to%20find%20previously%20reported%20bugs%20doc"><strong>Sean Richardson</strong></a></p>

<p>The Mozilla developers want to hear about every specific and reproducible
bug that happens when you use Mozilla, but it does not help to have the same 
bug reported many times. You can help to get more bugs fixed faster by checking 
the Bugzilla database before submitting your bug report, and not creating a 
duplicate report if the bug you found has been reported already.
</p>

<p>If the bug seems obnoxious or obvious, or if you found it right away,
or if you found it on a popular site, try looking at the
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/duplicates.cgi">Most Frequently Reported Bugs list</a>
first, to see if it jumps out at you. If it is a problem with basic 
functionality and you are using a nightly binary check the 
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?resolution=---&amp;bug_severity=blocker&amp;keywords=smoketest">Smoketest Blockers</a>
to see if the problem is already known.
</p>

<p>
If you find that the problem you identified has already been reported, do 
not report it again, but if you have something useful to contribute, please 
do add a comment to the existing report.
</p>

<h3>Doing the Query</h3>

  <p>The <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/query.cgi">Bugzilla 
  Query Form</a> looks dauntingly complex - it <em>is</em> complex and 
  powerful&#8212;but you can safely ignore most of the form. Any part
  of the form that is left blank does not limit the search 
  at all, and each part that is filled in cuts the list of bugs down to only 
  those that match the criteria you set.</p>


  <p>The <strong>Status</strong> field is set by default to find NEW, 
  ASSIGNED, and REOPENED bugs&#8212;the unfixed bugs. 
  But if you're using a milestone build, you should add RESOLVED and maybe 
  VERIFIED (use Ctrl-click on MS-Windows, Command-click on MacOS), 
  especially if the milestone is a few weeks old, since many bugs will have 
  been fixed since your build was released.</p>
  
  <p>In the <strong>Product</strong> field, you should use:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Browser</strong>: If you are submitting a bug you found 
    using the Mozilla 1.x browser, when composing an HTML 
    page, or when basic browsing functionalities are not working (e.g. a 
    website isn't displayed correctly, or downloading does not work),
    you should choose this product.
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Firefox</strong>: If you are using the Mozilla Firefox 
    browser and something in the user interface isn't working correctly 
    (e.g. a checkbox isn't working in the options dialog, or bookmarks can't 
    be deleted) you should choose this product. If basic browsing 
    functionalities like displaying a website do not work, the problem is 
    most likely located in the backend code, so the Browser-product should 
    be chosen.
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Mailnews</strong>: If you have found a bug using the Mozilla 
    1.x mail and news program or when basic mail/news functionalities
    are not working (e.g. You can't send mail, or you can't delete mail on 
    your IMAP server), you should use this 
    product.
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Thunderbird</strong>: If you are using the Mozilla 
    Thunderbird mail/news program and something in the user interface is 
    not working correctly (e.g. you can't compose a mail, or a checkbox isn't 
    working in the options dialog) you should choose this product. If basic mail/news
    functionalities like connecting to an IMAP server or downloading 
    a binary attachment do not work, the problem is most likely located 
    in the backend code, so the Mailnews-product should be chosen.
    </li>
    
    <li>Most of the other items on this list will not apply if you are 
    using the Mozilla Application or Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla 
    Thunderbird. This will help focus the search.
    </li>
  </ul>


  <p>Enter a word or short phrase that identifies the problem you saw as
  uniquely as possible in the <strong>Summary</strong> field. Examples: 
  <strong>view source, auto proxy, drag drop, png image</strong>. If you 
  enter more than one word and they are not a phrase, change the type of 
  matching for the Summary field from <kbd>contains the string</kbd>
  to <kbd>contains all of the words/strings</kbd> or
  <kbd>contains any of the words/strings</kbd>, as appropriate
  (just to the left of the text-entry field).</p>

  <p>Don't use the <strong>Keywords</strong> field without first clicking 
  on the word <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi">Keywords</a>:
  you can't type just anything in there. If you try to use this for keywords 
  that are not on the list, it won't work, but some of the defined keywords 
  may be useful to narrow down your search.</p>

  <p>When you have done all that, click on the <strong>[Search]</strong> 
  button. A new page will load, and on it you should see a list of bugs 
  that match your query.</p>

<h3>Looking Over the List</h3>

  <p>The "Bug List" page, by default, is ordered by priority and severity 
  of bugs, so major problems and crashes <em>should</em> be at the top, and 
  minor	problems and enhancement requests at the bottom.</p>

  <p>If you don't get a list, and get "Zarro Boogs found" (Zero Bugs) 
  instead, look at the next section. If you get a very long list, look 
  under	<strong>Hey, not so many!</strong>, below. If the results of your 
  query are totally unexpected, the 
  <a href="../../bugs/text-searching.html">Text Searching 
  in Bugzilla</a> tutorial may help you create a better query.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, look for summaries that seem suggestive of the problem 
  you have seen. Sometimes the bug that reports the problem you found will 
  be obvious. Other times the only way to check will be looking at some of 
  the bugs on the list. If nothing on the list looks relevant, try the 
  strategies described in points 1 and 2 (and possibly 3) of the next 
  section.</p>

<h3>No Obvious Match</h3>

  <p>If you don't find a bug report that describes the same problem you 
  found immediately, it might be a new bug, but there are other reasons 
  that you might not find a match right away:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>The bug has already been reported and is in the database, 
    but the search you used didn't find it.</strong> If the bug you found 
    is obnoxious, you stumbled across it right away, and find it 
    everywhere you go, there probably <em>is</em> a report already, so 
    it's probably worth trying at least one more search.

    <ul>
      <li>You can go back and search in another way, using a synonym or
      another word entirely.
      </li>

      <li>If that doesn't help, try putting your search word or phrase in 
      the <strong>Description entry</strong> field instead. Or try 
      changing the type of matching for the Summary or Description fields 
      from &quot;case-insensitive substring&quot; to &quot;all words&quot;, 
      &quot;any words&quot;, or 
      &quot;<a href="../../bugs/text-searching.html#regex">regular expression</a>&quot;.
      </li>

      <li>You should use as short a word form as practical when using the 
      (default)	&quot;case-insensitive substring&quot; matching type - for 
      example &quot;wheel&quot; will find all of the bugs findable with 
      &quot;wheel mouse&quot; &quot;wheelmouse&quot;, &quot;mousewheel&quot; 
      <em>and</em> &quot;mouse wheel&quot; - although, as you may guess, 
      this might also find bugs that have nothing to do with mice.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>You mistyped something on the search form.</strong> Typos 
    can happen to anyone: if you can't believe you got no hits, go back 
    and look at your typing.
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>The bug is already fixed.</strong> If it has been more than 
    a few days since the version of Mozilla you found the bug with has been 
    released, especially if it is a Milestone release, and especially if 
    the bug is obnoxious, easy to find, and/or wasn't there earlier, it is 
    more likely to get immediate attention. You can try going back to the 
    query page, and in the upper-left corner, under <strong>Status</strong>, 
    and add RESOLVED and VERIFIED to include the bugs that have been fixed 
    (use Ctrl-click on MS-Windows, Command-click on MacOS).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>If you've checked and are pretty sure that the bug has not been 
  reported already. Or if you don't want to take a chance on it not getting 
  reported, skip to the <strong>My Bug Looks New</strong> section below.
  </p>

<h3>Hey, Not so Many!</h3>

  <p>If the bug list you get is too long or too diverse, it is best to try 
  again with different or additional search words, or use the &quot;all 
  words&quot;, or &quot;regular expression&quot; matching type to focus the 
  results. The <a href="../../bugs/text-searching.html">Text 
  searching in Bugzilla</a> tutorial describes what each matching type is 
  best for, and has an introduction to using regular expressions for 
  searching.</p>

  <p>If the bug list you get is long, but not scattered, there are a few 
  things you can do to make it more manageable.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you find one that has a similar issue, look at what Component 
    that bug report is filed against (on the right, near the top), go 
    back to the query page, and select that component from the list under 
    <strong>Components</strong>. You can also click on that label to see 
    descriptions of each component to try to find the appropriate one. 
    Alternatively, you can use the 
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Change Columns</span> link at the 
    bottom of the Bug List page to add the "Components" column, and sort 
    by that).
    </li>

    <li>Look near the top for crashes and hangs (Mozilla stops responding), 
    in the middle of the list for most bugs, and near the bottom for minor
    problems and enhancements.
    </li>

    <li>Look at a few of the bugs on the list anyway to try to get a 
    better idea of the type of language used in existing bug reports, 
    then try a more specific search word or phrase.
    </li>

    <li>If you can think of a second word that characterizes the problem, 
    try doing a search on the Bug List page to find the bugs whose 
    summaries also include that word (use Search&gt;Find in this Page or 
    Edit&gt;Find in Page).
    </li>

    <li>Try sorting the list: each of the headings can be clicked on to 
    sort the list by that field.
    </li>

    <li>If you are absolutely sure that this bug could only apply to a 
    certain platform and/or operating system, you can limit the search 
    by using the appropriate fields on the first row.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3>It Looks Like a Match</h3>

  <p>If you find a bug that appears to be about the same problem that 
  you saw, please read it through to be sure. If it is a match, please 
  <em>do not</em> submit a new bug report; instead add to the existing 
  report if you have anything new to contribute. You may wish to add a 
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=voting.html">vote</a> to that 
  bug if you think it is important. Thank you for saving the developers 
  the time needed to identify another duplicate report.</p>

  <p>If you have a detail to add, or if you are using a different 
  platform than is mentioned to date in the report, or if you can 
  confirm the problem and more than a month has gone by since the 
  latest comment, you can type a comment into the <strong>Additional 
  Comments</strong> field. Please look over what you add before clicking 
  on the <strong>[Commit]</strong> button.</p>

  <p>If you included RESOLVED and VERIFIED status bugs in your search, 
  you might actually find that your bug matches one that has a 
  <strong>Resolution</strong> of DUPLICATE. If that happens, please 
  follow the link at the bottom of the comments that looks like 
  &quot;This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 00000&quot; 
  and add your comments there.</p>

<h3>My Bug Looks New</h3>

  <p>If you do not find a bug that appears to be about the problem you 
  saw, go ahead and submit a bug report. Please, though, be sure to 
  report the Build ID of the Mozilla that you used, specific steps to 
  reproduce the problem, and describe both what happened and what should 
  have happened. Use 
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=guided">Bugzilla</a> 
  to file bugs, following the <a href="../bug-writing-guidelines.html">Bug 
  Writing Guidelines</a> to help you include the information that is needed.</p>

  <p>Put in as much relevant detail as you can (if you're not sure 
  about the relevancy, include the detail). Be as specific as possible.
  Please make sure that you can reproduce the bug before reporting it.</p>

  <p>Please do not mention multiple problems in one bug report; if you 
  have seen more than one problem, keep each one distinct and separate, 
  filing another report if necessary. Please look over your writing 
  before clicking on the <strong>[Commit]</strong> button.</p>
