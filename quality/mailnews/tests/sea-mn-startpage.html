  <h1>Feature Test Spec: Mail and News Component</h1>

  <h2>Mail and News Component: Start Page</h2>

  <address class="author">
    Written by Peter Mock<br>
    Updated by <a href="mailto:esther@netscape.com">Esther Goes</a>
  </address>

  <h3>References</h3>

  <p>UI Specification:</p>

  <h3>Description</h3>

  <p>Started in Communicator 4.5, when you launched Messenger the start
  page automated loaded in the message pane. This page linked to Netscape
  netcenter portal pointing to available services. The idea was instead of
  leaving the message pane blank, we could show the user some useful
  content by loading a web page into that window. As soon as the user
  selected a message in any way, the start page would be replaced by a
  normal message. The feature was available only on Win32 platforms but is
  now available on all platforms. The public mozilla and commercial build
  will point to different start pages. The mozilla start page is to be
  determine by the net community. The commercial build will point to
  netcenter services.</p>

  <h3>Start Page Preference Setting</h3>

  <p>Goal: Verify what are the default preference for the start page. The
  start page setting can be changed through the individual user preference
  or directly through the netscape preference file "prefs.js".</p>

  <ol class="uppCase">
    <li>Verify if the preference setting is not the same as the 4.5 start
    page preference for public mozilla build.

      <ol>
        <li>View the mailnews-ns.js to verify the
        <code>user_pref("mailnews.start_page.url",
        "http://www.mozilla.org");</code></li>

        <li>View the prefs.js file to verify the
        <code>user_pref("mailnews.start_page.url",
        "http://www.mozilla.org");</code></li>

        <li>View the prefs.js file to verify the start page
        <code>user_pref("mailnews.start_page.enabled", true);</code></li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>User preference dialog

      <ol>
        <li>Verify there is a user interface preference.

          <ol class="lowCase">
            <li>Verify the interface has a check box to enable/disable the
            feature.</li>

            <li>Verify the interface has a location field to enter in your
            URL".</li>

            <li>Verify the interface has a "Use Current Page" button.</li>

            <li>Verify the interface has a "Select File".</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Verify whether this preference is per profile.</li>

        <li>Verify the text wording of the user preference.</li>

        <li>Verify you can change the default web page.

          <ol class="lowCase">
            <li>Verify you can manually type in a new url into the location
            field.</li>

            <li>Verify you can use the "Use Current Page" button to change
            the default page to the current page displayed in the browser
            window.</li>

            <li>Verify you can use the "Select File" button to select a
            local web page.</li>

            <li>Verify you can leave the location field blank.</li>

            <li>Verify you can have an incorrect url.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Verify the preference is enabled by default.</li>

        <li>Verify this option can be changed and the setting is persistent
        after the dialog is closed.</li>

        <li>Verify the preference takes effect immediately without needing
        to restart.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Start Page Loading</h3>

  <p>These tests should be performed under IMAP (mail server), POP (mail
  server), and NNTP (news server).</p>

  <ol class="uppCase">
    <li>Verify that when the Mail Start Page is loading, the Stop button is
    enabled and the netscape logo icon indicates progress.</li>

    <li>Verify the start page is dismissed when the user starts views a
    mail message. (other cases TBD).</li>

    <li>Single click on another mail folder but do not select a message.
    Verify that the mail start page is still loaded.</li>

    <li>Single click on a mail or news server icon/name. Verify that the
    mail start page is still loaded.</li>

    <li>First time the 3 pane mail window is opened. Verify the start page
    loads when:

      <ol>
        <li>The first time messenger is started and the message pane is
        open.</li>

        <li>Verify the Start Page loads only once</li>

        <li>Verify that launching Communicator into both the browser (with
        a home page being loaded to different url) and Messenger will
        display the mail start page.</li>

        <li>Start messenger from the command line option. (e.g. mozilla
        -mail. The mac will have its own icon to launch directly into
        Messenger.)</li>

        <li>Start Communicator (to the browser window) then select a
        bookmark mail message. A separate message window should open. Open
        the 3 pane mail window then verify the start page does load.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>In the message pane, verify all the content menu items are
    grayed.</li>

    <li>Verify that you can not bookmark the start page.</li>

    <li>Different 3 pane mail window configurations

      <ol>
        <li>Once the start page has been loaded.

          <ol class="lowCase">
            <li>Collapse and expand the folder pane. Verify the start page
            is still loaded.</li>

            <li>Collapse and expand the message pane. Verify the start page
            is still loaded.</li>

            <li>Minimize the messenger window then restore. Verify the
            start page is still loaded.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Verify the 3 pane mail window configurations work for first
        time the 3 pane mail window is opened. (by default, all panes are
        expanded.)</li>

        <li>Set your 3 pane mail window to collapse the folder pane so that
        only the thread pane and the message pane are displayed. Exit and
        restart Communicator. Open the mail window (now 2 pane) for the
        first time. Verify the mail start page will be loaded.</li>

        <li>Verify if the message pane has been collapsed that the start
        page appears when it has been expanded</li>

        <li>Load the URL for the start page in the browser window then open
        the Messenger. Verify the start page loads</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>IMAP specific tests - verify that the mail start page loads and no
    conflicts occur with other operations that may be occurring at the same
    time.

      <ol>
        <li>Open messenger. The password dialog appears but the start page
        does not load until the password dialog is dismissed after you
        enter your password or you cancel the dialog.</li>

        <li>Open messenger and log into mail and verify the IMAP headers
        downloads.</li>

        <li>Verify the Start Page loads connecting to a Messenger 4.x
        server</li>

        <li>Verify the Start Page loads connecting to a Messenger 3.x
        server</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>POP specific tests - verify that the mail start page loads and no
    conflicts occur with other operations that may be occurring at the same
    time.

      <ol>
        <li>No summary file for inbox file</li>

        <li>Open a mail folder that has a large summary file. Verify that
        the start page doesn't start loading until the summary file is done
        loading.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>News specific tests - verify that the mail start page loads and no
    conflicts occur with other operations that may be occurring at the same
    time.

      <ol>
        <li>Subscribe to a new newsgroup that you have not viewed before.
        Verify the newsgroup headers still download.

          <ol class="lowCase">
            <li>Open a newsgroup that had more than the allocated number of
            headers to download so that the dialog prompt appears.</li>

            <li>Open a newsgroup that had less then the allocated number of
            headers to download so that the dialog prompt does not
            appear.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Disabling of preference through the prefs.js preference file

      <ol>
        <li>Verify that setting the preference to false will not enable the
        mail start page feature and the mail start page will not attempt to
        load the next time launch messenger.</li>

        <li>Verify that setting the URL to an empty string will not enable
        the mail start page feature and the mail start page will not
        attempt to load.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Interruption of Loading of Mail Start Page</h3>

  <p>These tests should be performed under IMAP, POP, and NNTP.</p>

  <ol class="uppCase">
    <li>Verify that the mail start page stops loading when the following
    actions are performed:

      <ol>
        <li>Click the Stop toolbar button</li>

        <li>Select a message</li>

        <li>Select another folder</li>

        <li>Perform for IMAP, POP, and NNTP</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Verify that the mail start page continues to load when the
    following actions are performed:

      <ol>
        <li>Sorting of the messages in the thread pane by clicking on the
        column headers. You are not necessarily selecting a message
        here.</li>

        <li>Expanding the newsgroup list in the folder pane. You are not
        necessarily selecting another folder/newsgroup here.</li>

        <li>Perform a random set of commands (that are enabled) as the
        start page is loading to verify that no adverse effects happen.
        This is probably best performed when dialed in on a slow connection
        (i.e.. 28.8K modem).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Closing of the mail window

      <ol>
        <li>Verify that as the mail start page is loading, closing the mail
        window will have no adverse effect.</li>

        <li>Verify that as the mail start page is loading, collapsing the
        message pane will have no adverse effect. The mail start page will
        stop loading. Showing the message pane again will not attempt to
        re-load the mail start page.</li>

        <li>Verify that as the mail start page is loading, exiting
        Communicator will have no adverse effect.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Non Loading of Mail Start Page</h3>

  <p>The Mail Start Page should not load or attempt to load for the
  following.</p>

  <ol class="uppCase">
    <li>Verify if you disable the start page through the preference dialog,
    the start page does not load.</li>

    <li>Verify if you delete the contents of the start page location field
    url through the preference dialog, the start page does not load.</li>

    <li>Verify if you set the start page location field to an incorrect
    through the preference dialog, the start page does not load.</li>

    <li>Verify if the web site specified in the location field is busy that
    it should time out after a specific amount of time.</li>

    <li>Verify the start page does not load if the message pane was
    collapsed by default.</li>

    <li>Any subsequent time that the 3 pane mail window is opened during a
    Communicator session

      <ol>
        <li>Close all open 3 pane mail windows, but do not close the
        browser or composer windows. Bring up the 3 pane mail window again.
        Verify that the mail start page does not load.</li>

        <li>Preference set to open a new mail window when double-clicking
        on a mail folder. Double-click on another mail folder. Verify that
        when the second 3 pane mail window opens, the mail start page does
        not load.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Set your 3 pane mail window to collapse the message pane so that
    only the folder pane and the thread pane are displayed. Exit and
    restart Communicator. Open the mail window (now 2 pane) for the first
    time. Verify there is no attempt to load the mail start page.

      <ol>
        <li>Select a message in the thread pane and expand the message
        pane. Verify there is no attempt to load the mail start page and
        that the contents of the selected message display fine.</li>

        <li>Select a message in the thread pane and open into a separate
        message window. Verify there is no attempt to load the mail start
        page and that the contents of the selected message display
        fine.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Mail Notification Program (nsnotify.exe, This feature is yet to be
    determine if it will be implemented in seamonkey)

      <ol>
        <li>Start Communicator via the Mail Notification Program to bring
        up a mail compose window. Verify the mail start page does load if
        the message pane is open by default.</li>

        <li>Start Communicator via the Mail Notification Program to bring
        up the Messenger window, the mail start page does load (assume
        Communicator was not previous running) and if the message pane is
        open by default.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Mail Start Page Content</h3>

  <p class="note">QA will NOT be checking for the accuracy of any
  information found on the start page besides verifying the visual layout
  of this page and that URL links are click able.</p>

  <ol class="uppCase">
    <li>Verify that the correct start page gets loaded.</li>

    <li>Verify that all URL links located on this start page can be
    accessed. When the URL is clicked, a browser window opens to load the
    URL.</li>

    <li>Verify URL gets added to history and is accessible from the history
    window.</li>

    <li>Re-size the message pane and/or the 3 pane mail window. Verify that
    the start page content gets reloaded and re-sized correctly.</li>

    <li>Substitute a page with frames as the default mail start page. Even
    though the specification states that the default mail start page cannot
    be set to one containing frames, verify that no bad side effects
    occur.</li>

    <li>Preference set to disable JavaScript in mail/news. Set your default
    mail start page to a test page that has JavaScript in it. Exit and
    restart Communicator. Open the 3 pane mail window. Verify that the
    JavaScript functionality in the mail start page does not
    execute/work.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Operations when Mail Start Page is loaded</h3>

  <ol class="uppCase">
    <li>Menu items (including context menus)

      <ol>
        <li>Access each menu item that gets enabled from the 3 pane mail
        window when the mail start page is loaded. Verify that the result
        of selecting each menu item makes sense and functions
        properly.</li>

        <li>Review each menu item that gets disabled from the 3 pane mail
        window when the mail start page is loaded. Verify that the
        disabling of these menu items are acceptable.</li>

        <li>Right click to bring up the context menu. Verify that the
        context menu items are the same ones displayed if you were to bring
        up the context menu for any html message displayed in the message
        pane. Exceptions would be any item having to do with replying,
        forwarding, or any action related to thinking that the mail start
        page is a mail message. Perform for various elements of the mail
        start page:

          <ol class="lowCase">
            <li>blank spaces</li>

            <li>URL</li>

            <li>images</li>

            <li>selected text</li>

            <li>tables</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Toolbar buttons

      <ol>
        <li>Access each toolbar button that gets enabled from the 3 pane
        mail window when the mail start page is loaded. Verify that the
        result of clicking each toolbar button makes sense and functions
        properly.</li>

        <li>Review each toolbar button that gets disabled from the 3 pane
        mail window when the mail start page is loaded. Verify that the
        disabling of these toolbar buttons are acceptable.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Verify that you can/cannot choose add bookmark to add the mail
    start page URL to your bookmark list.</li>

    <li>Re-size the 3 pane mail window. Re-sizing the window should work as
    expected.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Additional Start Page tests</h3>

  <p>The logo icon is located on the upper right corner of any window. It's
  the mozilla icon for public build and netscape icon for the commercial
  build. Clicking on the icon will cause the default url to be loaded in
  the browser window. These url are different for mozilla and commercial
  builds.</p>

  <ol class="uppCase">
    <li>Open messenger then click on the logo icon in the upper right
    corner of messenger window while the start page is loading. Verify the
    start page loading is not affected.</li>

    <li>Open messenger then click on the logo icon in the upper right
    corner of any non mail window will continue to load the default url
    into a browser window. Verify for:

      <ol>
        <li>Browser window</li>

        <li>Composer window</li>

        <li>Mail Compose window</li>

        <li>Calendar</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Verify that the tooltip for the logo icon in any of the mail
    windows is accurate.</li>

    <li>Verify that clicking on the the logo icon has no effect on any
    selected message in the 3 pane Mail window. We do not change anything
    in the message pane of that window.</li>

    <li>Verify that these preferences work for the following different
