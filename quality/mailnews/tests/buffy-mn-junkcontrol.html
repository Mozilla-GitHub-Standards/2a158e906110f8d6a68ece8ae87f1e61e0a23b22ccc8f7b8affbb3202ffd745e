  <h3>Junk Mail Controls</h3>

  <p>Junk Mail Controls (JMC) functionality is based on training a file to
  recognize "Junk" mail based on the users actions. As training happens,
  the Junk Controls (JC) will have a higher percentage of correctly marking
  incoming mail as junk/not junk. Training is accomplished by user marking
  messages as Junk and removing the Junk status if a mail message is
  erroneously marked as Junk. The training does not compare message to
  message or sender to sender but collects information and combinations of
  information to create the training file. Therefore in testing this
  feature, we're looking for the Junk Mail Control to get better at
  evaluating Junk mail within a profile as usage goes up.</p>

  <h3>Mail Junk Controls- Basic UI functionality IMAP, POP &amp; Other</h3>

  <ol class="uppCase">
    <li>Verify all default states listed above:

      <ol>
        <li>Verify all Default states are correct for a New Profile</li>

        <li>Verify all Default states are correct for Existing 7.x
        profile</li>

        <li>Verify all Default states are correct for Migrated 4.7
        profile</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Verify correct functionality of Junk Control dialog UI:

      <ol>
        <li>Verify you can turn Junk Control On /Off by checking/unchecking
        the option and it holds the state through exit and relaunch.</li>

        <li>Verify the list of accounts is complete with all the mail
        accounts you have listed in the folder pane (Local Folders should
        not be listed).</li>

        <li>Verify newly added mail accounts are listed and the junk
        controls are in the Default state.</li>

        <li>Verify you can turn on/off the option to exclude as junk mail,
        senders who are in in a selected address book, by
        checking/unchecking the option.</li>

        <li>Verify you can select any Address book listed in the dropdown
        (no ABook lists or Directories should be listed), and the selection
        holds through exit and relaunch.</li>

        <li>Verify you can turn on/off the option to Move incoming Junk
        messages to a designated folder, by checking/unchecking the
        option.</li>

        <li>Verify AOL mail accounts are not listed in the Move Junk Mail
        option dropdown</li>

        <li>Verify you can designate any existing mail folder (including
        folders in Local Folders) as the designated folder for moving to
        Junk.</li>

        <li>Verify the designated folder, is moved to the top of the folder
        list and becomes a "Special" folder complete w/icon.</li>

        <li>Verify you can toggle between the auto created Junk folder
        [default mail server] or user specified (Other) location.</li>

        <li>Verify you can turn on/off the automatic option for deleting
        junk messages after a certain period and you can change the numeric
        value for "days".</li>

        <li>Verify you have a training.dat file in the .slt directory of
        the profile you are using. (At this time you don't get one until
        Junk Control is turned on, but it will be on by default for the
        release therefore the .dat file should be created after adding a
        mail account.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Verify "Junk" folder creation &amp; classification as "special" per
    mail account:

      <ol>
        <li>IMAP, if no Junk folder exists, we create one and make it
        "special"</li>

        <li>IMAP, if a Junk folder exists, we make it "special"</li>

        <li>POP, we create the Junk folder and make it "special"</li>

        <li>User created folder, designated as the junk folder, we make it
        "special", remove "special" status of default Junk folder.</li>

        <li>Designated junk folders (default or user created) can not be
        deleted.</li>

        <li>Default Junk folders that are no longer "special" can be
        deleted.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

    account that collects junk mail regularly and has several folders that
    contain both junk and not junk mail . IMAP accounts used for this test
    should not be active on any other system because each message on the
    server is flagged with the junk status.).</span>

            <li>Get new messages, scan through the thread list, marking 10
            or so messages as Junk. Verify the junk icon displays in the
            column for each one you marked as junk. Verify the status bar
            shows activity which indicates the training.dat file is being
            accessed. Exit, relaunch and get new messages, verify the
            messages are still listed as Junk. (Note, if you have received
            new Junk mail more than likely it will not be detected as Junk
            yet, the training file is still to new, mark it as junk

            messages as Junk and have changed the Junk status of some
            messages that were incorrectly labeled. Exit and relaunch,
            verify the Mail Junk Control is correctly identifying Junk/Not
            Junk at about 20%= accuracy.</li>

  <h3>Junk Mail Log</h3>

  <h3>Other issues</h3>

    <li>Junk Mail Control training.dat file is Profile related. However,
    Enabling JMC is per mail account.

      <ol>
        <li>Set up a Profile with multiple Mail accounts and set all to
        enable JMC. Verify it works on all accounts within the
        profile.</li>

        <li>Set up a Profile with multiple Mail accounts and set 1/2 of the
        accounts to enable JMC. Verify only those accounts with JMC enabled
        are evaulating incoming mail as Junk.</li>

        <li>Set up a Profile with multiple Mail accounts various types
        (IMAP, POP &amp; Other), set all to enable JMC. Verify it works on
        all accounts within the profile</li>
