Because this feature is testing conversion and includes test cases, this test spec is 
written in text and not html.

Known Issues:
In build 2000022708 there is a bug in where certain conversions like :) or
(c) do not take place if the e-mail is sent from Mozilla in the format of
"Plain Text and HTML" or just HTML only.  The conversions do work correctly
if the message is sent only in "Plain Text" from Mozilla or from Eudora.

<BenB> Alan: can you also test for entities, i.e. &trade; etc.?
<BenB> this is about *entering" &trade;, when (tm) was there
<BenB> I'm talking about an already inserted &trade; inside an URL staying
sane etc.
<BenB> in this case, of course, the URL shouldn't be linked,  compare 19313

The following information can can be e-mailed to test different functions.

Many items will NOT be converted if a space is inserted like * bold*.

*bold* -> <srong>bold<srong>
/italic/  -> <em class=txt_slash>italic</em>     ** DON'T THINK IT IS
WORKING **
_underline_  <em class=txt_underline> emphasis</em>  ** NOT WORKING **
|code|  -> <code class=txt_verticalline>code</code>  ** NOT WORKING **

(c) -> &copy (copyright sign)
(r) -> &reg  (registered trade mark sign)
+/- -> &plusmn (plus or minus sign)

Other Characters to consider:
http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/symbols.html
http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/latin1.html
http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/special.html

^2  -> <sup>2</sup>            ** I thought this was supposed to work!!! **
2^2 -> 2<sup>2</sup>
a^25 -> a<sup>25</sup>
2^b  -> not converted as b is not a digit.
a^b  -> not converted as b is not a digit.

:-)  -> smile.gif
:)   -> smile.gif
:-(  -> frown.gif
:(   -> frown.gif
;-)  -> wink.gif
;-P  -> sick.gif

;)   -> wink.gif (will not work)

Note for users: For best results, put a space between smilies and closing
brackets. Otherwise, the code can't distinguish a smily plus a closing
bracket from a smily with a large smile, and no substitution is done.
Don't omit the closing bracket after a smily (e.g. that way :-), or your
parenthesis will look unbalanced (after all, they are).

URL Tests
www.mozilla.org
http://www.mozilla.org
<http://www.mozilla.org>
"http://www.mozilla.org"

<a href="http://www.mozilla.org.com">"Mozilla site"</a>
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org.com">Mozilla site</a>
<URL:http://www.mozilla.org>

<news://news.mozilla.org/1234@any.msg.id.com>

<URL:http://www.mozilla.org  will work becae of the http://

In the cases with angle brakes and double quotes as delimiters, the
delimiters should be included in the link, e.g. <a
href="http://a.com">"http://a.com"</a>, but not in all other cases.

MAIL TESTS

asj@ipa.net
mailto:asj@ipa.net
<asj@bigfoot.com>

The following strings are not substituted:
|TXT   |HTML     |Reason
+------+---------+----------
 ->     &larr;    Bug #454
 =>     &lArr;    dito
 <-     &rarr;    dito
 <=     &rArr;    dito
 (tm)   &trade;   dito
 1/4    &frac14;  is triggered by 1/4 Part 1, 2/4 Part 2, ...
 3/4    &frac34;  dito
 1/2    &frac12;  similar

SPECIAL TEST CASES

5 * 3 * 4 = 60 -> should do nothing (spaces and not alpha)
5*5*6=150      -> should do nothing (no alpha character)
5*A*6*1=Z      -> should do nothing (no leading/ending spaces)
5 * A * 6 * 1 = Z  -> should do nothing

Multi character test with spaces in the middle *This is a test*
Multi character test with spaces in the middle /This is a test/
Multi character test with spaces in the middle _This is a test_

Multi line test that won't work *This is
a test*

In all cases, please tale special care about special cases, like line
start, line end and special characters, and unusual real life cases (like
the multiplication above or
"bla (mozilla@bucksch.org, " or source code).

This is an e-mail test of text conversions.

The four items like *bold*  /italic/ _underline_  |code| should all be
easily converted.  Adding a comma between the four items should be
converted *bold*, /italic/, _underline_, and |code|.
