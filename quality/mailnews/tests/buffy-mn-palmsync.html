  <h2>Mail and News Component: Address Book Palm Synchronization</h2>

  <address class="author">
    Written by Gregg Meehan, updated by Ninoschka Baca
  </address>

  <h3>References</h3>

  <p><a href=
  "http://mozilla.org/mailnews/arch/MozAB_Palm_HotSync.html">Palm Sync
  Technical Specification by Rajiv Dayal</a></p>

  <h3>Description</h3>

  <p>The Palm OS has an address book application. For easier address book
  maintenance the Palm Desktop software is used to create, modify and
  delete data from the address book. When a HotSync is performed then both
  the Palm device and the Palm Desktop software have corresponding
  data.</p>

  <p>The Mozilla Address Book can be used in place of the Palm Desktop
  software. After installing the Address Book Palm Sync Installer and
  selecting the HotSync button then a synchronization occurs between the
  Palm device and the Mozilla Address Book.</p>

  <h3>Terms:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The Palm device uses the term "Record" which includes the name,
    address, email address, phone number etc... for a user.</li>

    <li>The Palm device uses "Categories" to describe a group of records
    (i.e. you could have a category for your Doctors).</li>

    <li>Mozilla does not use "Category" as a term but after a HotSync the
    categories become separate address books (i.e. after a HotSync the user
    would have a Personal Address Book and a Doctors address book in the
    Mozilla Address Book window)</li>

    <li>AB= Address Book</li>

    <li>HotSync= press the HotSync button on the palm's cradle</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Supported Palm Software/Hardware: TBD</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Any Palm Compatible Platform device (e.g. Palm III and above, Palm
    m100 Series and above, Handspring Visor)

      <ul>
        <li>More Palm examples, i.e. Palm m500 series, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Primary platform for the Palm Desktop is 4.1. and HotSync version
    4.0.x</li>

    <li>Secondary platform Palm Desktop 3.5 and HotSync version 3.1.x</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Use the logging facility</strong>:<br>
  If problems occur then use the logging facility to see more details. It
  will also be helpful to attach the file to a bug report.</p>

  <p>Create an environment variable MOZ_CONDUIT_LOG. For example, set
  MOZ_CONDUIT_LOG to a file path like C:\\TEMP\\ConduitLog.txt.</p>

  <p><strong>Some Mozilla build users may have problems installing the
  Address Book Palm Sync Conduit</strong>:<br>
  To enable Palm sync you need 2 files which are redistributable by Palm.
  However, Mozilla can not redistribute them since they are not open
  source. Select this link for <a href=
  "http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182573#c2">instructions</a>
  on correcting the problem.</p>

  <h3>Visual</h3>

  <ol class="uppCase">
    <li>Verify after the installation that the "Address Book Palm Sync
    Install" and the "Address Book Palm Sync Uninstall menu items appear
    off of the Window's Start menu.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Functionality</h3>

  <ol class="uppCase">
    <li>Verify the AB HotSync process is initiated:

      <ol>
        <li>Verify the AB HotSync process is initiated with the Mozilla
        application closed and Quick Launched turned off</li>

        <li>Verify the AB HotSync process is initiated with the Mozilla
        application closed and Quick Launch is turned on</li>

        <li>Verify the AB HotSync process is initiated with the Mozilla
        application running with the Browser window open</li>

        <li>Verify the AB HotSync process is initiated with the Mozilla
        application running with Mail window open</li>

        <li>Verify the AB HotSync process is initiated with the Mozilla
        application running with the Address Book window open</li>

        <li>Verify the AB HotSync process is initiated with the Mozilla
        application closed, preferences set for Mail to open and Browser
        not to open and Quick Launch turned off.</li>

        <li>Verify the AB HotSync process is initiated with the Mozilla
        application closed, preferences set for Mail to open and Browser
        not to open and Quick Launch turned on.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Verify data created in the Mozilla Address Book appears on the palm
    device after a HotSync

      <ol>
        <li>Verify creating one card in Mozilla's AB displays on the palm
        device after a HotSync</li>

        <li>Verify creating an address book with no cards in Mozilla's AB
        displays on the palm device after a HotSync. The newly created
        category should have no records.</li>

        <li>Verify creating a second card in a newly created address book
        in Mozilla's AB displays on the palm device. The second card should
        appear as a new record in the newly created category (i.e.
        Doctors)</li>

        <li>Verify creating another card an existing address book (i.e.
        Doctors) in Mozilla's AB displays on the palm device. In this case
        the category for Doctors already exists so the record should just
        be added.</li>

        <li>Verify creating multiple cards in multilple address books in
        Mozilla's AB displays on the palm device. If some/all of the
        corresponding address books don't exist on the palm device, they
        will be created as catergories and the new records will be added to
        them.</li>

        palm device after a HotSync</li>

        displays in the Mozilla AB after a HotSync. The newly created
        category should appear as a separate address book with no
        cards.</li>

        <li>Verify creating a second record in a newly created category in
        the palm device displays in the Mozilla AB. The second record
        should appear as a card in a newly created address book in the
        Mozilla AB (i.e. Doctors)</li>

        <li>Verify creating another record in an existing category (i.e.
        Doctors) in the palm device displays in Mozilla's AB. In this case
        the address book for Doctors already exists so the new record
        should appear as a card.</li>

        <li>Verify creating multiple records in multiple categories in the
        palm device displays in Mozilla's AB. If some/all of the
        corresponding records do not exist in the Mozilla AB, they will be
        created as new cards in the corresponding address books.</li>
      </ol>

    <li>Verify deleted <span class="c1">categories/address books names on
    the palm device and the Mozilla Address Book window updates both sides
    after a HotSync.<br>
      Note1: When deleting a category that includes records, the palm
      device will move the records to the Unfiled category. After a sync
      the corresponding address book should be gone but the records should
      appear in Mozilla's Unfiled address book.<br>
      Note2: When deleting a Mozilla address book that includes records,
      this action completely removes the address book and the cards. After
      a sync the corresponding category also completely removes the
      category and its records.</span>

        <li>Verify deleting one category in the palm device and the same

        than 15 characters that the name is truncated to 15 characters as a

        <li>All Netscape fields with the exception of the Notes and Address
        fields cannot contain multiple lines. Verify when synchronizing,

        changed to single line entries with each line separated by
        ",".</li>

        <li>Verify the phone order appears as expected since the user can
        choose the label for each field on the palm device where as the
        Mozilla AB has static phone labels.

          <ol>
            <li>Verify after entering numbers for each default phone entry
            that they appear in logical order in the Mozilla AB</li>

            order in the Mozilla AB</li>

            <li>Verify after entering numbers for each phone entry where
            each is assigned the same label (i.e. Home) that they appear in
            logical oder in the Mozilla AB?</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Verify a HotSync with an LDAP directory works as expected

      <ol>
        <li>Verify an LDAP directory does not appear on the palm device
        after a Hot Sync?</li>

        <li>Verify after replicating an LDAP directory (which makes it
        possible to search for addresses while offline) and a Hotsync that
        the entries appear on the palm device?</li>
