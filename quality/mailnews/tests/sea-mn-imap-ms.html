<br> See the mailnewsqa <a href="http://slip/client/mailnews/lab/lab_software.html">test

<br>Approx. number of test cases: 164
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>Description: </b>This test plan includes test cases for IMAP functionalities
of the mail5 client while running against the Netscape Messaging Server
(MS). We need to test against several versions of the Messaging Server
(at a minimum, 2.0, 3.5, and 4.0), and not all will have the same functionality
or behavior. Differences between server versions will be noted in each
test case as applicable. Details of the test plan relevant only to MS,
and not to all other types of servers, are marked in <font color="#FF0000">red</font>.
(Documentation between version differences aren't readily available; some
changes to the "expected outcome" column will be filled in as testing progresses,
and used as a reference for future testing.)
<p>This plan is broken down into modules containing specific IMAP command
execution tests and more complex scenarios.
<p>Testing of attachments will largely be handled in the MIME test plan.
<p><u>Tests for these commands may be written later (if we decide to support
them):</u>
<br>KERBEROS_V4, GSSAPI, and S_KEY authentication mechanisms
<p><u>Support for functionalities that use the following commands has been
dropped:</u>
<br>SETACL, DELETEACL, GETACL, LISTRIGHTS, MYRIGHTS
<p><u>I don't believe we ever used:</u>
<br>CLOSE, EXAMINE, STATUS, SETQUOTA, GETQUOTA, GETQUOTAROOT

and the success of selecting the folder in, hopefully, read-write mode.

UIDs for each of the messages in that folder.

the folder, in order to have to information to populate the thread pane.
