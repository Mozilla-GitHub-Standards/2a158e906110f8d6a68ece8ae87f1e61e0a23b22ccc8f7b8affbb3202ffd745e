<li>
CAPABILITY</li>

<br>Server MUST send a single untagged CAPABILITY response with "IMAP4rel1"
as one of the listed capabilities before the (tagged) OK response
<ol>
<li>
Confirm that on initial connect, a CAPABILITY command is issued by the
client&nbsp; => IMAP log shows CAPABILITY command/listing and its response
from the server</li>

<li>
Respect lack of&nbsp; NAMESPACE response</li>

<ul TYPE=SQUARE>
<li>
(Note: Don't ask for namespaces if the server has told us they don't support
namespaces. <font color="#FF0000">Old Netscape servers don't send this
response)</font></li>

<li>
=> If the server has not returned "NAMESPACE" in their reply, we don't
follow up with a "namespace" command shortly after connecting.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Respect lack of X-NETSCAPE response</li>

<ul TYPE=SQUARE>
<li>
<font color="#FF0000">(Note: Recent Netscape servers send us the XSERVERINFO
response. I think that's what triggers us to know that we can offer client-based
server admin.)</font></li>

<li>
=> If the server has not sent us the XSERVERINFO in the capability response,we
shouldn't ask for "XSERVERINFO MANAGEACCOUNTURL MANAGELISTSURL MANAGEFILTERSURL."</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
</ol>

<li>
LOGIN/AUTHENTICATE:</li>

<ol>
<li>
Login when the sever is down. => Appropriate timeout/error message/note
and confirmation</li>

<li>
Cancel login before entering the username and the password. => Shold drop
the connection to the server</li>

<li>
Username/Password combination:</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
Correct password => IMAP log shows LOGIN OK</li>

<li>
Incorrect password</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<ol>
<ul TYPE=SQUARE>&nbsp;</ul>
</ol>

<li>
NAMESPACE</li>

<ol>
<li>
(If the server responded with NAMESPACE in its capability statement) issue
a namespace command.(Note: I THINK we're supporting multiple namespaces
in mail5, UI TBD for all of this stuff)&nbsp; => Check the IMAP log for
the namespace command which followed by the server's response - IMAP log
should show namespace request</li>

<li>
LSUB additional namespaces on connect (for servers that support namespaces):&nbsp;
(Note: We should show an LSUB in the IMAP log for each namespace that the
server has told us about)&nbsp; => LSUB for each namespace - Confirm that
the folders that exist in each namespace appear in the folder pane and
are selectable/usable by the user.</li>

<li>
Load a folder that's in a non-default namespace. (Note: Supported namespace
types in mail5 TBD. I think we're still going to offer other user's and
shared namespaces. More granularity of test cases after a spec comes out)</li>

<li>
Create a new folder in a non-default namespace.</li>

<li>
Delete a folder in a non-default namespace.</li>

<li>
Copy a message to a folder in a non-default namespace from the default
namespace.</li>

<li>
Copy a message to a folder in a non-default namespace from the default
namespace.</li>

<li>
Drag and drop a folder from the default namespace to a non-default namespace.</li>

<li>
Drag and drop a folder from a non-default namespace to the default namespace.</li>

<li>
Change namespace settings => Change may require a restart, but should be
successful. Note steps necessary for success; if not very easy, confirm
requirement w/eng.</li>

<li>
Make personal namespace be something other than the user's server home</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
SELECT / initial FETCH (fetch flags, headers)</li>

<ol>
<li>
Inbox:</li>

<ul>
<li>
When a user selects a folder, the server will return the following information:</li>

<br>* select "INBOX"
<br>* FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged\Draft \Deleted \Seen $Forwarded $MDNSent)
<br>* OK [PERMANENTFLAGS(\Answered \Flagged \Draft\Deleted \Seen $Forwarded
$MDNSent \*)]
<br>* 4 EXISTS
<br>* 0 RECENT
<br>* OK [UIDVALIDITY 904023909]
<br>* OK [READ-WRITE] Completed
<li>
Note: To the user, selecting is performed by clicking on a folder. The
IMAP log will show the client running an URL, e.g., URL: Loading IMAP://tintin?select>/INBOX
>. (This test case will actually test SELECT and several different forms
of FETCH executed by that URL.)</li>

<br>Being, in order, a listing of the defined types of flag for that folder;
a listing of the types of permanent flag that are possible; how many messages
exist; how many of those messages are recent (ones the user has not yet
seen the headers of); the UIDVALIDITY (must be sent by the server for all
FETCH responses,but we don't do anything with it to the best of my knowledge;
and the success of selecting the folder in, hopefully, read-write mode.
After the Select returns OK, we do a UID fetch 1* (FLAGS), which causes
the server to return the flags and UIDs for each of the messages in that
folder. Next, we do a fetch for all of the headers for all of the messages
in the folder, in order to have to information to populate the thread pane.
(However, if the summary file already contains that information for some
of the messages, the request tothe server is only made for those messages
that are unknown to it, as in "11 UID fetch 11564:11572 (UID RFC822.SIZE
FLAGS BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS
<br>(From To Cc Subject Date Priority X-Priority Message-ID References
Newsgroups Return-Receipt-To Disposition-Notification-To)])"
<br>Finally (if the first message is to be automatically loaded upon folder
selection), we fetch the body for the first message, as in
<br>&nbsp;" 19 UID fetch 11550 (XSENDER UID RFC822.SIZE BODY[])" When testing,
confirm that all of the headers and flags are displayed in the UI as expected.</ul>

<li>
Default folders</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
Sent folder. (Note: If not specified, the folder named is presumed to be
in a subscribed state)</li>

<li>
Trash folder.</li>

<li>
Drafts folder</li>

<li>
Templates folder</li>
</ol>

<li>
Generic top-level folder</li>

<li>
NoSelect top-level folder (Note:NoSelect folders shouldn't be selectable)</li>

<li>
Subscribed folder</li>

<li>
Unsubscribed folder (Not yet defined whether we'll be displaying unsubscribed
folders</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
Subscribed subfolder where parent folder isn't subscribed</li>
</ol>

<li>
Top-level folder in a specified IMAP directory (off of the user's home
directory on the server)</li>

<li>
Second-level folder:</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
Subfolder of Inbox <font color="#FF0000">(No such thing with Messaging
server)</font></li>

<li>
Subfolder in a specified IMAP directory</li>
</ol>

<li>
Empty folder => All expected communications between server and folder should
appear in the IMAP log, though there are no messages.</li>

<li>
Folders Stress Test:</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
Folder 20 levels deep</li>

<li>
Folder that has been deleted by another client that has a concurrent session
open to this account => Appropriate error message (folder does not exist).
We may choose to remove this folder from the display immediately, or at
the next restart. That issue is covered more specifically in the DELETE
section.</li>

<li>
Folder containing 10k messages => Note time taken. Confirm appropriateness
of behavior w/development.</li>

<li>
Folder containing 500 message-containing subfolders.</li>

<li>
Folder that is selected by another client that has a concurrent session
open to this folder => No error; I think the folder will be opened as read-only,
though, not read-write. Check log, try to delete message while folder is
selected to see if its contents can be modified. Confirm appropriateness
of behavior w/development.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>
</ol>

<li>
FETCH (body):</li>

<ol TYPE=A>
<ol>
<li>
Plain text message (Note: Fetching a message body is also initiated with
an URL. This one looks like: URL: Loading IMAP://tintin?fetch>UID>/INBOX>11501)</li>

<br>=> The IMAP log will show a line that looks like: 12 UID fetch 11501
(XSENDER
<br>UID RFC822.SIZE BODY[]. At the end of the message, there will appear
<br>something like: "tintin:S-INBOX:STREAM:CLOSE: Normal Message End Download
Stream STREAM: Normal End Message Download Stream Event
<br>12 OK Completed" Make sure there are no errors in the log, and that
the message view pane.
<li>
HTML message</li>

<li>
Message with vcard</li>

<li>
Message with sig</li>

<li>
Signed message</li>

<li>
Encrypted message</li>

<li>
Signed and encrypted message</li>

<li>
Message with attached web page</li>

<li>
Message with base64 attachment</li>

<li>
Message with unencoded attachment</li>

<li>
Message with extremely long subject line (300 chars?)</li>

<li>
Message with extremely long to: list</li>

<li>
(rows left to add cases related tovarious TBD preferences that may affect
fetching)</li>

<li>
Message Stress Test:</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
Message with large attachment (5MB) (Note: Some mail servers are set up
to limit the size of attachments that it routes. If this test fails, first
check the server settingsto see if it has imposed a limit.</li>

<li>
Message with base64 attachment (Note: I don't think the form of encoding
would make any difference to FETCHING it, but it can't hurt to include
these tests; it might turn up other problems, anyway.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>
</ol>
</ol>

<li>
FETCH (biff)</li>

<ol>
<li>
You've got mail! (Note: When we check for new mail, we do this by trying
to fetch any messages with a message ID of the next expected one and higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;
=> An example that shows the client finding out about one new message,
then asking for its headers:</li>

<br>21 UID fetch 11573:
<br>* (FLAGS)
<br>* 14 FETCH (FLAGS (\Recent) UID 11573) 21 OK Completed
<br>22 UID fetch 11573 (UID RFC822.SIZE FLAGS BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS (From
To Cc Subject Date Priority X-Priority Message-ID References Newsgroups
Return-Receipt-To Disposition-Notification-To)])
<li>
No new mail. => An example that shows the client finding out that there
are no new messages. The server tells us that the last message is the one
we already know about:</li>

<br>24 UID fetch 11574:* (FLAGS)
<br>* 14 FETCH (FLAGS (\Recent) UID 11573)
<br>24 OK Completed
<li>
Multiple new messages => Example follows. Note the format of the</li>

<br>message header fetch for multiple UIDs.
<br>30 UID fetch 11615:* (FLAGS)
<br>* 9 FETCH (FLAGS (\Recent) UID 11615)
<br>* 10 FETCH (FLAGS (\Recent) UID 11616)
<br>* 11 FETCH (FLAGS (\Recent) UID 11617)
<br>30 OK Completed
<br>31 UID fetch 11615:11617(UID RFC822.SIZE
<br>FLAGS BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS
<br>(From To Cc Subject Date Priority X-Priority
<br>Message-ID References Newsgroups
<br>Return-Receipt-To
<br>Disposition-Notification-To)])
<li>
A new message that was already marked read by another client with a concurrent
connection to the account&nbsp; => [get log example...pretty much the same,
except there won't be a \Recent flag.]</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
STORE</li>

<ol>
<li>
Add \Answered flag: (Note: Store is used to add flags to a message. This
flag can be added by responding to a message. It's also initiated with
an URL, such as URL: Loading IMAP://tintin?addmsgflags>UID>/INBOX>11602>2</li>

<br>=> The next time the folder is selected, it should show an /Answered
flag
<br>with the message. The actual store will look something like this:
<br>20 uid store 11602 +Flags (\Answered)&nbsp; * 5 FETCH (FLAGS (\Recent\Answered
\Seen) UID 11602) 20 OK Completed IMHO, for all of
<br>these STORE tests, it's best to do a full restart when checkingthem...that
will show not only that the flag was added, but that the addition successfully
carries over between sessions.[note: check temp flag info in RFC]
<li>
Add \Flagged: (Note: This flag can be added by flagging a message.)</li>

<li>
Add \Draft : (Note: [check])</li>

<li>
Add \Deleted: (Note: This flag can be added by deleting a message with
either the IMAP or move-to-trash delete models.) => If mail5 automatically
expunges at exit, permanence of this flag may not be able to be checked
after a restart.</li>

<li>
Add \Seen: (Note: This flag can be added by displaying a message.)</li>

<li>
Add $Forwarded (Note: This flag can be added by forwarding a message.)</li>

<li>
Add $MDNSent (Note: This flag can be added by responding to a message.)</li>

<li>
Remove\Flagged (Note: Use whatever UI mech is available to unflag.)</li>

<br>=>Remove flags actions are just like flag additions, except for the
value of the sign: 20 uid store 11602 -Flags (\Flagged)
<li>
Remove\Deleted (Note: Use undo, assuming there is one in the UI )</li>

<li>
Remove \Seen (Note:Mark message as unread)</li>

<li>
Add multiple flags to the same messagein the same session (Note: There's
no reason you couldn't add them all in a session.) => All flags should
be successfully added.</li>

<li>
Remove multiple flags in the same session (Note: All of the removable flags
should be able to be deleted in a given session.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
UID: (Note: Test cases for the UID command are inherent in the tests written
for FETCH, STORE, COPY, and SEARCH test cases.)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
UIDVALIDITY</li>

<ol>
<li>
Any change of unique identifiers between sessions MUST be detectable using
the&nbsp; UIDVALIDITY mechanism.</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
The next unique identifer value will not change unless new messages are
added to the mailbox.</li>

<li>
The next unique identifer value will change whenever new message are added
to the mailbox, even if those new messages are subsequently expunged</li>

<li>
The unique identifer validity value is sent in an UIDVALIDITY response
code in an OK untagged response at mailbox selection time. If unique identifer
from an earlier session fail to persist to this session, the unique identifer
validity value MUST be greater than the one used in the earlier session.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Test for one IMAP client</li>

<li>
Test for IMAP Multiple-clients</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
</ol>
</ol>

<li>
LIST</li>

<ol>
<li>
LIST a specific folder (Note: The LIST command returns information about
a folder or about a subset of folders, based on what was passed in as a
parameter. In its simplest form, we ask it about a particular folder. LISTing
the INBOX happens every time we connect, near the beginning of the log.)
=> 7 list "" "INBOX"&nbsp; The server passes back</li>

<br>information about the folder's name attributes, hierarchy delimiter,
and name:
<br>* LIST (\NoInferiors) "/" INBOX 7 OK Completed
<li>
List a subfolder of a regular folder => 5 list "" "personal/sub_of_personal"
, followed by the server response:</li>

<br>* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "/" personal/sub_of_personal 5 OK Completed
<li>
LIST a /NoSelect folder (Note: Have a /NoSelect folder in your top-level
hierarchy. Collapse and expand your server hierarchy (if such an action
is supported by the UI) The /NoSelect folder will be LISTed.) =>&nbsp;
6 list "" "noselect" No detailed information will be</li>

<br>returned, only the "OK." 6 OK Completed.
<li>
LIST a subfolder of a /NoSelect folder (Note: Create a folder and subfolder
simultaneously, i.e., "folderone/foldertwo". The higher-level one will
be created as a /NoSelect folder. Immediately after the subfolder is created,
it will be LISTed.)</li>

<br>=>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 list "" "noselect/subfolder" Same type of result as
for a subfolder of a regular folder:
<br>* LIST (\HasNoChildren) "/" noselect/subfolder 5 OK Completed
<li>
LIST with subscription turned off (Note: This list will be preceded by
the URL "URL:Loading IMAP://[servername]?discoverallboxes"</li>

<br>=>&nbsp; 18 list "" "%"&nbsp; This will return information for all
top-level folders, then an OK. Immediatly after that, we'll request information
for the next level of the hierarchy down:
<li>
19 list "" "%/%", which will cause to be returned all folder information
for the second level of folders in the hierarchy.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
LSUB</li>

<ol>
<li>
Initial LSUB on connection to an account</li>

<br>(Note: LSUB shows which folders are subscribed to by the user. It shouldn't
matter if the folder was subscribed to by any particular client; the folder
is either subscribed or it's not.)
<br>=> 5 lsub "" "*" followed by the server's list of all subscribed mailboxes.
<li>
Subscription turned off&nbsp; => No LSUBs should appear in the log.</li>

<li>
LSUB when subscribe window is opened.</li>

<br>(Note: [subscribe window may be totally different in mail5]
<br>We begin with the URL: URL: Loading IMAP://tintin?discoverallandsubscribedboxes)
<br>=> 8 lsub "" "*" [server responds with list of all subscribed]
<br>9 list "" "%" [server responds with list of all top-level folders]
<li>
folders] 10 list "" "%/%" [server responds with list of all second-level
folders]</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
CREATE</li>

<ol>
<li>
CREATE single top-level folder => Folder should be created and subscribed.</li>

<li>
CREATE container folder &amp; subfolder simultaneously</li>

<br>=>&nbsp; Folders should be created, and the non-NoSelect folder should
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be subscribed.
<li>
CREATE folder with subscription turned off</li>

<br>(Note: I think I remember some controversy over this. Double-check
bug database.) => Folder should not be subscribed?
<li>
CREATE subfolder of a folder that already contains messages</li>

<br>=> Subfolder should be created and subscribed.
<li>
Stress Test:</li>

<ol>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>
</ol>

<li>
DELETE</li>

<ol>
<li>
DELETE single top-level folder when the folder is selected</li>

is
<br>handled through the use of the /Deleted flag (see STORE section of
test) => Successful delete.
<li>
DELETE container folder &amp; subfolder simultaneously when the subfolder
is selected&nbsp; => Successful delete.</li>

<li>
DELETE subfolder of a folder that already contains messages when the folder
is selected => Successful delete.</li>

DELETE parent folder with multiple subfolders => Successful delete.</li>

<li>
DELETE subscribed folder => Successful delete.</li>

<br>DELETE unsubscribed folder (Note: Subscription will probably have to

RENAME</li>

<ol>
<li>
RENAME single top-level folder when the folder is selected</li>

<li>
RENAME an unsubscribed folder (Note: Subscription will probably have to
be turned off in order to see the folder, but that's really a UI issue,

<li>
Stress test:</li>

<br>RENAME a folder 20 levels deep</ol>

<li>
APPEND</li>

<li>
Stress Test:</li>

<li>
APPEND message to folder 20 levels deep.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
NOOP</li>

<ol>
<li>
Note: Noop is performed to synch mailbox states; it doesn't do anything,
though other IMAP commands may be spurred by it. There isn't much to test
with it except to check and make sure that we're not using them excessively
(which is a subjective call). If there are a lot of noops in the log, check
with a developer.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
CHECK</li>

<ol>
<li>
Note: This command is similar to NOOP. I'm not positive why we use it...it
might be related to synching mailbox state to resolve issues related to
multiple clients using one account. Will add test cases</li>

<li>
if/when it becomes necessary. In any case, it's a housekeeping command
not related to the success or failure of performing the manual actions
that the user initiates.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
EXPUNGE</li>

<ol>
<li>
Expunge automatically; threshold-triggered</li>

<br>(Note:&nbsp; This command purges folders of deleted messages.
<br>This test case focuses on the automatic purge of every folder that
<br>occurs when a folder is opened and it has more than the allowed limit
of deleted messages)
<br>=> The folder EXPUNGE is done, then the folder is normally selected
and the first message loaded.
<li>
Expunge inbox at exit (Note:This may be a preference in mail5. If it's
a settable preference, check both positive and negativ)</li>

<br>=> The INBOX is expunged at application exit.
<li>
Expunge manually (Note:There may be some sort of "expunge/compress/compact
folder" menu item. It may be</li>

<br>context-sensitive, allowing more than one folder to be selected when
<br>it is used. Test whatever makes sense when the UI is developed)
<li>
Expunge a folder while another client has a connection to it</li>

<br>=>&nbsp; Successful expunge. Other client should notice on next
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOOP, CHECK, or biff (FETCH)
<li>
Empty trash should expunge trash folder (Note: Only relevant for trash
delete model) =>&nbsp; Successful expunge</li>

<li>
Empty trash while trash folder is selected =>&nbsp; Successful expunge</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
COPY</li>

<ol>
<li>
COPY message from one top-level folder to another</li>

<br>(Note: Ensure that flags, time, date are preserved)
<br>=>&nbsp; Successful copy

</ol>

<li>
COPY message into each of the special folders</li>

<br>(inbox, trash, sent, templates, drafts)
<li>
COPY message from one IMAP server to another</li>

<li>
COPY message to nonexistent folder</li>

<br>(Note: Delete the folder with another client attached to the account)
<br>=> Appropriate error message.
<li>
COPY large message (5MB) from one folder to another</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
SUBSCRIBE</li>

<ol>
<li>
Subscribe to a top-level folder that is currently unsubscribed</li>

<br>(Note: Many of the possibilities of this component will be
<br>defined by the yet to-be-designed UI)
<li>
Try to subscribe to a NoSelect folder => Should not be possible</li>

<li>
Subscribe to a subfolder when the parent folder is subscribed</li>

<li>
Subscribe to a subfolder when the parent folder is not subscribed</li>

<li>
Subscribe to a folder three levels down when all parent folders are not
subscribed</li>

<li>
Subscribe to a folder when subscription is turned off</li>

<br>(Note: This may or may not be possible)
<li>
Subscribe to a folder (when subscription is turned off) and the folder
is currently selected</li>

<li>
Subscribe to a empty folder</li>

<li>
Subscribe to a folder with 10k messages</li>

<li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
SEARCH</li>

<ol>
<li>
SEARCH one folder</li>

<br>(Note: Many of these test cases will be influenced by the formation
of the UI)
<li>
SEARCH multiple folders (in a hierarchy)</li>

<li>
SEARCH a NoSelect folder => Shouldn't be possible</li>

<li>
SEARCH an unsubscribed folder (Note: May need to have subscription turned
off to do this)</li>

<li>
SEARCH for non-ascii characters</li>

<li>
SEARCH a folder with 10k messages</li>

<li>
Stress Test:</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
SEARCH a folder twenty levels deep</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>
</ol>

<li>
LOGOUT</li>

<ol>
<li>
At application exit</li>

<br>(Note: Logging out will occur at the end of a session and whenever
a
<br>connection to an inbox is intentionally stopped, as when the user doesn't
want to wait for a large message to finish downloading, and
<br>presses Stop. This test case is to make sure that we logout when the
<br>application exits. Check the end of the IMAP log.)
<br>=> Last lines should be something like:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOST?:S-INBOX:NET:WR: xxxx logout
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mozilla IMAP stdout:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOST?:S-INBOX:CONTROL:From
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TellThreadToDie: LOGOUT
<li>
During folder load</li>

<br>(Note: Press Stop while a folder's headers are downloading (after
<br>selecting it, before all of the threads have displayed. This may be
easiest to do the first time loading a folder after filing a lot of messages
to it, like Trash, or by exiting, deleting the summary file, restarting,
then selecting the folder.
<br>=> INTERRUPT Entered
<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tintin:S-Trash:NET:WR: xxxx logout</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
SPECIAL TESTS:</li>

<ol>
<li>
Upgrade to mail5 with an account that had been used with a client that
supports subscription, such as 4.5</li>

<br>(Note: No "subscription wizard" kind of thing has been designed yet
for mail5) => TBD
<li>
Upgrade to mail5 with an account that had been used with a client that
does not support subscription, such as 4.0x. => TBD</li>

<li>
Stop actions while they're being performed. => Mail should work fine, new
summary files generated.</li>

<li>
Delete local summary files and start mail. => Mail should work fine,</li>

<br>new summary files generated.
