<b></b>
<p><b>What is Networking QA?</b><b></b> </p>
<p>Networking QA can be divided into several main areas: </p>
<ul>
  <li> "Network behavior"<br>
    <br>
Exchanges of data between the browser and various network servers.
Although a browser is often perceived as a client that uses HTTP to
surf the web, there are actually an entire family of protocols that are
needed in a modern, full-featured browser. Mozilla, as currently built
and
released, has significant amounts of networking features relating to
installer,
mail, news, and chat.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> "Networking code"<br>
    <br>
Refers primarily to "Necko" as well as parts of&nbsp; XPCOM, NSPR, and
XP-Apps.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> "Internet standards"<br>
    <br>
Refers to the relevant RFC's (Request for Comments) and de facto
standards of behavior for TCP/IP based software. Reverse compatibility
with Netscape Communicator 4 (keyword: "4xp") and Internet Explorer is
a over-arching
goal as well.</li>
</ul>
<b>How are networking problems tracked by mozilla.org?</b><b></b>
<p>Contributors should understand that the "Networking" component is
only for certain "core" aspects of networking. Many bugs that look like
networking problems may end up in other components. </p>
<p>Here is a list of the more commonly mentioned components, and what
belongs in them:
<table width="100%" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Browser: Networking</td>
      <td>Necko issues that do not clearly belong in other "Browser"
components related to networking. Includes URL schemes, URL parsing,
DNS, Proxy, SOCKS, PAC.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Browser: Networking:File</td>
      <td>file:/// URLs and various file I/O functions in Necko</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Browser: Networking:FTP</td>
      <td>ftp://URLs and FTP client behavior</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Browser: Networking:HTTP</td>
      <td>http://URLs and http client behavior</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Browser: Networking: Cache</td>
      <td>Caching of HTTP, FTP and DNS</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cookies</td>
      <td>Closely related to HTTP</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>File Handling</td>
      <td>In a nutshell, if you are not going to look at something
(Layout), but save it to disk or a helper app.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">URL Bar<br>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">If something typed in the Location bar fails,
but works when put into a link, it's not a Necko bug.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Image Lib</td>
      <td>Display, caching and management of graphical content</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>MailNews</td>
      <td>Unless directly related to a component above, MailNews
networking problems stay with the MailNews product</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Installer</td>
      <td>Installer is mostly a separate HTTP|FTP client, and
networking problems stay with the Installer component.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">Docshell<br>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">Docshell is usually he layer that receives
networking errors and displays alerts<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">History<br>

      <td valign="top">"Back" and "Forward buttons"<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p> For a more specific description, look at the official component
descriptions: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
 href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Browser">Components
for Browser</a><br>
</p>
<p><b>Outdated special "networking rules"</b> (left for historical
purposes, for now)<a name="rules"></a><br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Networking has a "component-based" default owner. (For a while, there was an
email address that was a placeholder, so you could watch only the new bugs).
Most other components use the engineer as the default owner, which
does not work as well, because if you watch the engineer, you get all
their
bug mail, even if you are interested in only one thing. See bug <a
 href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120481">120481</a>&nbsp;for
more detailed discussion. The original proposal is available <a
 href="http://www.packetgram.com/pktg/mozilla/subtriage.html">here</a>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Networking has "sub-components", because it is so big and diverse<br>
    <br>
Conn (Connectivity)<br>
DNS<br>
Proxy<br>
SOCKS <br>
PAC <br>
IPv6 <br>
URL<br>
Finger<br>
Gopher<br>
about:<br>
res: | resource:<br>
data:<br>
text2HTML<br>
    <br>
Bugs relating to these specific areas should have the sub-component
at the beginning of the summary. (If you see bugs that do not conform
to this naming system, consider updating the summary. Eventually, we
might
have sub-component level mail tracking as well, by using the "QA owner"
field (for example, pacqa, socksqa, etc.)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Contributor (non-Netscape) QA and Verification.<br>
I'll provide a longer reason later, but if you find a bug that has
been fixed by the owner or marked "Works for me (WFM)" by the reporter,
if the bug has a milestone of "Futured" or "--", you can mark it
VERIFIED
(if you actually verify it as working).<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Not all networking behavior is actually tested in this area, mainly
due to the structure of the code and the relationship to Necko. For
testing purposes, Necko should be considered the stuff that finds and
gets info
on the network. Figuring out *what* is asked for, and how it is handled
is often something outside of Necko. For example, many "networking"
features in the UI are actually XP Apps that use Necko. The general
rule of thumb is HTTP and FTP are tested as part of Necko, everything
else (mailnews,
chatzilla, Netscape IM, installer) is handled by the module owner. </p>
<p><b>Who does Networking QA?</b></p>
<p>Update: Netscape (AOL) does not provide any more resources for QA. </p>
This component is completely in the hands of the contributor community
now. Many individuals lend their time in the network related
components. They are too many to name individually, but their help is
always appreciated, and if you hang around the various components
enough, you will find out who they are. Additionally, we would, at some
point, like to get interested individuals to own specific areas of
Networking (like Proxy, PAC, and URLs).
<p>Networking standards bugs live in certain bugzilla components, but
are logically subdivided into the following:
<table width="75%" cols="2" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Technology</td>
      <td>Default QA contact</td>
      <td valign="top">Specialists<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>URLs (schemes, parsing, routing)</td>
      <td>benc</td>
      <td valign="top">andreas.otte@debitel.net<br>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Needs a QA contact: <br>
Gopher, SOCKS, PAC, IPv6, Finger<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Who's components depend on Network QA?</b> <br>
browser-general, mailnews, installer, PSM, XP apps (Reload button, back
&amp; forward, offline-online, save and download file, view source.). </p>
<p>These components are not part of Necko engineering, and not directly
tested by Networking Standards QA. <br>
We support the other QA groups in two ways: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Networking problems in these components are often reported in
(or moved to) "Networking" as part of problem analysis.<br>
  </li>
Networking QA will triage incoming bugs and attempt to route them
to the correct component.<br>
  <br>
  <li> Networking problems in these components often utilize basic
networking,&nbsp; DNS or Proxy servers.</li>
Networking QA will provide technically support (test systems and
problem analysis) so these networking problems can be resolved quickly.
</ol>
<b>Why are bugs QA assigned to the way they are?</b> <br>
Engineering assignment of bugs is strongly typed to the component
that needs to be fixed. Generally, an open bug (anything which is not
Status=VERIFIED) should be owned by the QA contact of the current
component.
<p>Most exceptions are because the bug has been moved around during QA
triage or engineering assignment, and the component or QA was not set
correctly. Valid exceptions should have a note in the body of the
record. </p>
<p><b>Who does release notes?<br>
</b>Historically, Networking QA has managed the drafting of release
notes. More on this later.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Ben's current goals</b>:<br>
Clear Verification list (bugs marked Resolved/&lt;anything&gt;) <br>
Develop test server capabilities - start with a list of hardware and
software. <br>
Write and publish test cases for my components. </p>
<p><b>Mozilla projects: </b><br>
streamlined code verification protocol.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Priorities: <br>
</b>Verify resolved/fixed -&gt; Relnotes <br>
Comprehensive bug audit/test case re-write. </p>
<p><b>To Do:</b><br>
Generic test plans <br>
Functional test plans <br>
Isolate URL code entry points <br>
Non-necko functional test plans <br>
Proxy futures <br>
Omni-spoofing DNS/routing reverse proxy buster <br>
