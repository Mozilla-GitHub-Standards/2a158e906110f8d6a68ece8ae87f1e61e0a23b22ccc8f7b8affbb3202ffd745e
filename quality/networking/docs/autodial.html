<h1>Mozilla Autodial Helper Feature for Windows NT</h1>
   
<h2>Introduction</h2>
  This document is intended to explain how the autodial helper feature implemented
for <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93002">Bug 93002</a>
works and why it works that way. <br>
   
<h2>A Brief History of Autodial on Windows</h2>
  In the consumer versions of Windows, (Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME)
 autodial for all applications is controlled from the Control Panel, in the
<i>Internet Options</i> applet, under the tab <i>Connections</i>. If you
turn on the autodial feature, Windows will automatically dial whenever any
application tries to access a network address that can't be reached. Technically,
this control panel applet (Internet Options) is part of Internet Explorer.
It is not present in early versions of Windows until Internet Explorer is
installed. Despite this fact, the feature is triggered by any application
that uses networking.<br>
 <br>
  Starting with Windows NT, and in all NT-based versions (Windows NT, Windows
2000, and Windows XP, including XP Home) Microsoft has changed the behavior
of autodial. For these OSs, the autodial options found in the Internet Options
control panel applet only apply to Microsoft applications, including Internet
Explorer and Outlook. Microsoft added a Windows System Service (Remote Access
Auto Connection) to handle autodial for all other applications. If this service
is running, and Control Panel | Network Connections | Advanced | Dialup Preferences
is set to enable autodial, then any application trying to access the Internet
will trigger the autodial feature whenever an Internet address cannot be reached.
However, this service will won't function if you have a LAN card installed,
unless that particular address has been accessed in the past via a dialup
connection.<br>
   
<h2>Origin of the Bug</h2>
  Before the implementation of the Autodial Helper feature, Mozilla would
trigger the autodial feature on NT-based operating systems, but only if certain
conditions are met. These conditions are as follows:<br>
   
<ol>
    <li>The autodial service is running</li>
  <li>Control Panel | Network Connections | Advanced | Dialup Preferences
| Enable autodial by location is set for some location<br>
  </li>
    <li>A dialup connection has been configured</li>
    <li>There is no LAN connected OR The dialup connection has been used to
 access the Internet address in question.</li>
   
</ol>
  Most systems are not set up correctly for this to happen, and most users
 have no idea how all these details work. So, as more people move to Windows
 XP from Windows 98, the autodial suddenly stops working for them. In fact,
it's not Mozilla that is broken, it's that Microsoft has changed the way
things work from Windows 98 to Windows XP. <br>
 <br>
  In an attempt to help users who want to use the autodial feature of the
OS, I added the Autodial Helper Feature requested in <a
 href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93002">Bug 93002</a>.<br>
   
<h2>How the Feature Works</h2>
 This feature doesn't do anything on Linux, Mac, or the consumer versions
of Windows.<br>
 <br>
 The "correct" way too use the autodial feature in NT-based OSs is for the
user to configure the system to use the autodial service. If the user has
a modem and no LAN card, this service will work reliably for them. Whenever
an Internet address cannot be reached, because of a DNS lookup failure for
example, the system will try to dial. However, if the user has both a modem
and a LAN card, the service will be less reliable for them. The only way
the service will work in this case is if the Internet address has been accessed
some previous time via the modem. These addresses are stored in an OS database,
the RAS Autodial Addresses db, and a <a
 href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q164249">set
 of heuristics</a> are used to determine if an address is already in the database
 or not. Essentially, if some address at domain.com is in the database, then
 any address at domain.com is considered to be in the database. Also, if
any  address that starts with www is in the database, then any other address
that  begins with www is considered to be in the database. It is important
to note  that the function of this system service in no way depends on the
settings  found in Control Panel | Internet Options | Connections.<br>
 <br>
  Since the service is the correct way to use autodial for these OSs, the
first part of the fix to this bug is to help users of the service. Generally,
if the service is running, and an address can't be reached, the autodial
helper adds the address to the RAS Autodial Address db. The next time this
address is tried and can't be found, the autodial service will be triggered
and dialup will commence.<br>
 <br>
  Many Windows XP users, especially Windows XP Home users, don't understand
 that Microsoft has changed how autodial works. To them it looks like Mozilla
 is broken because Windows doesn't try to dial when the feature is turned
on in Control Panel | Internet Options | Connections when they are using Mozilla
but it does when they are using Internet Explorer. "What's a system service"
they might ask when told about how autodial is supposed to work now.<br>
 <br>
  The second part of this fix is for those users. We try to mimic the autodial
 system service if it is not running and the user has the autodial feature
 turned on in Control Panel | Internet Options | Connections. If an address
 can't be reached, we trigger the autodial features from inside Mozilla. If
 a default dialup connection is configured, we use that one. If more than
one dialup connection is configured, and none is selected as the default,
we display a list of dialup connections and let the user choose one.<br>
 
<h2>How to Configure Autodial on NT-based Systems</h2>
 First, you will need to configure a dialup connection and make sure it works
when triggered manually.<br>
 <br>
 If you are using a system with just a modem, the best approach is to configure
the Remote Access Auto Connection service to automatically start. Then enable
autodial for a dialup connection: Control Panel | Network Connections | Advanced
| Dialup Preferences. This will handle autodial whenever an address can't
be found.<br>
 <br>
 If you are using a system with both a LAN and a modem connection, and you
want to use the autodial feature whenever you are not connected to the LAN,
it's probably better to use the Control Panel | Internet Options | Connections
options. &nbsp;Select "Dial whenever a network connection is not present"
or "Always dial my default connection". These two behave the same for Mozilla,
and trigger autodial when you fail to reach a requested address.<br>
 
<h2>Issues</h2>
 There have been a few bug reports filed against this new feature that are
the result of the fact that Mozilla now looks at the Control Panel | Internet
Options | Connections settings. Some users have had the autodial setting
turned on, but Mozilla never triggered them before. Starting in Mozilla 1.1,
autodial is triggered whenever an address can't be reached (Mozilla now mimics
the Remote Access Autodial service.) See <a
 href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162471">Bug 162471</a>,
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167483">Bug 167483</a>,
and <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=160846">Bug 160846</a>.
If a user doesn't want the OS to use autodial, he must turn off the feature
from the OS. <br>
 <br>
 There is also a problem with the AOL client when used as a dialer. <a
 href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166134">Bug 166134</a>
describes how the AOL client installs itself as a dialer, but it doesn't
behave like other dialers. The problem is with the AOL client, be the bug
could probably be fixed by not changing Mozilla to avoid using the AOL client
as a dialer even though it installs itself as one.<br>
 <br>
 A parallel feature has been requested in <a
 href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=106044">Bug 130774</a>:
if we trigger the autodial connection, we should ask the user if he wants
to hang up the connection when we close Mozilla.<br>
 <br>
 There also has been some confusion about what online/offline means. In Mozilla,
it means try to access the network or not. To some users, it means connected
to a network or not. Some people expect an option to toggle online/offline
should trigger dialup or disconnect. This is a misunderstanding of this mode.
Hanging up a dialup connection should not cause Mozilla to go into offline
mode. Making a dialup connection should not cause Mozilla to go into online
mode.<br>
 
<h2>A Pref to Disable</h2>
 Users can bypass the feature altogether by setting the pref<tt> network.autodial-helper.enabled</tt>
to <i>false</i>. Since the feature was implemented close to the release of
Netscape 7, the pref was added so that we could include the feature in the
7.0 release with the feature turned off and enable it in specific cases.
The feature was turned on in Mozilla 1.1 to get more exposure. Mozilla 1.1
also includes a fix to <a
 href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157733">Bug 157733</a>,
which allows our interaction with the autodial service to work a little more
reliably. I don't see a need to expose this pref in the UI, but perhaps it
should be there. Or pehaps we should assume Mozilla users can configure the
autodial service and disable the helper by default, but Netscape users need
a little more help, and enable it for them.<br>
