  <h3><a name="description" id="description">1.Component</a></h3>

  <p>Plugins functionality must be tested across all supported
  platforms(subject to plugin availability). It is not the responsibility of
  Netscape QA to verify that third-party plug-ins are inherently bug-free; this
  is the responsibility of the plug-in vendors. However, the plug-in API has
  been rewritten in Nav6 with the following goals (testable propositions):</p>

  <p>(A) Existing Nav4 generation plug-in binaries which functioned in Nav4
  should continue to function in Nav6.</p>

  <p>(B) <em>Corollary to A:</em> plug-in content which could be viewed using a
  Nav4 generation plug-in should also be viewable in Nav6 using the same
  plug-in binary.</p>

  <p><em>Exception to A and B:</em> If plug-in content makes calls to the
  plug-in's Java/native interface from JavaScript via LiveConnect, these calls
  will fail silently when the Nav4-generation plug-in binary is used within
  Nav6.</p>

  <p>(C) Once a plug-in has been upgraded to support the Nav6 plug-in API the
  upgraded plug-in binary should be 100% functional (for both ordinary and
  LiveConnect content) in Nav6.</p>

  <p>(D) Once a plug-in has been upgraded to support the Nav6 plug-in API
  <em>including support for the backward adapter,</em> the upgraded plug-in
  binary should be 100% functional (for both ordinary and LiveConnect content)
  in both Nav4 <em>and</em> Nav6.</p>

  <p>Here are the combinations represented as a table:</p>

  <table frame="border">
    <tr>
      <th>plugin binary designed for this browser version:</th>

      <th>Browser Version (Nav4)</th>

      <th>Browser Version (Nav6)</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Nav4</td>

      <td>n/a</td>

      <td>Case (A): Nav4 plug-in running in Nav6 works except for LiveConnect
      calls.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Nav6</td>

      <td>Case (D): If upgraded plug-in includes backward adapter, plug-in
      binary should work perfectly including LiveConnect calls in Nav4.</td>

      <td>Case (C): Upgraded plug-in running in Nav6 works including
      LiveConnect calls.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Netscape must verify that the Nav6 plug-in architecture has achieved goals
  A-D. We will do this using a representative sample of popular plug-ins and
  content. Once we have proven that the architecture indeed enables goals A-D
  as intended, plug-in vendors will be able to upgrade their plug-ins on their
  own.</p>

  <h3><a name="whatwill" id="whatwill">2.Areas To Be Tested</a></h3>

  <p><strong>Component Features</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>plug-in launching in external window as a helper app (e.g. RealPlayer
    in its own window) vs. plug-in embedded within the page (e.g. RealAudio
    content embedded in a web page and playing without launching an external
    window)</li>

    <li>when embedded within a page

      <ul>
        <li>EMBED tag for backward compatibility and OBJECT tag for HTML 4.0
        compliance</li>

        <li>standard content, standard content with embedded URLs to display in
        browser (RealPlayer case), and LiveConnect-enabled content</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>plug-in (RealPlayer, Flash, QuickTime ...)</li>

    <li>plug-in version (designed for Nav4, designed for Nav6)</li>

    <li>browser version (Nav4 plug-in running in Nav6, upgraded Nav6 plug-in
    running in Nav6, Nav6 plug-in running in Nav4 via backward adapter)</li>

    <li>platform (Win32, MacOS, Linux -- in theory all tests should be
    performed on all 3 platforms, subject to plug-in availability)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Related Areas :</h4>

  <p>With the recent addition of different 'themes' to mozilla, all tests for
  Plugins should be run on all themes. The Plugins QA will be responsible to
  test plugins under all available themes.</p>

  <h4>New Features For Mach V Release:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Plug-in Finder changes</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>We are moving toward all Gecko based clients being xpi enabled.</p>

  <p>All Netscape based clients up to this point (N 4.x, 6.0 - 6.2.1, 0.9.4
  branch) have used a hard coded cgi for the plug-in finder service, which
  is:<br>
  <a href=
  "http://cgi.netscape.com/cgi-bin/plug-in_finder.cgi?mimetype=[something ]">http://cgi.netscape.com/cgi-bin/plug-in_finder.cgi?mimetype=[something
  ]</a></p>

  <p>Based on this cgi, we have a back-end system that handles mimetype
  requests and sends users to a variety of places to download their plug-in. It
  is the goal going forward to make this a much better user experience, so the
  user doesn't have to surf all around the web to find the plug-in, then
  download it, then install it, then go back to the original webpage to view
  the content.</p>

  <p>Instead the ideal experience is as seamless as possible to the user:</p>

  <p>user clicks on the puzzle piece plug-in is found, downloaded, and
  installed<br>
  original page is refreshed, and embedded content is displayed</p>

  <p>Going forward for Mach V, and the two main embedding projects (CS and AOL)
  we will be using a new cgi program to change the plug-ins program from being
  focused on sending users to the right web pages, to sending them to the right
  .xpi binary.</p>

  <p>To recap some earlier meetings, some of the things that need to happen for
  us to get there:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dan Veditz</strong> is working on enabling xpi in the embedding
    trunk. This should be landing soon.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Peter Lubczynski</strong> is/was going to land some code in the
      trunk that enables the client to pass additional information besides the
      legacy info like mimetype, file extension, etc. to the server side
      script. Most notably:

      <ul>
        <li>xpinstall parameter</li>

        <li>plugins url</li>

        <li>plugins page</li>

        <li>domain name</li>

        <li>others?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>By passing plugins url, plugins page, and domain name, we will have the
    *option* of not only honoring the content developer's EMBED tags in certain
    situations, but we would be able to gain extremely valuable tracking data
    to effectively evangelize the most important plug-in vendors.

      <ul>
        <li>The best example of when it would be good to honor the content
        developer's EMBED tag (that I can think of), is if there is a
        PLUGINSURL that points to an xpi binary with a vendor's domain name
        that differs from the xpi that we (Netscape/AOL/CS) have in our
        database file due to a mime-type conflict.</li>

        <li>The key thing to note is not necessarily the merit or how common an
        example like the above would be, but rather it gives us lots of options
        on how we can handle plug-ins requests.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>New cgi's for all clients after the 0.9.8 milestone, developed by Ray
    Gerst in Web Development, could be something like:

      <ul>
        <li>if xpi available, call xpi-plug-in_finder.cgi

          <ul>
            <li>searches the database file for location of xpi binary and sends
            user there.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>else, call no-xpi-plug-in_finder.cgi

          <ul>
            <li>no-xpi-plug-in_finder.cgi could do a number of things
            like:</li>

            <li>send the user to a non-xpi binary (.exe)</li>

            <li>honor the embed tag</li>

            <li>send the user to an Netscape/AOL/CS branded webpage with
            mime-type or file extension search results (similar to existing
            system)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Regular Metrics reporting will be essential to this program's success.
    Most common plug-ins vary tremendously between Netscape and AOL/CS users.
    Being able differentiate between the brands and develop the right
    relationships with vendors will be key. Dave Barrowman put together a good
    start for data mining opportunities for the plug-in finder service.

      <ul>
        <li>It is posted at: <a href=
        "http://client.mcom.com/Komodo/PF_Data_Mining.html">http://client.mcom.com/Komodo/PF_Data_Mining.html</a></li>

        <li><strong>Ray Gerst</strong> is the most likely candidate for
        developing a reporting tool.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Creating a tool that wraps a regular binary with an xpi script.

      <ul>
        <li>For vendors that are slow to adopt xpi or who don't want to create
        a full blown xpi installer, it would be a very good thing to create a
        tool that could do this either automatically for them or for us.</li>

        <li>It would reduce the strain on both the evangelism team, and the
        engineering team if we need to do this in-house.</li>

        <li>Who could develop this? Peter L? Dan V? XPInstall team? other?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="whatwillnot" id="whatwillnot">3.What Will Not Be Tested</a></h3>

  <p>Basically, it is the responsibility of plugin vendors to provide upgraded
  plugins compatible to mozilla 6.0 plugin api. Any plugin other than the major
  ones like shockwave, flash, realplayer, acrobat, quicktime will not be
  thoroughly tested and QA'ed. Once a vendor comes up with a mozilla compatible
  plugin, we can use it to test with mozilla.</p>

  <h3>4.<a name="approach" id="approach">Approach</a></h3>

  <p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>

  <p>Plugins testing should basically cover all major plugins identified by
  Netscape as crucial ones. This includes shockwave player, flash, realplayer,
  adobe acrobat and quicktime. Since there are no plugins released by the
  plugin vendors for the upgraded mozilla api, latest versions of all plugins
  will be used and tested for backward compatibility. Existing binaries will
  work as-is within Nav6, and existing content which uses the plug-in will work
  fine. Exception: if the plug-in offers an API callable from JavaScript and
  content calls that API, the JavaScript call will fail unless the vendor has
  upgraded their plug-in to support the Nav6 plug-in API and the user has
  installed this Nav6-ready version. The Nav6 plug-in API enables existing
  content (including JavaScript calls) to work unchanged in Nav6 as well as
  previous browser versions.</p>

  <p>Plugins will be tested as embedded within the browser window and also as
  helper applications (Realplayer). Testcases should be written to cover all
  major plugins identified. These tests should basically cover all the
  essential functionality of the plugins. Bugs shall be written up in bugzilla
  for the problem that are observed by QA during testing. Plugins will be
  tested as per platform availability. We should achieve the goals as mentioned
  in section 1 of the test plan.</p>

  <p><strong>Automation</strong></p>

  <p>At present, no automation is being used for testing purposes.</p>

  <p><strong>Acceptance Testing</strong></p>

  <p>For Shockwave:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Load <a href="http://www.oddcast.com/">www.oddcast.com</a></li>

    <li>Load <a href=
    "http://www.powershot.com/splash.html">www.powershot.com/splash.html</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>For Realplayer:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>(Plugin)Load <a href=
    "http://www.prometheus-music.com/gecko/plugtest3.html">Test1</a></li>

    <li>(Helper App) Load <a href=
    "http://www.netwiz.net/~cryan/realaudio.html">Test2</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>For Quicktime:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Go to www.quicktime.com and play any movie clip</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Functional and Usability Testing</strong></p>

  <p><strong>RealPlayer:</strong></p>

  <p>(A) Existing Nav4 generation plug-in binaries which functioned in Nav4
  should continue to function in Nav6.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>plug-in launching in external window as helper app</li>

    <li>RealPlayer</li>

    <li>plug-in embedded within web page</li>

    <li>via EMBED tag</li>

    <li>via OBJECT tag</li>

    <li>standard content</li>

    <li>standard content with embedded URLs for display within the browser</li>
  </ul>

  <p>0) In Nav6, make sure you have RealPlayer version ___ (pre Nav6-upgrade)
  installed.<br>
  1) Open <a href=
  "http://blues/users/ekrock/publish/bugs/M9/ecxpert.html">http://blues/users/ekrock/publish/bugs/M9/ecxpert.html</a><br>

  2) Verify that clip begins playing, embedded within browser window.<br>
  Note: This test is a simplified test case derived from the next one</p>

  <p>1) Open <a href=
  "http://media.netscape.com/launch.html#ECXpert">http://media.netscape.com/launch.html#ECXperti</a><br>

  2) Click "Launch ECXpert" button.<br>
  3) Verify that clip begins playing, embedded within browser window. (Don't
  touch the button controls; some of them use LiveConnect, and we test that in
  a later step.)</p>

  <p>1) Open <a href=
  "http://media.netscape.com/launch.html#css1">http://media.netscape.com/launch.html#css1</a><br>

  2) Click "Launch CSS1" button.<br>
  3) Verify that clip begins playing, embedded within browser window, and that
  every few minutes the HTML page displayed within the right frame changes.
  (Don't touch the button controls; some of them use LiveConnect, and we test
  that in a later step.)</p>

  <p><strong>Note: This test can only be performed after RealNetworks releases
  a RealPlayer upgraded for Nav6.</strong><br>
  (C) Once a plug-in has been upgraded to support the Nav6 plug-in API,
  including support for the backward adapter, the upgraded plug-in binary
  should be 100% functional (for both ordinary and LiveConnect content) in
  Nav6.</p>

  <p>0) In Nav6, make sure you have RealPlayer G2 version ___ (post
  Nav6-upgrade) installed. Test the following:<br>
  1) Open <a href=
  "http://media.netscape.com/launch.html#ECXpert">http://media.netscape.com/launch.html#ECXperti</a><br>

  2) Click "Launch ECXpert" button.<br>
  3) Wait for audio to begin playing.<br>
  4) Once audio has begun playing, select "Customer Stories" from pulldown menu
  on left. Verify that presentation continues playing from the "Customer
  Stories" section. This confirms that the JavaScript LiveConnect call
  document.audioclip.SetPosition(<em>msec</em>) succeeded.</p>

  <p><strong>Note: This test can only be performed after RealNetworks releases
  a RealPlayer upgraded for Nav6 and including support for the backward
  adapter</strong><br>
  (D) Once a plug-in has been upgraded to support the Nav6 plug-in API
  <em>including support for the backward adapter,</em> the upgraded plug-in
  binary should be 100% functional (for both ordinary and LiveConnect content)
  in both Nav4 and Nav6.</p>

  <p>0) In Nav4, make sure you have RealPlayer G2 version ___ (post
  Nav6-upgrade) installed. Test the following:<br>

  section. This confirms that the JavaScript LiveConnect call
  document.audioclip.SetPosition(<em>msec</em>) succeeded.<br></p>

  <p><strong>Flash:</strong></p>

  <p>As far as Eric Krock knows, Flash content never plays in its own
  standalone window as a helper app, so it's not necessary to test that as it
  is for RealPlayer.</p>

  <p>(A) Existing Nav4 generation plug-in binaries which functioned in Nav4
  should continue to function in Nav6.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>plug-in embedded within web page</li>

    <li>via EMBED tag</li>

    <li>via OBJECT tag</li>

    <li>standard content</li>

    <li>Flash</li>
  </ul>

  <p>0) In Nav6, make sure you have Flash version ___ (pre Nav6-upgrade)
  installed.<br>
  1) In Nav6, open <a href=
  "http://www.fridgefashions.com/f4/movie.html">http://www.fridgefashions.com/f4/movie.html</a><br>

  2) Verify that the Flash animation plays and the picture flies up on to the
  refrigerator.</p>

  <h3>6.<a name="contingencies" id="contingencies">CONTINGENCIES</a></h3>

  <p><strong>Loss of Test Machine Resources</strong></p>

  <p>While highly unlikely there is the possibility that Test Machines could
  break down. Planning should be done, by each component area to ensure there
  are reserves of equipment to be drawn upon.</p>

  <p><strong>Bugs</strong></p>

  <p>If outstanding bug counts do not drop and cannot be mitigated between QA,
  Engineering, and Marketing there is the potential that the project schedule
  may have to slip. The time increment will be agreed to by the project leads.</p>

  <p><strong>Builds</strong></p>

  <p>There is the potential for build crisises to arise (tree spammage, etc.)
  which can impact QA and Engineering getting code to use for their work, and
  therefore adversely affect the schedule. Some planning should be done in this area in
  anticipation of the most probable things that could go wrong.</p>
