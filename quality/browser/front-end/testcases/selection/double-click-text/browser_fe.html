	<LI>The Browser QA team has now been divided into two smaller teams: the Brower Standards
	Compliance team, and the Browser/Composer Front-End QA team. As the Front-End QA
	team, we're chartered with testing the areas of the Mozilla browser with which users
	directly interact, excluding page layout and rendering.  <FONT SIZE="2"><B>[10.14.99]</B></FONT>

<P>The Browser/Ender QA team wants you, right here, helping us make sure that we
release the best browser and editor on the market. We test a variety of areas, from
checking anchors, to XML, to menus and toolbars. We also have existing test cases
that need to be reviewed and automated - are you a whiz at JavaScript or Perl? There
are many areas where people can help us out. What would you like to help out with?
<H4>Test Case Development:</H4>
<P>Test case development and review is an area where we can always use help. There
are a wide variety of areas to cover and tasks to perform. Here are some specifics:

			<LI>Use your own web pages to test the product. You probably already know how to
			create web pages and know how to design effective, cutting edge pages. Submit bugs
			that you find when viewing your web pages. If you use CSS, XML, or the new HTML 4.0
			elements on your pages, then you will provide us with valuable information. So go
			for it, create some cutting edge pages and see how we stack up to your expectations.
