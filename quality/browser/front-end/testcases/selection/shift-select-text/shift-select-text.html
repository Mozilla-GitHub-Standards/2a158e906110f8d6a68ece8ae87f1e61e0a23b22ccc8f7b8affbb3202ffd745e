        <p><strong>August 22, 1996</strong> - In my previous column I
        talked about how helping other companies succeed is the most
        important part of Netscape's mission. This week I'd like to spend
        some time on the main thing that makes the success of these
        companies possible: open standards software.</p>

        <p>I tend to look at open standards software from the perspective
        of the folks who have to buy and use this stuff: As the former CIO
        of a <em>Fortune</em> 500 company and then as the COO of a number
        of rather large companies, I have bought and implemented more
        system solutions than probably any software CEO on the planet. So
        when we're building products, I can ask questions: If I were buying
        this software, what would I want? What can it do for my
        business?</p>

        <p>Openness means businesses finally have flexibility - we can make
        decisions with more futurity because we don't have to be
        vendor-dependent. No matter how good a vendor is and no matter how
        much I may like their products, I don't want to be beholden to
        them. I can remember when I was a CIO - I'd go to bed at night and
        think, "Well, we brought up another 5000 lines of code that will
        only run on an Aardvark 1." I can tell you, that was not the most
        comforting thought, even though I may have been the world's
        greatest fan of the Aardvark Company.</p>

        <p>I like to have more buying power. I like to have multiple
        choices when I go out to buy things, whether it's a car or a house
        or a boat. Why wouldn't I want to have the same choice when I go
        out to buy software for my computers? I'd like to know that I can
        make any changes next week or next year without having to rebuild
        the entire system.</p>

        <p>For some reason, MIS people seem to be beholden to certain
        database manufacturers, certain operating system manufacturers, and
        certain hardware manufacturers. It's very difficult to change.
        We've allowed ourselves as buyers of computer systems to somehow or
        another believe that a single choice is good just because it's
        easier.</p>

        <p>Well now we can have open systems that are equally easy - and,
        in most cases, even easier. So, everything else being equal, I
        would always choose open systems versus closed and proprietary
        ones. Open software gives me the multiple choices I always want to
        have when I buy something.</p>

        <p>Open software also has low switching costs - I can change from
        one vendor to another very easily, and I can usually do it over a
        heavy-duty weekend. We've always wanted that; we just never had it.
        I can bring up applications much more quickly and therefore less
        expensively than with proprietary products. I get the advantage of
        better products, lower price, and lower switching costs.</p>

        <p>Now everyone and their brother is getting on the open standards
        bandwagon. But hopefully people will always remember that Netscape
        was a leader in getting the software industry to adopt open
        standards much more quickly than it otherwise would have. Where we
        go from here is up to our customers - the people who have let us
        know, through their support, what's important to them and why the
        industry needed to move in this direction. We're dedicated to
        building good products that meet real needs and help our customers
        solve real problems.</p>

        <p>Netscape is a good choice. You can feel safe with us. We don't
        believe anybody is going to own this new world of open software. If
        they could, then it isn't open - by definition. The playing field
        is going to be as open as the product lines. Users will have
        multiple choices - and that's the best thing that ever could have
        happened for them. We're going to work very diligently in our
        little piece of the world to make our products and services the
        best they can be. But the good news to you is, if you decide we
        aren't worth your trust and money, you can quickly switch to
        another vendor. It may cost you a long weekend, but nothing more.
        Not only that, you can also mix and match products from multiple
        vendors to come up with custom solutions fitted to the needs of
        your employees, your customers, and your IS departments.</p>

        <p>So instead of lying in bed at night wondering what your support
        of the Aardvark Company is costing you, hopefully you'll be
        sleeping and dreaming about all the great open systems you can
        build.</p>
