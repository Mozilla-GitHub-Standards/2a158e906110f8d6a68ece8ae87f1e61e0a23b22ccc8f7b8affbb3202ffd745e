        <p>Currently working on plugging in an XSL processor into Gecko.
        The processor was recently contributed by Keith Visco (MITRE) to
        mozilla.org (I have been interacting with Keith for some time and
        he got the go ahead to MPL his source just a week or so back).
        Gecko has hooks that let an external XSLT processor apply an XSL
        transformation to an XML document before it is displayed. I'll try
        to demo the plugged in processer at XML DevCon '99 in Canada this
        Friday. If I can't get it plugged in by then, I'll at least talk
        about the XSL hooks in Gecko. I really want to get the XSL
        processor hooked up by beta, though.</p>

        <p>* We use James Clark's expat parser for parsing XML documents.
        Till now, almost all the bugs related to XML have been related to
        the layers above expat and the few that were expat related were
        killed by James Clark in no time. He is an ideal module owner. I'll
        be doing more XML bug fixing till beta. Most of the current bugs
        are related to the new external parameter entity support that went
        in recently to support localization of XUL files.</p>

        <p>* The xml, xul, rdf content sinks' code needs to be factored
        better by beta. Vidur and Peter Linss are owning this and I'll be
        helping out.</p>

        <p>* The error strings reported by expat need to be localized. -
        the xml documentation on mozilla.org is badly in need of an update.
        I wanna get to do that after the upcoming XML conference.</p>

        <p>* It would be really cool to wrap expat with XPCOMified SAX
        interfaces. That would create an XP alternative to Microsoft's
        COMified XML parser component.</p>
