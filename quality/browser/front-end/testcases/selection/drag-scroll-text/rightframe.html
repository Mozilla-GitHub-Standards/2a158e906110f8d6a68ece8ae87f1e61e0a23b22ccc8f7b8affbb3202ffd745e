  <h1>How to Write a Useful Bug Report</h1>

  <p>Useful bug reports are ones that get bugs fixed. A useful bug report
  normally has two qualities:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Reproducible.</strong> If an engineer can't see it or
    conclusively prove that it exists, the engineer will probably stamp it
    "WORKSFORME" or "INVALID", and move on to the next bug. Every detail
    you can provide helps.</li>

    <li><strong>Specific.</strong> The quicker the engineer can trace
    down the issue to a specific problem, the more likely it'll be fixed
    expediently. If you're crashing on a site, please take the time to
    isolate what on the page is triggering the crash, and include it as an
    HTML snippet in the bug report if possible.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>(Specific bugs have the added bonus of remaining relevant when an
  engineer actually gets to them; in a rapidly changing web, a bug report
  of "foo.com crashes my browser" becomes meaningless after the site
  experiences a half-dozen redesigns and hundreds of content changes.)</p>

  <p>Let's say you crash at foo.com, and want to write up a bug
  report:</p>

  <p><strong>BAD:</strong> "Mozilla crashed. I think I was on foo.com. My
  computer uses Windows. I think that this is a really bad problem and you
  should fix it now."</p>

  <p><strong>GOOD:</strong> "I crashed each time when I went to foo.com,
  using the 2.28.99 build of Seamonkey on a Win NT 4.0 (Service Pack 3)
  system. I also rebooted into Linux, and reproduced this problem using the
  2.28.99 Linux build.</p>

  <p>Apprunner crashed each time upon drawing the Foo banner at the top of
  the page. I broke apart the page, and discovered that the following image
  link will crash Apprunner reproducibly, unless you remove the "border=0"
  attribute:</p>

  <p>&lt;img src="http://foo.com/images/topics/topicfoos.gif" width="34"
  height="44" border="0" alt="News"&gt;"</p>

  <p>We'd also recommend reviewing a few of the better bug reports, such as
  <span class="c1">2683</span>, <span class="c1">3092</span> or
  <span class="c1">4044</span>. Bug submissions that do not meet these
  "Useful Bug Report" criteria tend to be investigated on a time-available
  basis.</p>
