  <h1>Who We Are and What We Do</h1>

  <p>Mozilla Quality Assurance (QA) is a network of countless volunteers
  from the net community and several dozen Netscape employees. We share the
  common mission of <strong>taming the lizard through finding and
  constructively reporting relevant bugs in mozilla.org open source
  projects</strong>.</p>

  <p>We typically <strong>find bugs</strong> by discovering the ways in
  which the Mozilla client software's actual behavior deviates from the
  expected behavior, as determined by specifications from the W3C, IETF,
  Netscape, and other such organizations.</p>

  <p>We typically <strong>report bugs</strong> by researching and writing
  reproducible and specific bug reports in <span class=
  "c1">Bugzilla</span>, the Mozilla bug tracking system.</p>

  <h2>Why Should I Get Involved?</h2>

  <p>To quote Eric S. Raymond, "<span class="c1">Given enough eyeballs, all
  bugs are shallow.</span>"</p>

  <p>Opportunities to contribute abound for those who may not write
  software, but who wish to exercise the daily Mozilla builds and
  constructively report the bugs that they discover. Bugs reported by the
  rest of the world receive equal attention to the bugs submitted by
  Netscape employees.</p>

  <p>By joining Mozilla QA, you can contribute to placing a fast, stable,
  and truly standards-compliant browser and mail/news reader onto the hard
  disks of tens of millions of Internet users, even without writing a
  single line of code.</p>

  <h2>How Can I Contribute?</h2>

  <p>Right now, you can contribute by rigorously exercising the daily
  builds, and reporting reproducible bugs in <span class=
  "c1">Bugzilla</span>. Mozilla QA is gearing up to publish Netscape's
  internal browser test case suites onto mozilla.org, and to host a library
  of Netscape and Net Community test case suites.</p>
