<BODY>
   <H2>Frame Home Page</H2>
   <P>This window should be divided into two vertical frames. There should be a frame border between the two vertical frames. The left vertical frame is set to noresize, consequently no scroll bar should be displayed between the two vertical frames even though scrolling is set to auto. The right vertical frame should have two horizontal frames. The upper frame, named "frm-bhd," has been set to noresize, therefore the frame should be of a fixed size. In addition, the scrolling option has been set to no, there should be no vertical or horizontal scroll bars. The bottom frame, named "frm-bdy-bdy," may be resized and scroll bars will be available if the frame size does not display all of the frame text.</P>
   <P>The set up for this page is this:</P>

  <PRE>

&lt;FRAMESET COLS="20%,80%"&gt;

     &lt;FRAME SRC="bft_frame_navpanel1.html" NAME="navpanel" NORESIZE SCROLLING=auto&gt;
     &lt;FRAMESET ROWS="25%,75%"&gt;
         &lt;FRAME SRC="bft_frame_header.html" NAME="frm-bhd" NORESIZE SCROLLING=no&gt;
         &lt;FRAME SRC="bft_frame_body.html" NAME="frm-bdy-bdy" SCROLLING=auto&gt;

     &lt;/FRAMESET&gt;

&lt;/FRAMESET&gt;
