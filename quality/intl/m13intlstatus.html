<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="genprefs"></a><b>Preferences/Installer:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">The Mac installer for the M13 binary could be very
slow compared to Windows and Unix builds -- please be patient.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FF0000">There is very little need to directly edit Preferences
file, </font><b><font color="#000000">prefs.js.</font></b><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;</font>
Both <b>profile migration</b> and <b>new profile creation</b> are very
easy to accomplish with the improved Profile Manager. Users who have had
trouble setting up Mail server(s) before should try <b>Edit | Account Setup</b>
menu available in the Messenger window.</li>

<li>
Mozilla can migrate Communicator 4.x profiles you have on your system.
Choose an existing one made by 4.x from the list and a new one will be
created for Mozilla.</li>

<ul>
<li>
The window for profile migration will appear the first time you start a
new Mozilla build after the installation.</li>

<li>
If it does not, you can start with the profile manager: <b>mozilla -installer
(Unix &amp; Win).&nbsp; </b>Mac users can start with the <b>Mozilla Profile
Manager</b> file.</li>
</ul>

<li>
If you have used an earlier version of Mozilla, we recommend that you delete
the file called <b>mozregistry.dat (Win)/Mozilla registry (Mac)/registry
(Unix) </b>before you run M13 Mozilla. (Don't delete <b>Netscape Registry</b>file
for Mac, which is for Communicator 4.x.). We recommend this procedure because
during an earlier Milestone, i.e. M10, there has been a change in the way
registry works and the old registry prior to M9 will not work well with
builds later than M9. Read the section in the Release Notes called
<b>Files
Used or Created</b> to find out where you can find these files.</li>

<li>
When you start M13 after having deleted <b>mozregistry.dat or registry,
</b>you
will be asked to create a new profile. If you name an existing profile,
that profile will be used. Otherwise "Default" profile called "mozProfile"
will be created. If this latter happens, you can replace the <b>prefs.js</b>
file in the Default folder with the one from an existing profile directory.
(Note that
<b>the default profile name</b> changed from <b>prefs50.js</b>
(of M8 and earlier) to <b>prefs.js </b>starting with M9.)</li>

<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Note on non-ASCII path names: </font></b><font color="#000000">For
both Profile manager and Mail/News Account setup manager, it would be best
to avoid choosing folder or path names which contain non-ASCII characters
at this point. Internationalization of these is not complete yet. (Mail/News
Account names in non-ASCII display OK, however.)</font></li>

<li>
Also read the Installation instructions for your platform carefully in
this Release Notes.</li>
</ul>
<b><font size=+1>Browser:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Performance</b>: Generally speaking, M13 should be quite usable as as
a daily browser for international users. Note some of the bugs described
in this section, however.</li>

<li>
<b>Copy/Paste: </b>Copy/Paste operation of non-ASCII data is working more
or less well in M13 within Mozilla with the exception of Mac which currently
has a problem of copying from the Browser window. See below in the Editor
section for details.</li>

<li>
<b>Window Title display of non-ASCII:</b> Due to a dependency on platform
specific widgets, currently Mozilla cannot display Window titles (Browser,
Editor, Messenger, etc.) if they contain non-ASCII characters not supported
by the operating system. For example, Korean titles will display OK under
Korean OSs but not under Japanese Windows, etc.</li>

<li>
<b>Sidebar: </b>You should be able to display non-ASCII names here, e.g.
Related sites. Sometimes display of non-ASCII names may be corrupt. There
are a few bugs on this problem. See Bugs <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24557">24557</a>,
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24933">24933</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Bookmarks: </b>Bookmarks titles support non-ASCII characters. (Note:
IE favorites are not imported correctly yet and will not display non-ASCII
characters well. See Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6770">6770</a>.)</li>

<li>
<b>Accept-Language: </b>Backend work for Accept-Language was completed
in M13. The Pref UI is not done yet but Mozilla now sends out Accept-Language
values in an HHTP header when the following line exists in <b>prefs.js:
</b>e.g.&nbsp;<b>
user_pref("intl.accept_languages", "ja,en"); </b>. The language values
(<b>ja</b> and <b>en</b> in the formula) should be from
<a href="http://www.egt.ie/standards/iso639/iso639-1-en.html">ISO-639-1</a>.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="fontprefs"></a><b>Font Preferences:</b> Backend work for font
preferences was completed back in M12. The UI for font preferences now
also exists in M13. Changing fonts through the pref UI does not work yet,
however -- we expect this work to be completed in M14.&nbsp; In the meantime,
font names and sizes can be manipulated by editing <b>prefs.js
</b>file
for all platforms -- in M12, this worked only for Windows.&nbsp; Here are
some highlights of new font preferences at M13. Font work is not finished
yet and some of these specs might change later.</li>

<ul>
<li>
The font preferences can now be set for 5 generic font families: <b>serif,
sans-serif, monospace, cursive </b>and<b> fantasy</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Mozilla does not map non-generic font family names such as "Times", "Courier",
and "Arial" to corresponding CJK fonts. Web page designers should use generic
font names if this is the desired result.</li>
</ul>

<li>
The font preferences are in principle set for language/script groups (except
for Unicode) rather than for charsets as was done in Communicator 4.x.</li>

<li>
The font size can be set for: <b>variable</b> or <b>fixed</b>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>variable</b> setting only controls the <b>default HTML display</b> which
is set by the following line:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>user_pref("font.default", "sans-serif");</b>&nbsp; -- <b>serif</b> should
be the default and this probably does not have to be set unless you want
to change the HTML display default to <b>sans-serif</b> type. The 2 values
most often used for this HTML display default would be <b>serif </b>or
<b>sans-serif</b>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>fixed</b> setting only affects <b>monospace</b> font setting. e.g. mail
message viewing.</li>

<li>
The <b>font sizes </b>are measured in <b>pixels</b> rather than in <b>points</b>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
These preferences will be consulted to select fonts to use in case the
page you are visiting does not have fonts specified.</li>

<li>
Non-ASCII font names are also supported. We don't have the UI working yet
for setting fonts but you can play with non-ASCII font names and font sizes
by editing <b>prefs.js</b>. Be careful, however, because prefs.js must
be in UTF-8 if it contains any non-ASCII characters. UTF-8 editor is hard
to find. Japanese font names are known to work on Japanese Windows95/98/NT4
and on Macintosh. Font<font color="#000000"> names to use are the same
ones found in Control Panel | Fonts for Windows, Key Caps utility for Mac,
and the
<b>font family name</b> for Unix as indicated by the red bold type
in this example. Font names can also contain spaces.:</font></li>

<p><br><font color="#000000">-adobe-</font><b><font color="#FF0000">courier</font></b><font color="#000000">-medium-o-normal-0-0-75-m-0-iso8859-1</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font color="#FF0000">Help us by trying out the Korean and Chinese font
names under the respective language operating systems. </font>Below is
an illustration on how you might edit prefs.js for font preferences on
Japanese Windows. The key point is that if <b>prefs.js</b> contains non-ASCII
characters, it must be encoded in UTF-8.:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Find your current&nbsp; <b>prefs.js</b> file, and make a backup copy, then
rename the original <b>prefs.js</b> to something like <b>jpprefs.txt</b>.</li>

<li>
Using a text editor like NotePad, edit <b>jpprefs.txt</b> with the following
templates for font names and sizes:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>user_pref("font.name.serif.ja", "Font_name_in_JPN");</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- You can set fonts for each of the 5 font types mentioned below.</li>

<li>
<b>user_pref("font.size.variable.ja", 12);</b>&nbsp; -- sizes are in <b>pixels</b>.&nbsp;
This controls HTML default display.</li>

<li>
<b>user_pref("font.size.fixed.ja", 12); </b>-- sizes are in <b>pixels</b>.&nbsp;
This controls <b>monospace</b> display such as &lt;pre>.. &lt;/pre> text
or Plain Text Mail message display.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Possible font types: <b>serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive </b>and<b>
fantasy</b>.</li>

<li>
Possible language groups are: <b>ja, zh-TW, ko, zh-CN, x-western, x-central-euro,
x-cyrillic, el, tr, x-unicode, zh-TW</b></li>

<li>
Possible font size categories: <b>variable, fixed.</b></li>

<li>
Possible font size: integer in <b>pixels</b>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
For mail message viewing, due to Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26182">26182</a>,
the font types and sizes are currently controlled by <b>x-unicode</b> setting
only rather than based on the language of the message in view. For example,</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>user_pref("font.name.serif.x-unicode", "Font_name_in_JPN");</b> -->
for HTML message display</li>

<li>
<b>user_pref("font.name.monospace.x-unicode", "Font_name_in_JPN"); -->
</b>for Plain Text message display</li>
</ul>

<li>
When inserting font names in Japanese, pay special attention to how the
font names are spelled -- is the alphabet part using full-width Roman?
Is the space half-width or full-width? You can see how the font names are
written by looking in the Windows Control Panel's Font utility program.</li>

<li>
You can also set the screen resolution with the following type of preference
item in <b>prefs.js</b> file.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>user_pref("browser.screen_resolution", 120);</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
Now that you have edited <b>jpprefs.txt </b>using Japanese font names,
you should convert the encoding to UTF-8 using the following command line
utility shipped with Mozilla (Win and Unix only) in the same directory
as the <b>mozilla
</b>executable. See <a href="#utf8convert">below</a>
on details of how to use the conversion utility.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">nsconv -f Shift_JIS -t UTF-8&nbsp; jpprefs.txt prefs.js</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Note: <b>nsconv</b> does not replace an existing
file of the same name -- that's why you should rename the original prefs.js
to something else first.</font></li>
</ul>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Now Mozilla can read the Japanese font names you
specified and reflect your choice.</font></li>
</ul>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Any additional Japanese editing should be done on
</font><b>jpprefs.txt
</b>only.
Then the conversion utility should be used to get the UTF-8 version of
it -- unless you have an editor which can handle UTF-8 data directly.
<b>Note:</b>
On Windows 2000 (currently Beta), editing utilities should be able to save
data into UTF-8. If you know of other such editors, please write to <a href="mailto:momoi@netscape.com">me</a>
and tell me about it.</li>

<li>
None of these hand-editing would be needed when the font UI is done, which
should be coming in M14.</li>

<li>
<b>Unix font display problem and future directions:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Currently the code bases the "line height" always on the Latin 1 font height.
Since other language fonts (e.g. Japanese) could be larger than the Latin-1
fonts on Unix, lines look too close together and even overlap in some cases.
These effects are visible in both UI and HTML display. In the near future,
we will be making a change in such a way as to base the line height based
on the language of the text being displayed. This means that the line height
needs to grow when dealing with Japanese texts, for example. This should
improve the situation considerably.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Big 5 fonts on Unix:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
It is now possible to use Big5 fonts with the suffix <b>big5.et-0</b>.</li>

<li>
<b>Fixed!: Big 5 fonts and Japanese Kana display on Unix: </b>In M12, when
you have Big5 fonts like Taipei on your Unix system, due to a Big5 converter
table error, it led to non-display of Japanese Kana characters. This Bug
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21209">21209</a>
was fixed in M13.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Form: </b>Form submission of non-ASCII data is working generally.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Fixed!: </b>Multipart file upload is now working in M13 --> Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8209">8209</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Fixed!: </b>If a web page form uses JavaScript and escape() function
on form input data, at M12 JS returned unicode data instead of the charset
which matches the web page. This led to incorrect data submission and failure
of search. Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22594">22594</a>.</li>

<li>
There is a bug which shows only blank for non-ASCII data input when the
Back button is pressed on the page which resulted by submitting form data.
Cf. Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22580">22580</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>GFX widget/Ender </b>is <b>ON</b> by default. This means that all input
areas in M13 support non-ASCII character input including input using CJK
IMEs. Read the Editor section below for more information.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>M13 converter(s)</b>: There are no new converters in M13.&nbsp; See
here for <a href="#charlist">a list of all the converters at M13</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Unix charset testing:&nbsp; </b>As mentioned in the M7 Release Notes,
the display for the supported charsets except Armenian, Thai, and Vietnamese
should be working.&nbsp; We would like users to continue to look at various
Unix charsets and <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">file a bug </a>if
a problem is found. The list of the supported charsets at M13 can be found
<a href="#charlist">below</a>.
<font color="#FF0000">Please
download the Unix binary and check out our support for these character
sets.
</font>(Note: You need appropriate fonts to display these languages
-- pcf.gz format on Linux. Visit <a href="http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859.html">this
site</a> for ISO and Cyrillic BDF fonts, and <a href="ftp://ftp.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/intlfonts-1.2-split/">this
site</a> for multi-byte language fonts. If you want to get the entire international
font set, try <a href="ftp://ftp.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/">one directory above</a>
for this file, <b>intlfonts-1.2.tar.gz</b> . For converting from BDF to
PCF format fonts, use <b>bdftopcf</b> utility. Once installed you need
to update the fontsdir, i.e. <b>mkfontdir</b>, and then rehash the font
path, i.e.<b> xset +fp `pwd`</b> .)</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Note: </b>The current Character Set menus (including the name of the
menu itself) are temporary and will be replaced in M14 by a new single
dynamic menu. The new menu specs for the Browser have been published <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/uidocs/browsercharmenu.html">here</a>.
The name "Character Set" will also be replaced by "Character Coding". At
M13, much work has been completed -- according to the specs above --&nbsp;
to make the Character Coding menu dynamic, customizable, and eventually
accommodate new Character sets via a plug-in directory. The dynamic Character
Coding menu will use the Extensibility Model as discussed in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/extensibility-model.html">this
document</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>You will notice that there are 7 Character Set Menus </b>in the Browser
window, and 6 in Composer/Editor and Messenger.</li>

<li>
The first 6 "static" menus with sub-titles such as "ISO" constitute a temporary
workaround for long, non-customizable and non-scrollable menu.</li>

<li>
The 7th Character Set menu -- found only in the Browser window -- is the
dynamic menu which is under development but will replace the workaround
menu in M14. This is the same menu as the first 6 put together. It does
not scroll under Linux and Windows and so you cannot probably see the whole
list except on Mac, but the dynamic menu is created via a script and it
will be customizable.</li>

<li>
Both types of&nbsp; menus should work in M13 and one of them is actually
redundant. This is harmless, however. Character set menus in other components
are still static at this point and you will not see the dynamic menu.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu usage:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
You can switch to different Character set upon encountering a page which
does not have a&nbsp; meta charset tag and which is not displaying correctly.
If you happen to have a charset detector ON and if the display is failing,
you need to first turn OFF the detector setting, and then try the Character
Set menu. Otherwise, the charset detector's choice will always predominate
over the manual menu selection. You will not see a checkmark next to the
menu item yet, however.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="chardet"></a><b>Charset detection modules </b>in the <b>Browser
Menu.</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The charset detection modules for <b>Chinese</b>, <b>Japanese</b>,
<b>Korean</b>,
<b>East
Asian (CJK)</b>, <b>Chinese (Simplified &amp; Traditional Chinese)</b>,
<b>Ukrainian</b>,
and <b>Russian</b> are in a menu below the Character Set menu.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000"><b>Russian &amp; Ukrainian: Crashing</b> bugs reported

</ul>

<li>
You can select 1 charset detection module at a time. Once selected, the
auto detection for the charsets of&nbsp; language(s) you selected will
be ON until you turn it OFF.</li>

The charset detector will be engaged even when you have selected a Character
Set explicitly via the Character Set menu. If you need to override the
effect of the charset detector in effect, choose OFF, and then select a
new Character Set from the Character Set menu. Please use the charset detector
feature for a variety of web pages in the languages of your choice and
let us know how we are doing. File a bug at <font color="#000000"><a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a></font>

Until M10, these charset detectors could be used only by <b>prefs.js</b>
settings. This is no longer necessary since the charset detector menu fulfills
exactly the same function.&nbsp; The menu now controls what gets inserted
into
<b>chardet_name
</b>of:</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>user_pref("intl.charset.detector", "<b>chardet_name</b>");</ul>

<ul>&nbsp;
<br>If the charset detector is OFF, then <b>chardet_name</b> value will
be empty. As reported before, unit testing also can be done via a utility
called "Detectch.exe" found in the same directory as the "mozilla.exe"
file. If you are interested in modifying the prefs.js for charset detector
modules or use the command line utility, read the usage instruction
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/intl/chardetect.html">here</a>.</ul>

<li>
The page has been correctly loaded with the use of a charset detector -->
the source view will load but may not correctly display characters.</li>

<b>CJK line breaking:</b> Mozilla's line breaking implements specifications
found in JIS X 4501 with some additional modifications. Read <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/3802D551.D4335C9D%40netscape.com">this

<b>CJK basic printing</b>: should be working on M13 on Windows and Mac.
Not verified to be working on Linux -- probably not.</li>

<li>
<b>Mac: Baltic display:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>ISO-8859-13</b>: You may experience a problem in Baltic ISO-8859-13
display in that some of the uppercase characters may be missing the diacritical
marks above them showing only the base characters.&nbsp; See <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9165">Bug
9165</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>One Workaround:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
1) Install a Central European script bundle (CE) from <a href="ftp://ftp.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/Czech/Macintosh/System/System_7.0.1/CZ-7.0.1-Install_1.image.sea.bin">this
Apple file</a>. (You need DiskCopy utility to mount this image). After
you mount this disk image, rather than using the Installer, open the System
file directory by double-clicking on it. In it, you will find among others,
CE (script), Slovak (keyboard layout), and slovensk (keyboard layout).
Drag these files to your current System Folder. Mac OS will then place
them in the right places.</li>

<li>
2) Next, get the fonts for Central European from <a href="ftp://ftp.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/Czech/Macintosh/System/System_7.0.1/CZ-7.0.1-Fonts.image.sea.bin">this
Apple file</a>. Once you mount this image file with DiskCopy, you will
find a number of CE fonts. Drag and drop them onto your System Folder.
Mac OS will then place them in an appropriate folder.</li>

<li>
3) After steps 1 and 2 are completed, re-start your Mac. You should now
see ISO-8859-13 (also ISO-8859-4) characters correctly.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Central European ISO-8859-2 display: </b>There seems to be a Mac bug
-- some 8-bit range characters display as "?" even though a correct font
exists on the system. See Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18095">18095</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Java: <font color="#FF0000">Java Plug-ins on Windows.</font></b> Java
plugins probably are not be working on M13. The main reason is that Mozilla
APIs sometimes get out of synch with published JRE/JDK plugins. For example,
JDK/JRE1.3 plugins don't seem to operate with M13. See Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24487">24487</a>
to keep track of Mozilla and Java Plugins for M14. The following instructions
are general setup steps for Java Plugins. When Mozilla APIs are in synch
with JDK/JRE plugins, you can use these steps to activate Java.</li>

<ul>
<li>
To get Java working on Mozilla, if the installer gives an option to install
a JRE package, the following steps will be taken care of automatically.
If you choose not to use the installer, or the package you selected does
not give you such an option (e.g. the JRE package is not currently included
in Mozilla distribution), or if you want upgrade the Java plugins yourself,
you need to take some extra steps as described below.</li>

<ul>
<li>
First get the International version of&nbsp; JRE 1.2.2 or later from <a href="http://java.sun.com/jdk/">Javasoft</a>.
We recommend using JRE1.3 (Beta at this point) for improved Java support.
JRE packages are distributed for JDK releases and Beta version downloading
requires registration first. Install the package on your Windows. We find
that JRE 1.3 Beta can run more applets than JRE 1.2.2 plugin files and
are therefore recommended. Plugin files are also much smaller in size in
the latter version.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Note to CJK Windows 95/8 users:</font></b> If
you want to use Java on these Asian Windows 95/98, you must get the <b><font color="#FF0000">international
version</font></b> of JRE which has <b>i18n.jar</b> file needed for conversion
from native charsets to Unicode -- otherwise, Mozilla will crash when trying
to start. NT4 users will have no crash of this type. If you are CJK Win95/98
users and are not using the international version of JRE and are experiencing
startup crashes, then remove the 3 <b>.dll files </b>from the <b>plugins
</b>directory
and live without Java until an international version of JRE is installed.
See discussion in Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21305">21305</a>
for details.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Create a directory named <b>plugins</b> in the same directory where the
mozilla.exe resides.</li>

<li>
Copy 3 files, <b>npjava11.dll</b>, <b>npjava12.dll</b>, and <b>npjava13.dll</b>,
from the <b>JRE's bin</b> directory into the <b>plugins</b> directory you
created in step 2.</li>

<li>
(This part should be optional since Mozilla searches for plugins automatically.)
If you have <b>Java Plug-in Control Panel</b>, you can check this from
Windows Start | Program menu. The following settings (no others) should
be checked.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Basic:</b> Java Plugin, Java Console (optional), Cache Jar in memory</li>

<li>
<b>Detailed/Advanced</b>: Use Java Plugin as default, Just in time Compiler
is on</li>

<li>
<b>Proxy</b>: use the browser setting</li>

<li>
<b>Certificates</b>: (none)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
Due to a few bugs, some applets simply will not run. Some string display
applets do run and so far we have found none can actually display non-ASCII
strings. See Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17169">17169</a>.
If you have specific applets which deal with string display, write your
finding to <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.qa.i18n">netscape.public.mozilla.qa.i18n</a>.</li>

Include these 2 people in all bugs related to Global IME.</li>

<ul>
<li>
A Global IME module is an add-on for all language versions of&nbsp; Windows
95/98/NT4. There are 4 Global IME modules (Chinese-Simplified, Chinese-Traditional,
Korean, and Japanese). They can be downloaded from a Microsoft downloading
site. Once installed, you can input in these languages (CJK) under any
non-CJK language Windows versions. These modules also enable CJK Windows
users to input in languages not supported by their operating system. For
example, Japanese Windows users can install Chinese and Korean modules,
etc. However, you <b><font color="#FF0000">should never</font></b> install
a Global IME for a language which is already covered by your OS. For example,
do not install Japanese Global IME on Japanese Windows. Windows 2000 comes
with options to install improved CJK IMEs. Therefore, users of Windows
2000 should not use these add-ons meant for other Windows.</li>

<li>
You can install either a Global IME module by itself or a Global IME with
a matching Windows font for that language. The latter is called <b>Global
IME with Language Pack</b>. We recommend getting the Global IMEs with Language
Pack. Visit <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/features/ime.asp?">this
site</a>, read the explanation, and download the modules you like. These
Global IME packages will also install usage documentation under Start |
Program | Microsoft Global IME.</li>

<b><font color="#FF0000">Copy/paste now I18n-friendly:</font> </b>Basic
intra-application copy/paste is now working in <font color="#FF0000">all
areas</font> of Mozilla for non-ASCII strings. You can copy from Browser
or Messenger viewing window and paste into all Edit fields within the application.
This should work for all languages we cover at present. (Macintosh does
not allow you to copy from Browser window and there seem to be other problems
still left in intra-application copy/paste.)
<b>Note:
</b>The inter-application
copy/paste is working partially in M13 -- the status varies from platform

from Mail compose subject header to body text area)</li>

<li>
from a viewing window (e.g. Browser) to text Edit field (e.g. form, Editor,

</ul>

<li>
<b>Known bugs:</b> Copy/cut and paste for non-ASCII string is not working
in the following <b>inter-application</b> cases. These cases are being
worked on and we should get most of this resolved in M14. See <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8427">8427</a>
for details. The following paints a general idea of where copy/paste may
not be working currently. Generally speaking, some of this is working on
Windows but not usually on Mac or Unix. Mac currently lacks support for
Unicode clipboard and this is part of the problem. Cf. Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10816">10816</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
From Mozilla to another application -- if the other application does not
support Unicode clipboard in the target Edit field. (Note: It does not
help the matter if the platform does not support Unicode clipboard, e.g.
Win95/98.) On Mac and Unix, this function seems to be generally broken.</li>

<li>
From another application to Mozilla -- if the platform does not support
Unicode clipboard. This should work on WinNT4/2000 but probably will run
into a problem Win95/98 in some cases. On Mac and Unix, this function is
probably not working at all for non-ASCII data. The general bug to deal
with this problem on all platforms is Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24010">24010</a>.</li>

<b>Form Password field input bug:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Due to a bug, the form password input is not concealed completely when
you engage CJK IMEs -- you can bring up the conversion candidate window
and see what characters you are typing. To avoid this bug, turn off the
IME and then input a password. Only this mode will work OK for the password
field. The Half-width Alphanumeric mode (e.g. Japanese IME) normally works
like the direct input mode but for this bug, it is not effective and reveals
the input when the candidate window is brought up. Only ASCII input mode
should be available in this field. See Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16940">16940</a>

<b><font size=+1>Localizability:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>General:</b> One of the key features of Mozilla is that it is relatively
easy to localize menus and dialogs UI into any language. See the framework
section below for a brief discussion of guidelines. Commercial browsers
don't often get localized into languages with smaller number of speakers.
If you want to see a fast, next generation browser in your own language,
Mozilla offers <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">a
great chance</a> to make it a reality.</li>

<li>
<b>Voluntary localization projects: </b>Currently 17 voluntary language
projects are going and more are likely to join. If you're interested in
localizing Mozilla into your favorite language, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">this
page</a> explains it all. Current projects are: <b>Bosnia, Brazilian, Catalan,
Czech, Danish, French, Georgian, German, Greek, Hawaiian, Indonesian, Japanese,
Norwegian (nynorsk), Polish, Spanish (es-CO), Spanish (es-ES), </b>and<b>
Thai</b>. <font color="#FF0000">Some of them already have published M13
kits</font>. Check out the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">Mozilla
L10n How-to Page</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Localization framework:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>We have published a guideline for localization.</b> Anyone interested
in localizing Mozilla into another language should read <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">this
document</a> carefully.</li>

<li>
Here are some basic ideas to keep in mind when localizing Mozilla. For
translating the entire Mozilla, you should read <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">this
document</a> and do it in an organized way using leveraging tools to synch
up from earlier versions. You might follow the following steps when doing
a quick translation work of a few phrases.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Do not localize <b>.xul</b> files directly. All localizations must take
place in corresponding&nbsp; <b>.dtd</b> files or <b>.property</b> files.</li>

<li>
Localizable strings have now been extracted from <b>.xul</b> into
<b>.dtd</b>
and <b>.property</b> files. The<b> </b>these files are found under&nbsp;<b>
../chrome/component_name/locale/en-US</b> directory. They match the names
of the corresponding <b>.xul</b> files which are placed under:../chrome/component_name/content/defaultdirectory.</li>

<li>
Translators need not worry about this, but if you create a <b>.xul</b>
file then you need to extract localizable string into a corresponding <b>.dtd
</b>or<b>
.property </b>file. (If you're creating Mozilla UI via a script rather
than by a static <b>.xul</b> file, then you need to extract them into a
property file.) To extract .XUL entities into DTD files for localization,
read <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-styleguide.html">this
document</a>.</li>

<li>
Mozilla assumes the default charset of all <b>.dtd</b> files to be in <b>UTF-8</b>,
and all <b>.property </b>files to be in <b>escaped Unicode</b>. If you
change UI strings to your language using non-ASCII data, they should show
OK as long as they use the appropriate Unicode encoding format. (You can
change menus to Japanese, for example, in <b>..chrome/navigator/locale/en-US/navigator.dtd
</b>file
using the method suggested above and then convert the DTD file to UTF-8.)</li>

<li>
All non-ASCII <b>.dtd</b> files must be in <b>UTF-8</b> encoding and <b>.property</b>
files in <b>escaped Unicode</b> -- these are Mozilla's default encodings
for the resource files. You do not need to explicitly mark the resource
files with these encodings, Mozilla will assume that they are in <b>UTF-8</b>
or <b>escaped Unicode</b> even if there are no charset tags.</li>

<li>
<b>Using a localized version under an operating system for another language:</b>
Some parts of&nbsp; Mozilla are dependent on the operating system widgets
for display. This means that there will be some areas (e.g. some part of
dialogs, window title, etc.) which will not display correctly if you use,
for example, a Japanized version under English Windows.</li>

<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">In summary:</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
It is best to use localization tools and methodologies mentioned on <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">this
page</a>. If you want to do a quick and dirty translation on a few strings
for a demo, you should keep the above steps in mind.</li>

Use convenient converter utilities such as "<a href="http://rosette.basistech.com/demo.html">uniconv</a>"
(for Windows and Unix) or "native2ascii" utility included in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/">latest

<b>Mozilla's nsconv conversion utility </b>has been enhanced by "jonas.utterstrom@vittran.norrnod.se"--
it now supports charset aliases<b>: </b>The original nsconv is by the courtesy
of <a href="mailto:ftang@netscape.com">Frank Tang</a>. <b>nsconv</b> is
installed in the same directory as your mozilla executable. You can use
any encoding names recognizable by Mozilla and their aliases checked into
the source in using this utility. Here's the basic command line for using
this utility:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Usage schema --any one of the following:</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#000000">nsconv -f source_charsetname -t target_charsetname
source_filename new_filename</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">nsconv -f source_charsetname -t target_charsetname
source_filename > new_filename</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">nsconv -f source_charsetname -t target_charsetname
&lt; source_filename > new_filename</font></b></li>
</ul>

<li>
You can use the charset names you see within the parentheses of&nbsp; the
Character Set menu for <b><font color="#000000">source_charsetname </font></b><font color="#000000">and
<b>target_charsetname</b>,
e.g. iso-8859-1, Shift_JIS, Big5, EUC-KR, etc. Use <b>UTF-8</b> and <b>x-u-escaped
</b>for
target encodings.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">The utility does not seem to replace an existing
file with the new output file. If you have an existing file with the same
name as the intended output, first delete the existing file. Or else output
into a new file with a different name.</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>DTD/XML encoding definition</b> supported -- thus you can use charsets
other than UTF-8 as the <b>.dtd</b> file charset, but using charset other
than UTF-8 is not recommended for Mozilla localization. We assume UTF-8
as default. Cf. <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4431">Bug
4431</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Notable bugs:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>chrome.rdf file:</b> Definitions in <b>chrome.rdf</b> files under locale
directories can be used to switch to different chromes suitable for a particular
language version, or make other chrome switches. Due to a bug (Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21647">21647</a>),
this feature is not working well.</li>

<li>
Access key and Command key shortcuts are supposed to be appended before
an ellipsis character "..." in languages like Japanese but currently Access

<b><font size=+1>Mail/News (Testing done on Windows and Linux only):</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Performance: </b>There have been 2 great improvements in M13 and Messenger
is now very much usable. We recommend that users give it a try.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Messenger should now be able to handle mailboxes with several thousand
messages. For moderate users of mail, Mozilla should be a usable daily
mail client. M13 would be a very good chance to get your Mozilla mail experience
going and participate in making it better.&nbsp; (Note: In addition to
performance improvement with server interactions, improvements in preference
settings with Mail <b>Account Setup </b>were also made in M12.)</li>

<li>
Message display code has been re-written in M13 to speed up the display
of messages measurably. Users of M12 will notice this display speed gain
immediately.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="mailprefs"></a><b>Preferences file: prefs.js </b>(Note: Up to
M8, the Preferences file was named <b>prefs50.js</b>. This file name is
<b>prefs.js</b>
instead for all later Milestones.)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#000000">General info for M13:</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Once you create a profile via the <b>Profile Manager</b>, the rest is very
easy to set up with the use of&nbsp; <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu
in the Messenger window. Read <a href="#genprefs">this section</a> also
for general preferences issues in addition to looking at Mail specific
preferences.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Mail Account Setup manager: </b>If you want to learn more about how
to setup various mail and news servers, and multiple mail mail accounts,
read <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/arch/accountmanager.html">this
document</a>. The future Mail Account Setup specs also have been published
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/specs/accounts/index.html">here</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>SMTP sever setting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
If you have not done so already, after you start up Messenger, choose <b>Edit
| Account Setup ...</b> and set the outgoing (SMTP) server and user name.
This needs to be done only once but without setting, you will not be able
to send out mail.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">Password:</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
When accessing a mail server for downloading messages, you will be asked
to provide a password via a dialog. If you want Mozilla to remember your
password, use <b>Edit | Account Setup ... </b>menu and select "server"
under each one of your accounts. Then check "Save password: box.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>IMAP server setting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu to set up a variety of IMAP server
related options.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>NNTP (News) server setting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu and add an News server. Then when
it is added, use <b>File | Subscribe ...</b> menu to add newsgroup you
want to read. Currently there is no way to list all the newsgroups on a
server. Just add newsgroups you want manually via the <b>Subscribe...</b>
menu.</li>

<li>
Reading in different languages is now working if the charset parameter
is specified in news article headers. You can also use <a href="#chardet">auto-detection
modules</a> enabled though the Browser menu to detect and display articles
without a charset parameter. At this point, news reading in Chinese will
be generally difficult since many Chinese newsgroups contain messages without
any charset parameter.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>POP Mail settings:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu and set up several different options
using the server setting under each account.</li>

<li>
You can set it up to keep the messages on the POP server after you have
downloaded them, too.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>HTML vs Plain Text Mail option:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
You can set up HTML or Plain Text send option for <b>each server</b> in
your account. In case a server is not selected in the Messenger's left
pane, the setting for <b>the very first server (on top)</b> on the Account
Manager list will be used as the default. In future, the default Mail Send
option should become possible through an UI element.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Account Names in non-ASCII characters:</b> For the names you want to
give to each of the Mail or News account, you can now use non-ASCII characters.
They will be preserved in <b>prefs.js</b> file. Remember, however, that
when there is non-ASCII data, prefs.js will be in UTF-8 encoding. If you
look in prefs.js with an editor, you will not be able to see the characters
correctly unless your editor can display UTF-8 data. If you make changes
and save the prefs.js file, your editor must be able to save in UTF-8.
Otherwise, the prefs.js will become corrupt and unusable. If you're editing
the prefs.js file and if it contains non-ASCII data, first create a backup
file and edit this one rather than the prefs.js file itself.</li>

<li>
<b>Directory Path names in non-ASCII characters?: </b>You can customize
where you store your mail msgs and summary files. At this point, non-ASCII
names must be avoided in path names.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Downloading POP msgs &amp; IMAP headers :</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The performance in these areas has improved further in M13.</li>

<li>
<b>Note:</b> some POP servers don' t handle multiple, simultaneous accesses
to the same account well. In such cases, keep only one connection alive
to use it trouble-free.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Displaying Mail links with Browser: </b>If clicking on an URL link in
a message leads to display in the Messenger window rather than in the Browser
window, choose Browser's <b>Debug | URI Dispatching | Enable Dispatching.
</b>When
you do this, URL links in mail messages will not be shown in the Messenger
window but by the Browser window. In the near future, this will be the
default behavior and links will not be shown inline in the Messenger window.</li>

<li>
<b>How various mail-related international functions are working at M13:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Address Book: </b>supports Non-ASCII (including CJK) input, editing
and display. The following features are working.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Non-ASCII Input into card fields</b></li>

<li>
<b>List View pane --</b> proper international sorting (Windows and Macintosh
only.)</li>

<li>
<b>Each card view pane -- </b>displays non-ASCII strings</li>

<li>
<b>Can re-edit existing cards </b>with non-ASCII entries.</li>

<li>
<b>New Msg button on Address Book entries:</b> works and will import any
language name into the "To: " header for new mail correctly.</li>

<li>
<b>Address Picker on Mail Composer window: </b>works for all languages
we support and displays all non-ASCII names correctly.</li>

<li>
<b>Address auto-completion</b> is working partially. If an Address Book
entry contains non-ASCII characters, they are now displayed correctly.
However, trying to match with with non-ASCII characters don't work with
M13.</li>

<li>
<b>Importing 4.5 or later AB entries: </b>Address book entries import from
Communicator 4.5 or later is now possible. Just export your Address Book
entries using Communicator 4.5 or later. This will create a file with <b>.ldif
</b>extension.
Import this file using <b>File | Import&nbsp;</b> menu from the Address
Book. (Note: This will not work with <b>.ldif </b>files created by Communicator
4.0x versions since they are not saved in UTF-8 and instead saved in the
default charset of the operating system.)</li>

<li>
<b>Bugs:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
On Unix, sorting in Address Book is not working well.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Multi-lingual mail viewing: </b><font color="#FF0000">This is working
on all platforms.</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
Multilingual viewing is working on IMAP, POP3 and NNTP servers as long
as the messages contain properly MIME-encoded headers and body with correct
charset parameters.</li>

<li>
View | Character Set menu is currently not working to override wrong MIME
charset label, or view msgs which have no MIME charset (except for Latin
1) specified.</li>

<li>
If you have a multilingual font or several fonts which together cover the
Unicode ranges (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Korean fonts + Pan-European fonts),
we use them in displaying mail messages and headers for all the languages
we support. We pay attention to the charset parameter in the Content-Type
header and switch to an appropriate font. The Character Set menu is not
needed to switch to different language views unless the message you're
viewing is incorrectly labeled. If you would like a basic mono-weight multi-lingual
font for Windows, you can get Bitstream Cyberbit font 2.0 <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/extras/fonts/windows/">here</a>.
Mail font settings are also affected by prefs.js setting as <a href="#fontprefs">described
above</a> in the Browser section --</li>

<li>
Earlier there were a few bugs which prevented Mozilla from displaying Thai
(Windows-874 or TIS-620) mail messages. They have been fixed and now you
can view mail messages sent in these encodings.</li>

<li>
<b>Viewing News: </b>is working. Multilingual news articles viewing works
if they have correct MIME charsets indicated in the articles. Be warned,
however, that newsgroups postings are not always MIME-compliant and this
could defeat our charset honoring mechanism.</li>

<li>
<b>Bugs:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Sender names do not display correctly in the thread pane except for Latin
1 names. (CJK names display as dots.) They are displayed correctly in the
Message view window, however. Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8405">8405</a>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Viewing non-ASCII attachments: </b>generally working but there are some
bugs.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Attachments should be viewable if they are of the same charset as the main
body of the mail or if it has explicit charset parameter in the attachment
headers, or if it contains a valid Meta-charset headers in the attached
HTML file.&nbsp; If an attachment lacks charset parameter info and if its
charset does not match that of the main body, that attachment cannot be
viewed currently even when the Character menu is changed to match the charset
of the attachment. A charset detector as discussed above can work on attachments
without explicit charset information -- if it is turned on via the Browser
menu.</li>

<li>
<b>Multiple attachments in different languages:</b> can now be viewed without
changing the charset menu if each attachment's header contains a correct
charset parameter or if a document contains a valid Meta-charset information.
If you send a message from Mozilla with multiple attachments and if each
attachment has a meta charset tag, Mozilla will create a content-type charset
parameter for each attachment from the meta-tag information.</li>

<li>
<b>Latin 1 attachment to ASCII msg:</b> In M12, if an attachment contained
raw 8-bit Latin 1 characters and was attached to a mail body with an us-ascii
charset parameter, Mozilla did not display these attachments correctly.
We fixed this problem in M13 by assuming ISO-8859-1 instead of ASCII as
the message charset in such a case. See Bugs <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20997">20997</a>
&amp; <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22209">22209</a>
for details.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="mailchardet"></a><b>Japanese attachments and auto-detection:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The auto-detection module set for the Browser via its Auto-Detect&nbsp;
menu will also detect the charset of mail attachments. See <a href="#chardet">above</a>
on how to set an charset detection module.</li>

<li>
Currently there is a bug which corrupts Japanese EUC-JP attachment display.
To work around this problem, we have put in a mail specific charset detector
which only works in Messenger under Windows only. (Note: Eventually this
detector will be removed when the EUC bug is fixed.) When this is set,
this detector rather than the Browser detector will be used in Messenger.&nbsp;
This detector will be ON even when the Browser detector is OFF. For those
wishing to view Japanese EUC files attached to mail messages, we recommend
that this workaround be put in place. There is no UI for this but this
is how you can use it:</li>

<ul>
<li>
In the <b>prefs.js file, </b>insert the following line:</li>

<ul>
<li>
user_pref("mail.charset.detector", "jaclassic");&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- this
is basically a detector module used for Communicator 4.x.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Printing: </b>Basic printing is enabled. Currently it is rather primitive.
Headers don't seem to be printed -- only body text.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu and thread pane reloading:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The menu change causes the thread pane to reload properly. This makes it
possible to display non-MIME-encoded headers which don't match the current
Character Set menu setting.&nbsp; Headers, body, and attachments without
MIME charset information may not be displayed properly, however, even if
the Character Set menu is changed.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>IMAP and Local non-ASCII folder names:</b> Latin 1 names display OK.
Multi-byte folder names (e.g. CJK) don't display well yet. Cf. Bugs <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7130">7130</a>
(IMAP), <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7844">7844</a>
(Local).</li>

<li>
<b>International Sorting for Thread pane headers: </b>works well in the
<b>Subject
</b>headers
on all platforms with some problems still left on certain Unix locales.
CJK characters are not displayed correctly in the
<b>Sender </b>field and
therefore cannot be tested. Sorting should be done according to the sort
default for the language of your operating system. Date/Time sorting is
also working as it should.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Linux sorting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
There seems to be a problem with Latin 1 sort -- this is under investigation.</li>

<li>
Also sorting is working for some Japanese locale names but not others.
It might have to do with locale name aliasing. This problem is under investigation.
Cf. Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18338">18338</a>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>International Date/Time format:&nbsp;</b> now works for NT4, Win9x,
and Mac for all locales. The format will be used according to your OS's
date/time format setting.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">Sending Latin 1 &amp; Japanese attachments/pages:</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>File | Send Page</b> works in addition to attaching a local file to
a message.</li>

<li>
Note that Mozilla will append a charset parameter to the attachment headers
if the page contains an HTTP-Equiv meta charset tag.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Send-related bugs at M13: </b>Here are some send-related bugs at M13.</li>

<ul>
<li>
If the message you're trying to reply to or forward as inline has an attachment
displayed inline, none of&nbsp; the attachment is quoted. Forward as attachment
does work, however. Cf. Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23931">23931</a>.</li>

<li>
Sending page with a meta charset tag will mark the attachment with an appropriate
charset parameter but sending a page with HTTP charset does not add this
charset info. This problem has been fixed in M14. See Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24940">24940</a>.</li>

<li>
At M13, reply/forward does not initially set the charset to the same one
as the original mail. This has been fixed in M14 to reflect the original
mail's main body charset. See Bug <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3979">3979</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Sending messages in other languages: View | Character Set menu </b>for
New Mail Compose window is working for sending mail for many additional

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">Composing Latin 1 mail messages:</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
In sending 8-bit range characters with HTML mail under Latin encodings,
starting with M11, we used 8-bit characters rather than HTML entities,
and certain special characters not in the chosen encoding were turned into
CERs (so-called HTML entities) or NCRs (numeric character references).
We changed this back at M13 to using HTML entities for all non-ASCII range
of the Latin 1 table.</li>

<li>
In sending 8-bit range characters with Plain Text mail, we will generally
use QP-encoded characters. Those characters not in the chosen encoding,
e.g. the EURO under ISO-8859-1 is turned into a "?" symbol. We are considering
more user-friendly spec for this currently.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>General Fallback strategy for sending characters not found in the chosen

<b>Notes on Composing Latin 1 and Japanese Mail messages:</b>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Composing Latin 1 Mail:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Copying/pasting accented characters into the headers and&nbsp; body works
from anywhere within the application where <b>copy</b> is enabled, e.g.
Messenger Mail window, Browser window. You can also copy non-ASCII data
from Communicator 4.x into Mozilla.</li>

<li>
Keyboard input into headers (e.g. subject) also works for accented characters.
Using the English keyboard for Latin 1 high-bit input, ALTGr + 0+Number
Keypad method works, e.g. Right ALT key + 0232. There is an annoying bug
about ALT+NumPad use -- see the Editor section for more.</li>

<li>
Make sure to switch the <b>View | Character Set</b>&nbsp; to your chosen
Character set name before you send out a message.</li>

<li>
Basic MIME compliance is there: Header Q encoding, and Body QP encoding
for accented characters.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Composing Japanese mail:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Basic Japanese input works for body.&nbsp; Japanese input/copying into
the headers and body also work from within Mozilla. You can also copy JPN
data from Communicator 4.x into Mozilla.</li>

<li>
Mail goes out in ISO-2022-JP.&nbsp; Header is B-encoded. (The Kanji-in
escape sequence is that of JISX0208-1990/83. )</li>

<li>
Make sure to switch the <b>View | Character Set&nbsp;</b> to Japanese (ISO-2022-JP)
before you send out a message.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Sending other charset mail</b> --<font color="#FF0000"> is enabled.</font>
Please try out these new charsets! For example,<b> Central European, Cyrillic,
Greek, UTF-8, Thai, etc.</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Though the mail text body can sense what keyboard you have selected and
will switch font accordingly, there may be mapping bugs with some international
keyboards.&nbsp; If you find a bug with your charset/language, please file
it <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">here</a>.</li>
