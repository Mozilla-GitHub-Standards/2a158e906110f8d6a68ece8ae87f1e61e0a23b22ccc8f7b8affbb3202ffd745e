<h3>
International Bugorama</h3>
Thanx for attending the International Bugorama. Our primary objective is
to discover bugs, problems, or design flaws that might hinder International
users from using Mozilla. For this reason, you should pick a language besides
English for all your testing. If possible, use a machine with an non-English
operating system. If you don't understand a language other than English,
you can still play the game. Just use the translate feature from the view
menu.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<b>Special International Features</b></h3>
If you haven't had any international user experience, you will get to play
with a couple of cool features that may be new to you:
<ol>
<li>
View | Character Coding submenu. This submenu lets you change character
coding on any page at any time. Although many web pages indicate their
character coding in HTML, many others do not. If you come accross a page
that looks like garbage, try changing the character coding.</li>

<li>
View | Translate dialog. This feature presents you with a list of languages
you can translate into or from. Highly recommended as light entertainment,
as well as an invaluable aid for getting the "gist" of a document.</li>

<li>
Edit | preferences | fonts. This preferences panel lists the fonts on your
system and (hypothetically) permits you to change fonts. Don't be surprised
if it isn't ready to go yet.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Machine locations</h3>
If you already have a machine running an international operating system,
please use that.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Your Mission (should you decide to accept it)</h3>
Congratulations! You have just been hired by agents of the Evil Empire
to find the secret (or obvious) failings of Mozilla browser. Your spy managers
will be known to you only as amasri@netscape.com and roberts@netscape.com.
As always, should any of your activities be discovered by enemy agents,
the secretariat will disavow all knowledge. Also, if you buy anything online,
you will have to pay for your own purchases! Your mission is to go undercover
in the country of your choice, using the language of that country, and
assume one of the following cover identities. Notice that these scenarios
are open-ended: you won't be able to do everything. Just use the scenarios
as a starting point for exploring seamonkey in your own, unique way.
<h3>
CEO of a startup company</h3>
As CEO, you have several pressing needs that can be met over the internet.
As CEO, you know best what these are, but the secretariat would suggest:
<ol>
<li>
Figure out just exactly what your company does. If you can't figure out
anything better, you may assume that your company sells Martian Real Estate,
so the only expenses you will have are paper (for printing the deeds) and
attorneys (to defend yourself against fraud claims)</li>

<li>
Research companies with similar products or services. If you are selling
Martian Real Estate, you might investigate software companies that specialize
in vaporware.</li>

<li>
Find employees to fill key positions</li>

<li>
Find government functionaries who may be helpful to you</li>

<li>
Rent office space and buy equipment.</li>

<li>
Buy secret spy stuff</li>

<li>
Put together an AIM buddy list with all your top executives</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Winner of "Do you want to be a millionaire"</h3>
As winner or $1,000,000, you need to find stuff to buy with your all money.
You may want to find some good investments (if you haven't spent all your
money yet). You could look for retirement homes or tax havens. Be sure
to use wallet--it makes spending money so much easier. If you don't want
to pay the IRS, you could also look for a good tax attorney. Be sure to
use the wallet for filling out forms, and remember, the secretariat will
not be signing any expense vouchers!
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Reporting Results</h3>
Once you have finished your mission, report your findings, on paper or
email, to amasri@netscape.com or momoi@netscape.com.
