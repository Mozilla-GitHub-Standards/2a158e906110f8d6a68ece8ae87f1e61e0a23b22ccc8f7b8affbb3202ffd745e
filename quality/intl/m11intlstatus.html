<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br><a NAME="genprefs"></a><b>Preferences</b></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FF0000">There is now very little need to directly edit Preferences
file, </font><b><font color="#000000">prefs.js.</font></b><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;</font>
Both profile migration and new profile creation are now very easy to accomplish
with the improved Profile Manager. Users who have had trouble setting up
Mail server(s) before should try Profile Manager.</li>

<li>
Mozilla can migrate any Communicator 4.x profiles you have on your system.
Choose an existing one from 4.x and a new one will be created for Mozilla.</li>

<ul>
<li>
The window for profile migration will appear the first time you start M11
build after the installation.</li>

<li>
If it does not, you can start with the profile manager: <b>mozilla -installer
(Unix &amp; Win).&nbsp; </b>Mac users can start with the <b>Mozilla Profile
Manager</b> file.</li>

<li>
<font color="#FF0000">Important Note: </font><font color="#000000">If you
run Profile Manager and exit without selecting any profile, you may have
a problem starting Mozilla thereafter. This seems to be a bug. In such
case, run the Profile Manager again and select a profile. After this, you
will not have the problem.</font></li>
</ul>

<li>
If you have used an earlier version of Mozilla, we recommend that you delete
the file called <b>mozregistry.dat (Win)/Mozilla registry (Mac)/registry
(Unix) </b>before you run M11 Mozilla. (Don't delete <b>Netscape Registry</b>
file for Mac, which is for Communicator 4.x.). We recommend this procedure
because during an earlier Milestone, i.e. M10, there has been a change
in the way registry works and the old registry prior to M9 will not work
well with builds later than M9. Read the section in the Release Notes called
<b>Files
Used or Created</b> to find out where you can find these files.</li>

<li>
When you start M11 after having deleted <b>mozregistry.dat or registry,
</b>you
will be asked to create a new profile. If you name an existing profile,
that profile will be used. Otherwise "Default" profile called "mozProfile"
will be created. If this latter happens, you can replace the <b>prefs.js</b>
file in the Default folder with the one from an existing profile directory.
(Note that
<b>the default profile name</b> changed from <b>prefs50.js</b>
(of M8 and earlier) to <b>prefs.js </b>starting with M9.)</li>

<li>
Also read the Installation instructions for your platform carefully in
this Release Notes.</li>
</ul>
<b><font size=+1>Browser:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
There have been a number of&nbsp; improvements made since M10 in stability
and features that matter to international users. M11 is now closer to a
browser usable on a daily basis.</li>

<li>
<b>GFX widget/Ender </b>is <b>ON</b> by default and thus requires no special
setting in the <b>prefs.js</b> as was reported for M9. This means that
all input areas in M11 support non-ASCII character input including input
using CJK IMEs. Editor bugs reported for M10 have been mostly fixed in
M11. Thus users should have usable Editor on all platforms.&nbsp; Read
the Editor section below for more information.</li>

<li>
<b>M11 converter(s)</b>: There are no new converters in M11.&nbsp; See
here for <a href="#charlist">a list of all the converters at M11</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Unix charset testing:&nbsp; </b>As mentioned in the M7 Release Notes,
the display for the supported charsets except Armenian, Thai, and Vietnamese
should be working now.&nbsp; We would like users to continue to look at
various Unix charsets and <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">file a
bug </a>if a problem is found. The list of the supported charsets at M11
can be found
<a href="#charlist">below</a>.
<font color="#FF0000">Please
download the Unix binary and check out our support for these character
sets.
</font>(Note: You need appropriate fonts to display these languages
-- pcf.gz format on Linux. Visit <a href="http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859.html">this
site</a> for ISO and Cyrillic BDF fonts, and <a href="ftp://ftp.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/fonts/">this
site</a> for multi-byte language fonts. For converting from BDF to PCF
format fonts, use <b>bdftopcf</b> utility.)</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Note: </b>The current Character Set menus (including the name of the
menu itself) are temporary and will be replaced eventually an entirely
new single menu. The new menu specs will be published soon. The name "Character
Set" will also be replaced by a new name.</li>

<li>
<b>You will notice that there are 7 Character Set Menus </b>in the Browser
window, and 6 in Composer/Editor and Messenger.</li>

<li>
The first 6 "static" menus with sub-titles such as "ISO" constitute a workaround
for long, non-customizable and non-scrollable menu.</li>

<li>
The 7th Character Set menu -- found only in the Browser window -- is the
dynamic menu which is under development but will eventually replace the
workaround menu. This is the same menu as the first 6 put together. It
does not scroll under Linux and Windows and so you cannot probably see
the whole list except on Mac, but the dynamic menu is created via a script.
This is first of the series of steps we will be taking to make the Character
Set menu completely dynamic and eventually accommodate new Character sets
via a plug-in directory. The dynamic Character set menu will use the Extensibility
Model as discussed in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/extensibility-model.html">this
document</a>.</li>

<li>
Both types of&nbsp; menus work in M11 and one of them is actually redundant.
This is harmless, however. Character set menus in other components are
still static at this point and you will not see the dynamic menu.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="charworkaround"></a><b><font color="#000000">View | Character
Set menu Display problem workaround:</font><font color="#FF0000"> </font></b>The
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/intl/charmenufix.html">workaround
mentioned in M10</a> and earlier Release Notes has been incorporated into
M11 and thus is no longer necessary.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu usage:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
You can switch to different Character set upon encountering a page which
does not have a&nbsp; meta charset tag and which is not displaying correctly.
If you happen to have a charset detector ON and if the display is failing,
you need to first turn OFF the detector setting, and then try the Character
Set menu. Otherwise, the charset detector's choice will always predominate
over the manual menu selection. You will not see a checkmark next to the
menu item yet, however.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<a NAME="chardet"></a><b>Charset detection modules </b>in the <b>Browser
Menu.</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The charset detection modules for <b>Chinese</b>, <b>Japanese</b>,
<b>Korean</b>,
<b>East
Asian (CJK)</b>, <b>Chinese (Simplified &amp; Traditional Chinese)</b>,
<b>Ukrainian</b>,
and <b>Russian</b> are in a menu below the Character Set menu. (<font color="#FF0000">Note:
</font><font color="#000000">At
present, there are a few bugs for </font><font color="#FF0000">Ukrainian</font><font color="#000000">
and </font><font color="#FF0000">Russian</font><font color="#000000"> modules
from working. There is also a bad bug which prevents any character input
by Editor once either of these auto-detect modules is turned on. We recommend
against this using these 2 modules until these bugs are fixed.)</font></li>

<li>
You can select 1 charset detection module at a time. Once selected, the
auto detection for the charsets of&nbsp; language(s) you selected will
be ON until you turn it OFF.</li>

<li>
The charset detector will be engaged even when you have selected a Character
Set explicitly via the Character Set menu. If you need to override the
effect of the charset detector in effect, choose OFF, and then select a
new Character Set from the Character Set menu. Please use the charset detector
feature for a variety of web pages in the languages of your choice and
let us know how we are doing. File a bug at <font color="#000000"><a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a></font>
or send your comments to <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.i18n">netscape.public.mozilla.i18n</a>
or&nbsp; <font color="#000000"><a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.qa.i18n">netscape.public.mozilla.qa.i18n</a></font>.</li>

<li>
Until M10, these charset detectors could be used only by <b>prefs.js</b>
settings. This is no longer necessary since the charset detector menu fulfills
exactly the same function.&nbsp; The menu now controls what gets inserted
into
<b>chardet_name
</b>of:</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>user_pref("intl.charset.detector", "<b>chardet_name</b>");</ul>

<ul>&nbsp;
<br>If the charset detector is OFF, then <b>chardet_name</b> value will
be empty. As reported before, unit testing also can be done via a utility
called "Detectch.exe" found in the same directory as the "mozilla.exe"
file. If you are interested in modifying the prefs.js for charset detector
modules or use the command line utility, read the usage instruction
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/intl/chardetect.html">here</a>.</ul>

<ul>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
<b>HTTP charset</b>: Mozilla supports server-generated HTTP charset correctly.
(The order of priority is: HTTP charset > Document Meta Charset > Browser
Menu choice.)</li>

<li>
<b>View | Page Source:</b> works only partially for different charsets.</li>

<ul>
<li>
It seems to work OK:</li>

<ul>
<li>
if the page has a correct HTTP charset associated with it</li>
</ul>

<li>
In other cases, there are some reported failures of correct display or
non-loading. They fall under 3 types of cases:</li>

<ul>
<li>
The page has a document-based meta charset tag --> may not load the source
view or may load the page itself again rather than the source of that page.
(The latter has been reported for Linux. Both bugs were fixed in M12.)</li>

<li>
The page has been correctly loaded with the use of a charset detector -->
the source view will load but may not correctly display characters.</li>

<li>
When none of the conditions above holds and the user has loaded the page
correctly with the manual change of the Character Set menu --> the source
view will load but may not correctly display characters.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>CJK line breaking:</b> Mozilla's line breaking implements specifications
found in JIS X 4501 with some additional modifications. Read <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/3802D551.D4335C9D%40netscape.com">this
news article</a> posted to the newsgroup <b>netscape.public.mozilla.i18n</b>
by Frank Tang for details.</li>

<li>
<b>CJK basic printing</b>: should be working on M11 on Windows. Not verified
to be working on Linux -- probably not.</li>

<li>
<b>EUC-TW bug: </b>M10 had a bug which produces wrong display for EUC-TW
(Traditional Chinese) pages. This problem has been fixed.</li>

<li>
<b>Mac: Baltic display:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>ISO-8859-13</b>: You may experience a problem in Baltic ISO-8859-13
display in that some of the uppercase characters may be missing the diacritical
marks above them showing only the base characters.&nbsp; See <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9165">Bug
9165</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>One Workaround:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
1) Install a Central European script bundle (CE) from <a href="ftp://ftp.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/Czech/Macintosh/System/System_7.0.1/CZ-7.0.1-Install_1.image.sea.bin">this
Apple file</a>. (You need DiskCopy utility to mount this image). After
you mount this disk image, rather than using the Installer, open the System
file directory by double-clicking on it. In it, you will find among others,
CE (script), Slovak (keyboard layout), and slovensk (keyboard layout).
Drag these files to your current System Folder. Mac OS will then place
them in the right places.</li>

<li>
2) Next, get the fonts for Central European from <a href="ftp://ftp.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/Czech/Macintosh/System/System_7.0.1/CZ-7.0.1-Fonts.image.sea.bin">this
Apple file</a>. Once you mount this image file with DiskCopy, you will
find a number of CE fonts. Drag and drop them onto your System Folder.
Mac OS will then place them in an appropriate folder.</li>

<li>
3) After steps 1 and 2 are completed, re-start your Mac. You should now
see ISO-8859-13 (also ISO-8859-4) characters correctly.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Central European ISO-8859-2 display: </b>There seems to be a Mac bug
-- some 8-bit range characters display as "?" even though a correct font
exists on the system.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Java: </b>Java Plug-ins work OK on Windows.</li>

<ul>
<li>
To get Java working on Mozilla, you need to take some extra steps as described
below.</li>

<ul>
<li>
First get the JRE 1.2.2 or later from <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Javasoft</a>.
(JRE package may be included in Mozilla distribution also.) Install the
package on your Windows. We find that JRE 1.3 Beta can run more applets
than JRE 1.2.2 plugin files and are therefore recommended. Plugin files
are also much smaller in size in the latter version.</li>

<li>
Create a directory named <b>plugins</b> in the same directory where the
mozilla.exe resides.</li>

<li>
Copy 3 files, <b>npjava11.dll</b>, <b>npjava12.dll</b>, and <b>npjava13.dll</b>,
from the <b>JRE's bin</b> directory into the <b>plugins</b> directory you
created in step 2.</li>

<li>
Check the <b>Java Plug-in Control Panel</b> from Windows Start | Program
menu. The following settings (no others) must be checked.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Basic:</b> Java Plugin, Java Console (optional), Cache Jar in memory</li>

<li>
<b>Detailed/Advanced</b>: Use Java Plugin as default, Just in time Compiler
is on</li>

<li>
<b>Proxy</b>: use the browser setting</li>

<li>
<b>Certificates</b>: (none)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
Due to a few bugs, some applets simply will not run. Some string display
applets do run and so far we have found none can actually display non-ASCII
strings. If you have specific applets which deal with string display, write
your finding to <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.qa.i18n">netscape.public.mozilla.qa.i18n</a>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size=+1>Editor: </font></b>For IME specifications, see <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/input-method-spec.html">this
document</a> by <a href="mailto:tague@netscape.com">Tague Griffith</a>.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Note: </b>There have been many small fixes made in M11 to make editing
easier for the user. The user will find editing tasks generally easier
with M11.</li>

<li>
<b>CJK IME:</b> All major bugs present in M10 have been fixed.</li>

<li>
<b>Basic IME support on Unix: </b>We test Japanese input under <b>Red Hat
6.0 + kinput2 + wnn4</b>. <b><font color="#FF0000">We need your help on
testing other Unix platforms and other language IMEs!</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Good news!:
</font></b><font color="#000000">Almost
all major Unix IME-related bugs observed in M10 have been fixed in M11.</font></li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Help test (Japanese) IME on Unix!: </b>We need the following kinds of
testing for Japanese IME&nbsp; and others on Unix. Please send your comments
to <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.i18n">netscape.public.mozilla.i18n</a>
or file a bug using <font color="#000000"><a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a></font>
Bug Management System for Mozilla.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Testing on other platforms -- our reference platform was Red Hat 6.0.</li>

<li>
Testing other XIM-based Japanese IMEs (both public domain and commercial
ones such as Wnn6+xwnmo) to see how we are doing. We used kinput2 + wnn4
as our testing environment. We need input from people using other IMEs
and servers. Write to us also if you can confirm other IMEs are working.
If there are special conditions to be followed, include that information
also.</li>

<li>
We would also like to hear from users of IMEs for Chinese and Korean. Write
to: <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.i18n">netscape.public.mozilla.i18n</a>
about your findings.</li>

<ul>
<li>
So far we have received reports that XCIN for Traditional Chinese works
with Mozilla. Also internally we could get one Korean IME to work. We will
publish further info in the future about these IMEs.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="imebugs"></a><b>IME bugs -- </b><font color="#FF0000">you should
know the following to use IMEs effectively.</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>On all platforms:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">The crashing bug, which was caused by the user inputting
characters via IME without any ASCII characters first, has been fixed.</font></li>
</ul>

<li>
<font color="#000000"><b>On Unix:&nbsp; </b>Although the crashing bugs
have been fixed, there are a few annoying bugs still remaining. Unix IME
is by no means in a great shape yet but it is generally usable in M11.
You need to be aware of&nbsp; the following bugs for Unix IME.</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000"><b>The over-the-spot position of the input area</b>
is not well-aligned when you first start inputting character. It is positioned
above the top edge of the current window. You will not see the characters
well until the first input has been committed. Once the initial string
has been committed, the next input process brings down the IME input area
to the visible position.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">With kinput2, we noticed a bug in which the input
module window often covers the input line. You can move the window if this
bothers you.</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Form Password field input bug:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Due to a bug, the form password input is not concealed when you engage
CJK IMEs. To avoid this bug, turn off the IME and then input a password.
Only this mode will work OK for the password field. The Half-width Alphanumeric
mode (e.g. Japanese IME) normally works like the direct input mode but
for this bug, it is not effective and reveals the password input as you
enter characters.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Copy/paste in Non-ASCII strings: </b>Basic intra-application copy/paste
is now working for non-ASCII strings. Improvements are expected in M12.

</ul>
<b><font size=+1>Localizability:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Localization framework:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
We have published a guideline for localization. Anyone interested in localizing
Mozilla into a native language should read <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-how2l10n.html">this
document</a> carefully.</li>

<li>
Here are some basic ideas to keep in mind when localizing Mozilla.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Do not localize <b>.xul</b> files directly. All localizations must take
place in corresponding&nbsp; <b>.dtd</b> files or property files.</li>

<li>
Most localizable strings have now been extracted from <b>.xul</b> into
<b>.dtd</b>
(or property files) files. The<b> .dtd</b> files are found under&nbsp;<b>
../chrome/component_name/locale/en-US</b> directory. They match the names
of the corresponding <b>.xul</b> files which are placed under:<b>../chrome/component_name/content/default
</b>directory.&nbsp;
(Note: Some samples of property files, which can also be localized, are
found under <b>../res</b> directory but there are currently only a few
examples of this type of files.)</li>

<li>
If you create a <b>.xul</b> file then you need to extract localizable string
into a corresponding&nbsp; <b>.dtd </b>file. (If you're creating Mozilla
UI via a script rather than by a static <b>.xul</b> file, then you need
to extract them into a property file.) To extract .XUL entities into DTD
files for localization, read <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/intl/xul-styleguide.html">this
document</a>.</li>

<li>
XUL/XML/RDF files assume the default charset to be in UTF-8. If you change
UI strings to your favorite language, they should show OK as long as the
localized files use UTF-8 charset. (You can change menus to Japanese, for
example, in <b>..chrome/navigator/locale/en-US/navigator.dtd </b>file using
the method suggested above and then convert the DTD file to UTF-8.) The
menu items generally cannot be in languages your system does not support,
e.g.&nbsp; no Japanese menu for US Windows is possible at the moment.</li>

<li>
All non-ASCII <b>.dtd</b> and <b>.property</b> files must be in UTF-8 encoding,
which is Mozilla's default encoding for resource files. You do not need
to explicitly mark the resource files with this encoding, Mozilla will
assume that they are in UTF-8 if there are no charset tags.</li>

<li>
<b>UTF-8 conversion utility:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use convenient converter utilities such as "<a href="http://rosette.basistech.com/demo.html">uniconv</a>"
(for Windows and Unix) or "native2ascii" utility included in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/">latest
JDK</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>Mozilla's nsconv conversion utility </b>has been enhanced by "jonas.utterstrom@vittran.norrnod.se"--
it now supports charset aliases<b>: </b>The original nsconv is by the courtesy
of <a href="mailto:ftang@netscape.com">Frank Tang</a>. <b>nsconv</b> is
installed in the same directory as your mozilla executable. You can use
any encoding names recognizable by Mozilla and their aliases checked into
the source in using this utility. Here's the basic command line for using
this utility:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">Usage schema --any one of the following:</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#000000">nsconv -f source_charsetname -t target_charsetname
source_filename new_filename</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">nsconv -f source_charsetname -t target_charsetname
source_filename > new_filename</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">nsconv -f source_charsetname -t target_charsetname
&lt; source_filename > new_filename</font></b></li>
</ul>

<li>
You can use the charset names you see within the parentheses of&nbsp; the
Character Set menu for <font color="#000000"><b>source_charsetname </b>and
<b>target_charsetname</b>,
e.g. iso-8859-1, Shift_JIS, Big5, EUC-KR, etc.</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>DTD/XML encoding definition</b> supported -- thus&nbsp; you can use
charsets other than UTF-8 as the resource file charset, but using charset
other than UTF-8 is not recommended for Mozilla localization. We assume
UTF-8 as default. Cf. <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4431">Bug
4431</a>.</li>

<a NAME="mailprefs"></a><b>Preferences file: prefs.js </b><font color="#FF0000">(Note:
Up to M8, the Preferences file was named <b>prefs50.js</b>. This file name

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#000000">Preferences changes for M11:</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The greatest beneficiary of the M11 fixes in Preferences and Profile Manager
is the Mail user. IMAP and POP mail and News servers settings can be done
via UI now and messages/articles download rather easily. Read <a href="#genprefs">this
section</a> also in addition to looking at Mail specific preferences.</li>

<li>
If you have been hesitating to use Mozilla Mail and News, M11 offers very
good reason to start using them. It's very easy to set up. Just use <b>Edit
| Account Setup ...</b> menu!</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>SMTP sever setting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
If you have not done so already, after you start up Messenger, choose <b>Edit
| Account Setup ...</b> and set the outgoing (SMTP) server and user name.
This needs to be done only once but without setting, you will not be able
to send out mail. If you want to learn more about how SMTP setup and multiple
mail mail accounts, read <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/arch/accountmanager.html">this
document</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Password:</font> </b>Starting with M9, Mozilla
ignores the password provided in the <b>prefs.js</b> file.</li>

<ul>
<li>
When accessing a mail server for downloading messages, you will be asked
to provide a password via a dialog. If you want Mozilla to remember your
password, use <b>Edit | Account Setup ... </b>menu and select "server"
under each one of your accounts. Then check "Save password: box. You can
also insert the following line into the <b>prefs.js</b> file:</li>
</ul>

<ul>user_pref("mail.server.server1.remember_password", true);
<p>where "1" in "server1" should be changed to match your server number.</ul>

<li>
<b>IMAP server setting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu to set up a variety of IMAP server
related options.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>NNTP (News) server setting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
In M11, this is very easy to do. Use <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu
and add an News server. Then when it is added, use File | Subscribe ...
menu to add newsgroup you want to read.</li>

<li>
Reading in different languages is now working if the charset parameter
is specified in news articles. At this point, news reading in Chinese will
be generally difficult since many Chinese newsgroups contain messages without
any charset parameter.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>POP Mail settings:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Use <b>Edit | Account Setup ...</b> menu and set up several different options
using the server setting under each account.</li>

<li>
You can set it up to keep the messages on the POP server after you have
downloaded them, too.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Downloading POP mail:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The performance in this process improved greatly in M11 as compared to
M10.</li>

<li>
Note: some POP servers don' t handle multiple, simultaneous accesses to
the same account well. In such cases, keep only one connection alive to
use it trouble-free.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>How various mail-related international functions are working at M11:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Address Book: </b>now supports Non-ASCII (including CJK) input, editing
and display. The following features are working.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Non-ASCII Input into card fields</b></li>

<li>
<b>List View pane --</b> proper international sorting</li>

<li>
<b>Each card view pane -- </b>displays non-ASCII strings</li>

<li>
<b>Can re-edit existing cards </b>with non-ASCII entries.</li>

<li>
<b>New message button </b>-- quotes non-ASCII names correctly</li>

<li>
<b>Composer Address Picker</b> -- now select non-ASCII names correctly.</li>

<li>
<b>Address auto-completion</b> is working partially. If an Address Book
entry contains non-ASCII characters, they are now displayed correctly.
However, matching try with non-ASCII characters don't work with M11.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Multi-lingual mail viewing: </b><font color="#FF0000">This is working
on all platforms.</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
Multilingual viewing is working on IMAP, POP3 and NNTP servers as long
as the messages contain properly MIME-encoded headers and body with correct
charset parameters.</li>

<li>
View | Character Set menu is currently not working to override wrong MIME
charset label, or view msgs which have no MIME charset (except for Latin
1) specified.</li>

<li>
If you have a multilingual font or several fonts which together cover the
Unicode ranges (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Korean fonts + Pan-European fonts),
we use them in displaying mail messages and headers for all the languages
we support. We pay attention to the charset parameter in the Content-Type
header and switch to an appropriate font. The Character Set menu is not
needed to switch to different language views unless the message you're
viewing is incorrectly labeled. If you would like a basic mono-weight multi-lingual
font, you can get Bitstream Cyberbit font 2.0 <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/extras/fonts/windows/">here</a>.</li>

<li>
Earlier there were a few bugs which prevented Mozilla from displaying Thai
(Windows-874 or TIS-620) mail messages. They have been fixed and now you
can view mail messages sent in these encodings.</li>

<li>
<b>Viewing News: </b>is working. Multilingual news articles viewing works
if they have correct MIME charsets indicated in the articles. Be warned,
however, that newsgroups postings are not always MIME-compliant and this
could defeat our charset honoring mechanism.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Viewing non-ASCII attachments: </b>generally working but there are some
bugs.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Attachments should be viewable if they are of the same charset as the main
body of the mail or if it has explicit charset parameter in the attachment
headers.&nbsp; If an attachment lacks charset parameter info and if its
charset does not match that of the main body, that attachment cannot be
viewed currently even when the Character menu is changed to match the charset
of the attachment. A charset detector as discussed above can work on attachments
without explicit charset information -- if it is turned on.</li>

<li>
<b>Multiple attachments in different languages:</b> can now be viewed without
changing the charset menu if each attachment's header contains a correct
charset parameter. If you send a message with multiple attachments and
if each attachment is a document with a meta charset tag, Mozilla will
create a content-type charset parameter for each attachment from the meta-tag
information.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="mailchardet"></a><b>Japanese attachments and auto-detection:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The auto-detection module set for the Browser via its Auto-Detect&nbsp;
menu work to detect the charset of mail attachments. See <a href="#chardet">above</a>
on how to set an charset detection module.</li>

<li>
Currently there is a bug which corrupts Japanese EUC-JP attachment display.
To work around this problem, we have put in a mail specific charset detector
which only works in Messenger under Windows only. (Note: Eventually this
detector will be removed when the EUC bug is fixed.) When this is set,
this detector rather than the Browser detector will be used in Messenger.&nbsp;
This detector will be ON even when the Browser detector is OFF. For those
wishing to view Japanese EUC files attached to mail messages, we recommend
that this workaround be put in place. There is no UI for this but this
is how you can use it:</li>

<ul>
<li>
In the <b>pres.js file, </b>insert the following line:</li>

<ul>
<li>
user_pref("mail.charset.detector", "jaclassic");&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- this
is basically a detector module used for Communicator 4.x.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Printing: </b>Basic printing is enabled. Currently it is rather primitive.
Headers don't seem to be printed -- only body text.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu and thread pane reloading:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
The menu change causes the thread pane to reload properly. This makes it
possible to display non-MIME-encoded headers which don't match the current
Character Set menu setting.&nbsp; Headers, body, and attachments without
MIME charset information may not be displayed properly, however, even if
the Character Set menu is changed.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>IMAP Latin 1 folder name:</b> displays OK. Multi-byte folder names (e.g.
CJK) don't work yet.</li>

<li>
<b>International Sorting in Thread pane headers:&nbsp;</b> now works well
in the <b>Subject </b>headers on all platforms. CJK characters are not
displayed correctly in the <b>Sender </b>field and therefore cannot be
tested. Sorting should be done according to the sort default for the language
of your operating system. Date/Time sorting is also working as it should.</li>

<li>
<b>International Date/Time format:&nbsp;</b> now works for NT4, Win9x,
and Mac for all locales. The format will be used according to your OS's
date/time format setting.</li>

<li>
<b>Linux sorting:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
There seems to be a problem with Latin 1 sort -- this is under investigation.</li>

<li>
Also sorting is working for some Japanese locale names but not others.
It might have to do with locale name aliasing. This problem is under investigation.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">Sending Latin 1 &amp; Japanese attachments/pages:</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>File | Send Page</b> is now working in M11 in addition to attaching
a local file to a message.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Send-related bugs:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
When the Subject header contains more than a certain number of characters,
MIME-encoding fails to occur and raw UTF-8 headers will be sent. Such headers
will not be viewable except under UTF-8 encoding. This problem was fixed
in M12. In M11, you might want to keep non-ASCII headers fairly short.</li>

<li>
Under HTML send option, if you reply/auto-quote on a msg and then cancel
without inputting at least one character into the text body, Mozilla will
crash. If you decide to cancel this type of message, input a few characters
into the text body before you cancel. This bug will be fixed in M12.</li>

<li>
If you reply/quote a message which has an attachment bearing a meta-charset
document tag, Mozilla may crash.</li>

<li>
The original sender's name in CJK will be quoted only as dots. This problem
was fixed in M12.</li>

<li>
When you use Plain Text send option and Reply/quote a message, you may
see strange characters at the beginning or the end of each quoted line.
These characters will disappears when you send the message and therefore
harmless but they are nonetheless impediments to editing.</li>

<li>
In Forwarding inline an attached web page, contents except the URL links
may be lost.</li>
</ul>

entities. However, certain special characters not in the chosen encoding
will be turned into CERs (so-called HTML entities) or NCRs (numeric character
references).</li>

<li>
In sending 8-bit range characters with Plain Text mail, we will generally
use 8-bit characters rather than QP-encoded characters. Those characters
not in the chosen encoding, e.g. the EURO under ISO-8859-1 is currently
turned into a "?" symbol. We are considering more user-friendly spec for
this currently.</li>
