The Unix GTK scrollable menu is not ready yet at  M6. 
For 15 or 17 inch monitor users, this means that the Character Set 
menu may not be visible completely. The files in this directory
are meant to help you remedy this problem. This is just a temporary 
solution until the real usable menu is done for Mozilla.

Use the .txt files. Just copy the 2 sections in the .txt files into your current
navigator.xul, mailshell.xul, or msgcompose.xul files and replace the ENTITY
definitions and Menu definitions sections with what's in the .txt files. 

Each .xul file uses different ways to describe the Character Set menus. 
I've added some menu items not found in the M6 build. Also I standardized 
names to what we will be using in the final product.

I've placed .xul files here from the 5/21/99 M6 Linux build. 
They probably should not be used in the released M6 build.
These files were placed to serve as examples for you.

If you would like to see what the suggested menus looks like,
take a look at the .gif image file which shows the effect of
the changes in the navigator.xul file.
