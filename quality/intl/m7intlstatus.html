<center><b><font size=+2>International M7 Status Page</font></b></center>

<p>by Katsuhiko Momoi
<br>Last Update: 7/1/99
<p>This page tracks the progress of M7 International features.&nbsp; By
the time M7 is completed, this page should have all the M7 features and
testing hints. If you are interested in what has been completed in the
prior Milestone. Visit the <a href="m6intlstatus.html">M6 international
status and testing hints</a> page.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>M7 International features that
have been completed:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>General:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
If you have used an earlier version of Mozilla 5.0, we recommend that you
delete the file called <b>mozregistry.dat (Win) or registry (Unix/Mac)
</b>before you run M7 apprunner. (Don't delete <b>Netscape Registry</b>
file for Mac, which is for Communicator 4.x.)&nbsp; This will avoid unnecessary
problems/crashes in some cases. Read the section in the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/m7.html">Release
Notes</a> called <b>Files Used or Created</b> to find out where you can
find these files.</li>

<li>
Also read the Installation instructions for your platform carefully in
the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/m7.html">Release
Notes</a>.</li>

<li>
When you start M7 after having deleted <b>mozregistry.dat or registry,
</b>you will be asked to create a new profile. If you name an existing
profile, that profile will be used. Otherwise "Default" profile will be
created. If this latter happens, you can replace the prefs50.js file in
the Default folder with the one from an existing profile directory.</li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">If you want to report international bugs, use the
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>. If you have a question,
post a news article to: <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.qa.i18n">netscape.public.mozilla.qa.i18n</a>.</font></li>
</ul>
<b><font size=+1>Browser:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Unix charset support now on par with Win and Mac!:&nbsp;</b> In addition
to the ones we have supported since M5 on Unix, i.e., iso-8859-1, jis_0212-1990,&nbsp;
we have enabled font display support for all the other languages/charsets
for which there are converters except Armenian, Thai, and Vietnamese. The
display for these charsets should also work for mail messages. The list
of the supported charsets at M7 can be found <a href="#charlist">below</a>.
<font color="#FF0000">Please download the binary and check out our support
for these character sets. </font>(Note: You need appropriate fonts to display
these languages -- pcf.gz format on Linux. Visit <a href="http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859.html">this
site</a> for ISO and Cyrillic BDF fonts, and <a href="ftp://ftp.etl.go.jp/pub/mule/fonts/">this
site</a> for multi-byte language fonts. For converting from BDF to PCF
format fonts, use <b>bdftopcf</b> utility.)</li>

<li>
<b>New converters have been added to all platforms</b>: Not all are shown
in the Character Set menu but they can be enabled by simple modification
of appropriate .xul files. See below the item named <b>View | Character
Set menu </b>for details on how to modify these files. M7 additions are
marked in red in <a href="#charlist">the list</a> appended below.</li>

<li>
<b>On Mac:</b> At M6, multi-font rendering code was re-written to improve
on display performance. We would like people to continue to evaluate performance
for this feature, particularly performance/speed issues in loading. If
you find performance problems, please <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">file
a bug</a>.</li>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu:&nbsp;</b> You can switch to different Character
coding upon encountering a page which does not have a&nbsp; meta charset
tag. <font color="#FF0000">You will not see a checkmark next to the menu
item yet, however.</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
The list is currently too long and unwieldy -- overall charset menu specs
are under consideration.</li>

<ul>
<li>
On Unix, there is no scrollable menu yet in GTK. Thus the Character set
menu items may not be all visible if your monitor screen size is 17 or
15 inches. For those people, we would like to offer temporary workaround
with reorganized menus.&nbsp; These modifications on <b>navigator.xul,mailshell.xul</b>,
and <b>msgcompose.xul</b> can be found <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/intl/m6/unixchamenu">here</a>.&nbsp;
They have been tested to work on a 15-inch monitor screen. Please use the
".txt" files which contain just the International menu modifications for
each of the .xul files. The .xul files there were from the 5/21/99 Linux
build and posted simply as an example of how the whole thing looks. (Cf.
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/intl/m6/unixchamenu/charmenusample.gif">this
image</a>.) Do not use these files with the build you downloaded - just
consult them for your own modification.</li>

<li>
You can edit these files yourself to suit your needs using what you find
at the above site as an example. Look for a section which begins: &lt;menu
name="Default Character Set"> or&nbsp; &lt;menu name="Character Set"> and
place the Character set items you want to the top of the list. You will
find the 3 files to modify in the locations below:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Starting at where the apprunner binary is located: ../res/samples/navigator.xul</li>

<li>
Starting at where the apprunner binary is located: ../res/mailnews/messenger/mailshell.xul</li>

<li>
Starting at where the apprunner binary is located: ../res/mailnews/compose/msgcompose.xul</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
On some NT4 machines, reloading may not work. This problem will be addressed
when the new NetLib code becomes available.&nbsp; As workarounds:</li>

<ul>
<li>
If you have one of these machines, switch the View | Character Set menu
before you go to the next site. Hopefully you know ahead of time what charset
the page is using. Another workaround is to delete all the files except
the <b>fat.db</b> file in the <b>cache</b> directory which is in the same
directory as the <b>apprunner</b> program. If you experience the same problem
of not being able to reload, add your comments to <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5665">Bug
5665</a>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Bug fixes include:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Mac HTML buttons now display non-ASCII text.</li>

<li>
The parser no longer strips out Unicode U+xx00 from html attribute.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size=+1>Editor:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Mac Editor and Mail composer</b>: (Note: Current editor widgets will
soon be replaced by the new Ender/Editor widgets and many improvements
are expected at that time, but <font color="#FF0000">the following international
input methods and keyboards are working with the current widgets!</font>)
Try them out with your international keyboards on MacOS 8.5 or later.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>CJK IMEs</b>.</li>

<li>
<b>Keyboards for many one-byte languages:</b> Roman Australian,&nbsp; Brazilian,
British, Canadian-CSA, Canadian-ISO, Canadian-French, Dutch, dv-Dvorak,
dq-Dvorak-Qwerty, Finnish, Flemish, French, French-numerical, German, Italian,
Norwegian, Spanish, Spanish-ISO, Swedish, Swiss French, Swiss German, Cyrillic
Bulgarian, Cyrillic-Qwerty, Russian, Ukrainian.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>On Win and Mac:</b> there have been a number of international bug fixes
for M7 to generally improve editing documents and mail. Try out the editors
on these platforms, you will see improvement in cursor handling, CJK IME
interactions, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b><font size=+1>Localizability:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
Some do-it-yourself localization is possible. Not much change in the following
items from M5.</li>

<ul>
<li>
XUL/XML/RDF files assume the default charset to be in UTF-8. If you change
UI strings to your favorite language, they should show OK as long as the
localized files use UTF-8 charset. (You can change menus to Japanese, for
example, in <b>res/samples/navigator.xul </b>file and then convert the
file to UTF-8.) The menu items generally cannot be in languages your system
does not support, e.g.&nbsp; no Japanese menu for US Windows is possible
at the moment.</li>

<li>
<b>Limitation:</b> you cannot use charsets other than UTF-8 yet since XML
parser support for general entities in the external DTD files is yet to
be done. Although it is possible to have resource files for Mozilla to
be in charsets other than UTF-8, keep in mind that Mozilla will be standardizing
on UTF-8 for&nbsp; resource files.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size=+1>Mail/News (Testing done on Windows only):</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Preferences file: prefs50.js</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">Important: </font></b>Though this may not be documented
elsewhere, if you want to display mail messages on Windows platforms, you
must have an existing directory called "C:\Temp". It must be this exact
name - "C:\Tmp", for example, will not do -&nbsp; and it must exist on
the C drive. If the directory with this name does not exist on your C drive,
create one yourself because Mozilla at present cannot display a message
unless it can create a temporary file in this directory. This requirement
will go away once the new Netlib (Necko) gets incoporated into the source
later.</li>

<li>
Mail (POP &amp; IMAP) and News viewing does not work unless you have a
correct <b>prefs50.js</b> file in the correct location for your platform.
Read <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews/prefs-info.html">this page
</a>and set up the correct preferences before you do any mail testing.
For the location of the <b>prefs50.js</b> file, read the installation instructions
for your platform on this page - see above.</li>

<li>
In addition to the general preferences items, international users should
also add the following 3 lines to the <b>prefs50.js</b>. The first controls
HTML/Plain Text mail option, the second and the third are musts for sending
out properly MIME-encoded mail body and headers, respectively. If you want
to send HTML mail, set the first option's value to "true". For M7, our
default is Plain Text since HTML mail has problems for some languages,
e.g. Japanese.&nbsp; HTML mail is working well for Latin 1 and probably
other languages supported in the Character Set menu for Mail Composer.&nbsp;
Here are the relevant prefs50.js settings.</li>

<ul>
<li>
user_pref("mail.identity.id1.send_html", false);</li>

<li>
user_pref("mail.strictly_mime", true);</li>

<li>
user_pref("mail.strictly_mime_headers", true);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
//No need to set this line unless you want a false value.</li>
</ul>

<li>
To get your POP mail working, it is best to have a small starter <b>Inbox</b>
file in the Mail directory you specified in <b>prefs50.js</b> file. We
have such a starter Inbox file for you <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/intl/m6/">here</a>.
Get this file called <b>5.0firstinbox</b> and rename it to <b>Inbox</b>
and put it in your Mail directory.</li>

<li>
The POP option is for leaving mail behind on the server after the messages
have been downloaded. We recommend that you use a test mail account for
this purpose rather than using your regular mail account.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Japanese attachments auto-detection working in M7: </b>There is no need
to set Character Set menu for Japanese file attachments. We use auto-detection
to display them correctly. Display of non-ASCII attachment names is working
with the exception of the name used in the link.</li>

<li>
<b>International Sorting in Thread pane headers: </b>is now working but
there are some known problems. Sorting should be done according to the
sort default for the language of your operating system. Please test this
for your language/OS and see if sorting is satisfactory. Date/Time sorting
is currently done alphabetically and will not be all that accurate.</li>

<li>
<b>International Date/Time format: </b>is now working. It uses the default
for your operating system's locale. The effect should be visible in the
thread pane date/time headers and will follow your current system setting
option.&nbsp; Please check out this features for your language/OS!</li>

<li>
<b>Multi-lingual mail viewing: </b><font color="#FF0000">This is working
on all platforms.</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
Multi-lingual viewing is now working on Linux.</li>

<li>
View | Character Set menu is currently not working to override wrong MIME
charset label, or view msgs which have no MIME charset (except for Latin
1) specified.</li>

<li>
If you have a multilingual font or several fonts which together cover the
Unicode ranges (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Korean fonts + Pan-European fonts),
we use them in displaying mail messages and headers for all the languages
we support. We pay attention to the charset parameter in the Content-Type
header and switch to an appropriate font. The Character Set menu is not
needed to switch to different language views unless the message you're
viewing is incorrectly labeled. If you would like a basic mono-weight multi-lingual
font, you can get Bitstream Cyberbit font 2.0 <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/extras/fonts/windows/">here</a>.</li>

<li>
Attachments should be viewable if they are of the same charset as the main
body of the mail. Other charsets are not supported yet.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>View | Character Set menu for New Mail Compose window</b> is working
for sending mail for many additional languages. Switch to the charset you
want to compose a message in and then compose the message.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">You
will not see a checkmark next to the menu item yet, however.</font></li>

<li>
<b>IMAP Mail:</b> is now working. All <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/smoketests/">international
Smoketests</a> are passing for IMAP. You can change the server type to
"<b>imap</b>" from "<b>POP3</b>" to indicate that the server in question
is of IMAP type in your prefs50.js file.</li>

<li>
<b>Sending Latin 1 Mail: </b>Works in both HTML and Plain text.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Latin 1 8-bit input in body now uses HTML entities (as in Communicator
4.x).</li>

<li>
Copying/pasting accented characters into the headers and&nbsp; body works</li>

<li>
Keyboard input into headers (e.g. subject) also works for accented characters.
Using the English keyboard for Latin 1 high-bit input, ALTGr + 0+Number
Keypad method works, e.g. Right ALT key + 0232.</li>

<li>
Make sure to switch the <b>View | Character Set</b>&nbsp; to your chosen
Character set name before you send out a message.</li>

<li>
Basic MIME compliance is there: Header Q encoding, and Body QP encoding
for accented characters.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Sending Japanese mail: </b>works only in Plain text. HTML mail body
disappears upon "send".</li>

<ul>
<li>
Basic Japanese input now works well -- some improvements in this area in
M7.&nbsp; Japanese input/copying&nbsp; into Subject header does not work
yet, however. We are awaiting the arrival of new Ender/Editor widgets for
this feature.</li>

<li>
Mail goes out in ISO-2022-JP.&nbsp; Header is B-encoded. (The Kanji-in
escape sequence is now correct -- that of JISX0208-1990/83. )</li>

<li>
Make sure to switch the <b>View | Character Set&nbsp;</b> to Japanese (ISO-2022-JP)
before you send out a message.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Sending other charset mail</b> --<font color="#FF0000"> is enabled.</font>
Please try out these new charsets! For example,<b> Central European, Cyrillic,
Greek, UTF-8, etc.</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Though the mail text body can sense what keyboard you have selected and
will switch font accordingly, there may be mapping bugs with some international
keyboards.&nbsp; Copy/paste may work better. If you find a bug with your
charset/language, please file it <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b>Reply/Forward: </b>is basically working but there are some non-ASCII
display bugs in the new mail composer. You may not always see the characters
displayed properly in&nbsp; your language in Mail Composer though mail
generally gets sent out correctly.</li>

<li>
<b>Viewing News: </b>is working. We have done some&nbsp; international
testing on this. In principle, multilingual news articles viewing should
work if they have correct MIME charsets indicated in the articles. Be warned,
however, that newsgroups postings are not always MIME-compliant and this
could defeat our charset honoring mechanism.</li>

<li>
<b>Bug fixes include:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Latin 1 Character Entity References (CER) are now used in HTML mail</li>

<li>
Cyrillic body display now works.</li>

<li>
ISO-202-JP Kanji-in escape sequence now uses JISX208-1990/83 type.</li>

<li>
vCard viewing for Latin 1 accented characters now working. Viewing for
CJK is not.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font size=+1>Mail/News (for Mac and Linux)</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
We don't currently test these platforms for international features. Though
we cannot vouch for accuracy, many of our Windows features should be available
on these platforms also.&nbsp; Linux mail is somewhat behind Windows and
Mac, however.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Features that are not supported in M7:</h4>

<ul>
<li>
No CJK IME support on Linux.</li>

<li>
No Japanese Auto-Detect in browsing.</li>

<li>
No posting non-ASCII forms data.</li>

<li>
No CJK printing on Linux.</li>

<li>
HTTP charset won't be handled -- until new NetLib (Necko) is integrated.</li>
