<h1>Mozilla Relicensing FAQ</h1>

<div class=version>
Version 1.0<br>
</div>

<p>Some time ago mozilla.org announced its intent to seek relicensing of
Mozilla code under a new licensing scheme that would address perceived
incompatibilities of the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html">Mozilla Public License</a>
(MPL) and
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/NPL-1.1.html">Netscape Public License</a>
(NPL) with the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
(GPL). Many people provided useful comments on this proposal, and in
particular identified Mozilla-related license issues that could arise with
developers using the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General Public License</a>
(LGPL) for their own code.</p>

<p>Based on those comments and further discussions with Mozilla contributors,
we have now implemented the first phase of Mozilla relicensing, using an
NPL/GPL/LGPL "triple license" for Mozilla source files previously licensed under
the NPL and for some files currently licensed under an NPL/GPL dual license.
In the next phases of this effort we will seek to have the remaining source files
under an NPL/GPL dual license be relicensed under an NPL/GPL/LGPL triple license,
and have source files under the MPL or an MPL/GPL dual license be relicensed
under an MPL/GPL/LGPL triple license. This FAQ addresses various questions that
might arise specifically about this relicensing effort. For additional
information about the new Mozilla licensing scheme, see the new
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/license-policy.html">mozilla.org License Policy</a>.

<h2>Details of the Relicensing</h2>

<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="why-relicensing">Why is Mozilla
code being relicensed?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>Primarily to address concerns about whether the Mozilla licensing scheme
is "compatible" with the GPL and LGPL.</p>

<p>After the NPL and MPL were created, the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/fsf/fsf.html">Free Software Foundation</a>
stated
that the NPL and MPL were "incompatible" with the GPL. "Incompatibility" in
this context means that (in the opinion of the FSF) developers who combined
code licensed under the NPL (or MPL) with code licensed under the GPL and
distributed the resulting work could not do such distribution without
violating the terms of the GPL. Given that the LGPL contains similar
language to the GPL, if the MPL were in fact incompatible in this way with
the GPL, it would arguably be incompatible with the LGPL as well.</p>

<p>(The LGPL allows code released under LGPL terms to be combined in
certain specified ways with code released under non-LGPL terms, as for
example when releasing an application using a library consisting of code
released under the LGPL. However the relevant LGPL provisions do not
address all possible ways in which code released under the MPL and code
released under the LGPL could be combined to form a larger work. In
particular, when linking Mozilla source files directly into a library
released under the LGPL, e.g., to extend the functionality of that library,
the effect of the LGPL terms, and any potential license incompatibilities
that might arise, appear to be similar to those associated with the
GPL.)</p>

<p>It is unclear whether a developer could be successfully sued for copyright
infringement on grounds related to these perceived license incompatibilities.
However, to eliminate possible uncertainties concerning this question,
and to address the concerns of developers who wished to use Mozilla code
in applications whose code was otherwise licensed under the GPL or LGPL, we
decided to seek relicensing of the Mozilla code to address the perceived
license incompatibilities for both the GPL and the LGPL.</p>

<p>We are also repeating and reinforcing mozilla.org's policy that the NPL
(either alone or in the form of an NPL-based dual or triple license) should
<em>not</em> be used for new source files checked into the Mozilla source
tree. Instead the new MPL/GPL/LGPL triple license described
<a href="#new-license">below</a>
should be used for all new files checked into the tree, unless you have
specific instructions from mozilla.org to do otherwise. This applies
to all Mozilla contributors; for more information see the new
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/license-policy.html">mozilla.org
License Policy</a>.</p>

<p>The purpose of the NPL was to assist Netscape in its moving from a
proprietary code base to an open source code base; during this period use
of the NPL allowed Netscape to maintain its obligations under existing
proprietary source code licensing arrangements with third parties, and
avoid licensing problems with using Mozilla-related modules such as NSPR
in Netscape's proprietary server products. The NPL will continue to be
used with existing files already under the NPL or an NPL-based dual or
triple license; however it should not be used in new files.</p>

<p>(In this connection, it has come to our attention that many developers
creating new Mozilla source files simply cut and paste a license header
from another file with which they are familiar; in doing this developers
have sometimes improperly licensed new files under the wrong license(s).
When and if you add new Mozilla source files to the mozilla.org-hosted
repository, please verify that the appropriate license notice is present
in accordance with the
<a href="#new-license">new licensing scheme</a>.)</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="new-license">What is the new Mozilla
licensing scheme?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>The new standard licensing scheme is an MPL/GPL/LGPL triple license; it should
be used for new Mozilla source files distributed through mozilla.org, and
for existing files after obtaining the necessary permissions. (A similar
NPL/GPL/LGPL triple license will be used for existing source files licensed
under the NPL or under an NPL/GPL dual license.)</p>

<p>The MPL/GPL/LGPL triple license is an extension and variant of the
dual license schemes
already used with some Mozilla code, including NSPR, NSS, PSM, and the
JavaScript engine. The principal differences are that we are using the
LGPL as an alternate license in the triple license scheme, in addition
to the GPL,
and we are discouraging use of the NPL for new source files.

<p>The following is the recommended MPL/GPL/LGPL license notice for new
Mozilla source code files; this would be formatted as a comment in
whatever language is used in a particular source file:</p>

<p>Except as described below,
the MPL/GPL/LGPL notice will also be used in existing Mozilla source files
to replace the original license notice, once the necessary permissions
have been obtained; this includes Mozilla source files previously
licensed under the MPL (solely) or under an MPL/GPL dual license.</p>

<p>Existing files licensed under the NPL will be relicensed
using an NPL/GPL/LGPL triple license; the NPL/GPL/LGPL license notice is
similar to the notice above, but references the NPL rather than the MPL.
(We are also relicensing under the NPL/GPL/LGPL triple license some existing
files licensed under an NPL/GPL dual license; we will seek to relicense
the rest of those files in a later phase.) Finally, we will
not seek to relicense Mozilla source files already licensed under some
other license approved by mozilla.org. (See the
<a href="#not-to-be-relicensed">question</a>
below.)</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="to-be-relicensed">What Mozilla code
will be relicensed?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>We will seek to relicense all source code which is included in
the Mozilla source code distributions distributed through mozilla.org
and is used to create the Mozilla binary distributions distributed
through mozilla.org. We will not necessarily relicense all source
code available from the mozilla.org CVS repository.</p>

<p>Our primary goal is to ensure that the source code needed to build
Mozilla binary distributions is available under a suitable license
(or licenses). Thus we will focus on relicensing source code which is
included in
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/source.html">Mozilla source code
distributions</a> released through mozilla.org. (An example of such a
distribution is the
<a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/releases/mozilla0.9.3/src/mozilla-source-0.9.3.tar.gz">source
tarball for the 0.9.3 milestone</a>.)</p>

<p>In particular, all of the following Mozilla source directories
(under the <code>mozilla</code> top-level directory) contain
some source files which we will seek to relicense where necessary:</p>

<pre class=faq-code>
accessible
build

xpcom

xpinstall
</pre>

<p>(Note that not all files in these directories will necessarily be relicensed;
see the
<a href="#not-to-be-relicensed">question below</a>.)</p>

<p>At this time we will <em>not</em> seek to relicense other source code
which is distributed through mozilla.org but is not included in current
versions of Mozilla itself. This includes source code for
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bugzilla/">Bugzilla</a>,
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/bonsai.html">Bonsai</a>,
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tinderbox">Tinderbox</a>,
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/grendel/">Grendel</a>,
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ef/">ElectricalFire</a>,
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a>
and "Mozilla Classic" (i.e., the original Netscape Communicator source code
released in 1998); this source code will remain under its existing
license(s) for now.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="already-relicensed">What Mozilla code
has already been relicensed?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>Mozilla source files previously released under the NPL (along with some
source files released under an NPL/GPL dual license), for which Netscape
had the right to relicense code contributed by others.</p>

<p>AOL Time Warner management has approved changing the Mozilla licensing
scheme to address the GPL/LGPL incompatibility issues for Mozilla code copyright by
Netscape. As it happens, for source files licensed under the NPL Section
V.3 of the NPL ("Alternative Licensing") allows Netscape and now AOL Time
Warner to relicense those files, including any code contributed by others,
to third parties under other license terms (i.e., other than the NPL
terms).</p>

<p>We have taken advantage of this provision in order to change the licensing
on Mozilla source files currently licensed under the NPL; the new license for
such files is an NPL/GPL/LGPL triple license similar to the MPL/GPL/LGPL license
<a href="#new-license">previously</a> described.
We have also taken advantage of this provision in order to change the licensing
on some Mozilla source files currently licensed under the NPL/GPL, including
the JavaScript engine source code in the <code>js</code> directory; again the
new license will also be an NPL/GPL/LGPL triple license. (We have not relicensed
all source code currently under an NPL/GPL dual license, because we have not
yet obtained all the necessary permissions to do so.)</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="not-yet-relicensed">What Mozilla code
remains to be relicensed?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>Source files currently under the MPL and the MPL/GPL dual license, where
additional permissions are required from non-Netscape contributors in order
to relicense code, as well as some remaining source files still under an
NPL/GPL dual license.</p>

<p>As noted in a
<a href="#already-relicensed">previous question</a>,
AOL Time Warner has approved changing
the Mozilla licensing scheme to address the GPL/LGPL incompatibility issues for
code copyright by Netscape. This means that source files currently
licensed under the MPL or an MPL/GPL dual license can now be relicensed
under the MPL/GPL/LGPL triple license, if (and only if) all the code in the file
is copyright by Netscape. However in cases where source files contain contributed
code not copyright by Netscape, we must seek and obtain the permission of the
copyright holders for that code in order to change the licensing.</p>

<p>Thus we will need to determine the (non-Netscape) copyright holders
for each source file under the MPL (or MPL/GPL), and contact the copyright
holders to ask permission to relicense the code under the MPL/GPL/LGPL triple
license. While this task can be automated to some degree
it will still require human intervention, and thus may take some time to
complete. After we determine the copyright holders for a given source file
and obtain the necessary permissions, we will change the licensing for that
file to the MPL/GPL/LGPL triple license described
<a href="#new-license">above</a>.</p>

<p>We also intend to seek relicensing for the rest of the source files still
under an NPL/GPL dual license; such files would be relicensed under an
NPL/GPL/LGPL triple license.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="not-to-be-relicensed">Will the original
licenses be retained for any Mozilla code?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>Yes, for certain contributed source files that are under other licenses
(i.e., neither the NPL, MPL, nor NPL- or MPL-based dual or triple licenses) that are
already compatible with the GPL and LGPL.</p>

<p>Some existing Mozilla source files are licensed under licenses based
on the (modified)
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html">BSD
license</a>,
the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT
license</a>, or similar licenses;
examples of such source files include the JPEG library code. We
do not see any reason to seek relicensing of code under such licenses,
since the terms of the licenses in question are already compatible with
all of the MPL, GPL, and LGPL, and also allow inclusion of the code
into proprietary software (in accordance with the intent of the Mozilla
licensing arrangements).</p>

<p>Mozilla source directories (under the <code>mozilla</code> top-level
directory) containing code under such other licenses
include (but are not necessarily limited to) the following:</p>

<pre class=faq-code>
dbm
expat
gc/boehm
jpeg
modules/libimg/mng
modules/libimg/png
modules/zlib
xpcom/typelib/xpidl/
</pre>

<p>Except for makefiles added as part of the Mozilla build procedures
(which will be licensed using the new licensing scheme) all files in
these directories should remain under their original licenses.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="no-license-notice">What about Mozilla
source files that do not have an explicit license notice?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>Any such files created by Netscape employees will be assumed to
be under the NPL and thus relicensed automatically, while for other
files the contributor(s) will be contacted to request permission
for relicensing.</p>

<p>Many Mozilla source files do not have an explicit license notice
(or an explicit copyright notice, for that matter). Relicensing for
such files will be done as follows:</p>

<p>If the file in question was originally created by a Netscape
developer, then we will assume that the intended license was the
NPL (or possibly an NPL/GPL dual license, depending on the source
directory in which the file is located), and the file will be
considered to be automatically relicensed under an NPL/GPL/LGPL triple
license.</p>

<p>If the file in question was not created by a Netscape employee,
then we will assume that the intended license was not the NPL (or
an NPL/GPL dual license), and we will contact the contributor(s)
for permission to relicense the file.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Getting Permissions to Relicense</h2>

<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="why-use-special-rights">Why didn't
you ask permission from non-Netscape contributors to relicense code
originally licensed under the NPL, instead of using the
NPL "special rights" provision?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>Because by granting permission for their code to be licensed under
the NPL non-Netscape contributors already have implicitly
given such permission.</p>

<p>When contributors originally contributed code under the NPL
(e.g., as a patch to an existing source file licensed under
the NPL) they knew (or could have easily discovered by reading various
information sources) that the NPL granted special rights to Netscape
(and now AOL Time Warner) to relicense their contributed code to third
parties under other licenses. By choosing to contribute their code
anyway, contributors implicitly gave permission for their code to
be relicensed in this manner. Because this permission was already
(implicitly) granted for any arbitrary relicensing, in the interests
of saving time and effort we did not seek to gain permission for
relicensing under an NPL/GPL/LGPL triple license.</p>

<p>We believe that doing this is arguably fair to contributors, since
the new licensing scheme grants rights comparable to those granted under
the previous license.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="why-grant-permission">If I have
contributed code to Mozilla under the MPL (or MPL/GPL), why should
I grant my permission for this change in license?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>Because granting such permission would arguably be consistent with
your having granted permission previously to license your code under
the MPL (or MPL/GPL), and because by doing so you will make the
Mozilla code useful to more people, which may result in others improving
Mozilla to make it more useful to you.</p>

<p>The licensing schemes used for Mozilla code have always had two major
features: They have required that people make source code available
for modifications to Mozilla code, and they have allowed combining
Mozilla code with proprietary code to create and distribute proprietary
products. Anyone contributing code to the Mozilla project under the
"standard" licenses (i.e., licenses using the NPL or MPL in some form)
has in effect consented to their code being distributed under these
general terms.</p>

<p>The new Mozilla license scheme (i.e., the MPL/GPL/LGPL triple license) is
arguably consistent with the prior schemes: It too requires that people
make source code available for modifications to Mozilla code (this is
required whether licensees use the code under MPL, GPL, or LGPL terms), and
it too allows Mozilla code to be used in proprietary programs (this is
allowed by the MPL, and also allowed by the LGPL in certain cases). So
in this respect the new licensing scheme is comparable to the prior
schemes for which you have already granted permission to use your
contributed code, and granting permission to use the MPL/GPL/LGPL triple
license for your code would thus be consistent with your prior grant of
permission.</p>

<p>By permitting your code to be relicensed your code you will also
help make the Mozilla code useful to a larger community of users and
developers. As a result there may be more improvements made to
Mozilla and more Mozilla-based applications created, improvements
and new applications which may be of future benefit to you.</p>

<p>We will be creating lists of (non-Netscape) contributors who
have contributed code to Mozilla files under the MPL or the MPL/GPL
dual license, and asking those contributors to grant permission to
relicense their code under the MPL/GPL/LGPL triple license. If you have

permission to have all your code be relicensed in this way, please
send an email message to

</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="permission-not-granted">What will you do
if some contributors do not give permission to relicense their contributed
code?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>We will continue to include such code in the Mozilla source code
distribution, until
and unless we can find another contributor willing to contribute substitute
code under the MPL/GPL/LGPL triple license. </p>

<p>As previously discussed, in cases where Mozilla source files are currently
distributed under the MPL (or a dual license based on the MPL), if those
files contain contributed code not copyright by Netscape then we must seek
and obtain the permission of the copyright holders for that code in order
to change the licensing. In the meantime those files will continue to be
distributed through mozilla.org and can continue to be used under their
existing licenses.</p>

<p>Our goal is eventually to have all Mozilla source files distributed
through mozilla.org relicensed under the MPL/GPL/LGPL or NPL/GPL/LGPL
triple licenses (or other suitable licenses, as
<a href="#not-to-be-relicensed">previously described)</a>. It is
possible that there may be Mozilla source files containing contributed
code for which the copyright holders refuse to grant permission for
relicensing under the MPL/GPL/LGPL triple license. In those cases we will
investigate whether the situation can be resolved by someone writing
new code to replace the code which cannot be relicensed. (This may
require writing a complete new source file, or simply rewriting one
or more portions of an existing file.)</p>

<p>If such files remain under their current licenses, then there are
two possible outcomes: If one or more of the files in question are
currently licensed under the MPL (only), then code in those files may
be used by developers creating and distributing Mozilla-based products
under the MPL or proprietary licenses, but may not be used by developers
creating and distributing software under the LGPL or GPL. If one or
more of the files in question are currently licensed under the MPL/GPL
dual license, then code in those files may be used by developers creating
and distributing Mozilla-based products under the MPL, the GPL, or
proprietary licenses, but may not be used by developers creating and
distributing software under the LGPL.</p>

<h2>Our Approach to Relicensing</h2>

<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="why-npl">Why didn't you completely
eliminate use of the NPL?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>Because we don't yet have all the necessary permissions from AOL
Time Warner that we would need in order to do so.</p>

<p>In the longer term we would like to phase out use of the NPL
in the Mozilla code base. However at this time we have not yet
secured all of the necessary permissions we need in order to do
this. If and when we do get such permission, we would have Mozilla
files under an NPL/GPL/LGPL triple license relicensed under the MPL/GPL/LGPL
triple license. (Files released under other NPL-based licenses, e.g.,
the NPL by itself or an NPL/GPL dual license, are slated to be
changed to an NPL/GPL/LGPL triple license as part of the first phase of
relicensing.)
</div>
</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="why-not-mpl-gpl">Why didn't you use an
MPL/GPL dual license, as originally announced?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>Because an MPL/GPL dual license would not allow developers to use
Mozilla code in a library distributed under the LGPL.</p>

<p>Some people would like to be able to include Mozilla code in programs
where the other code is licensed under the GPL, and then distribute the
resulting derived work under GPL terms and conditions (as required by
the GPL). Other people would like to be able to include Mozilla code in
libraries and other works where the other code is licensed under the
LGPL, and then distribute the resulting derived works under LGPL terms
and conditions.</p>

<p>Our problem then became, how could Mozilla licensing be arranged in
order to make both scenarios possible? After considering public comments
we concluded that the previously
proposed MPL/GPL dual licensing scheme would not be sufficient. If a
person were to combine such dual-licensed Mozilla code with their own
code (where that code was licensed under the LGPL) and use the MPL
licensing option offered for the Mozilla code, they would arguably
encounter the same license incompatibility issues as when combining
code under the MPL with code under the GPL. On the other hand, if they
were to combine such Mozilla code with their own code and use the GPL
licensing option offered for the Mozilla code under an MPL/GPL dual
license, then they would have to distribute the resulting work
under GPL terms, not LGPL terms.</p>

<p>Since the people in question presumably chose to use the LGPL (and not
the GPL) for some reason important to them, it would be preferable to
arrange the Mozilla licensing scheme so that they could include Mozilla
code and still use the LGPL for the resulting works. While there are
several potential ways in which this could be done, we believe that the
most straightforward approach is to use an MPL/GPL/LGPL (or NPL/GPL/LGPL)
triple license; this will allow the Mozilla code to be used in software
distributed under LGPL terms and conditions (as a consequence of the LGPL
part of the triple license) and at the same time allow the Mozilla code
to also be used in software distributed under GPL terms and conditions
(as a consequence of the GPL part of the triple license).</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="why-lgpl">The Free Software Foundation
is discouraging use of the LGPL; why is mozilla.org encouraging its
use?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>The goals of the Mozilla project are different than those of the FSF. We
believe that using the LGPL in the new triple license provides advantages to
those developers committed to (or locked into) use of the LGPL, while preserving
freedoms important to software users and those developers using the GPL for
their own software.</p>

<p>The goals of the Free Software Foundation are to promote the creation
of free software and to discourage the creation of proprietary (non-free)
software. Thus the FSF now discourages the use of the LGPL (which allows
free software libraries to be included in proprietary software) and
encourages the licensing of all software under the GPL, so that any
derivative works of that software will also be licensed under those same
GPL terms. However the intent of the Mozilla licensing arrangements has
been and will continue to be to allow Mozilla code to be combined
with other (non-Mozilla code) to create "larger works" which could (if
desired) be distributed under different license terms than those used for
the Mozilla code itself.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, it has always been true, and will continue to be
true, that Mozilla code distributed through mozilla.org can be combined
with other code to create larger works which can be distributed under
proprietary license terms. The original intent behind the changes to the
Mozilla licensing scheme was to allow Mozilla code to be combined with
other code to create larger works which could be distributed under GPL
terms. We believe that any new Mozilla licensing scheme should also allow
Mozilla code to be combined with other code to create larger works which
can be distributed under LGPL terms. We cannot justify allowing such
larger works to be distributed under either proprietary or GPL terms
while at the same time preventing such larger works from being distributed
under LGPL terms.</p>

<p>There would be no problem if in fact Mozilla code under the MPL or
NPL could already be combined with code under the LGPL and the resulting
larger work distributed under LGPL terms. If that were the case then we
would not have to make any special provision for the LGPL in the
new Mozilla scheme. However based on our reading of the LGPL we believe
that if the MPL is incompatible with the GPL (as the FSF claims)
then it is incompatible with the LGPL as well; similar considerations hold
for the NPL. Hence we concluded
that the new Mozilla licensing scheme must accomodate the LGPL as well
as the GPL.</p>

<p>Note that in terms of the freedoms granted to users the MPL/GPL/LGPL
triple license scheme is comparable to the MPL/GPL dual license scheme
originally considered and then rejected. (This is also true for an
NPL/GPL/LGPL triple license as compared to an NPL/GPL dual license.)
Like the original MPL/GPL proposal, the proposed MPL/GPL/LGPL triple license
scheme allows licensees, if they desire, to create nonproprietary derivative
works licensed solely under the GPL (for example, to prevent the use of such
works in conjunction with proprietary or otherwise non-free software). The
MPL/GPL/LGPL license also allows licensees, if they desire, to create
nonproprietary derivative works licensed solely under the LGPL.</p>

<p>Note that although licensees would thus have the freedom to create GPL-only
(or LGPL-only) versions of the Mozilla code base, mozilla.org requests that
licensees using the Mozilla code with other code under the LGPL or GPL retain
the MPL/GPL/LGPL (or NPL/GPL/LGPL) triple license language, and allow use of their
versions of the
Mozilla code under MPL (or NPL) terms as well as under GPL or LGPL terms.
Similarly,
mozilla.org requests that licensees using the Mozilla code with code under the
MPL or NPL (or other licenses other than the GPL or LGPL) also retain the original
MPL/GPL/LGPL (and NPL/GPL/LGPL) triple license language, and allow use of their versions
of the Mozilla code under GPL or LGPL terms as well as under the MPL (or
NPL).</p>

<p>We are requesting this because we believe that the Mozilla code base should
be a common resource available to everyone wishing to use it, and we want to
encourage people to add to that common shared code base for the benefit of all.
To promote this goal, we will not accept new source files into the
mozilla.org-hosted Mozilla source code repository unless they are licensed under
the MPL/GPL/LGPL triple licensing scheme. (In some cases mozilla.org may also accept
code under some other license compatible with all of the MPL, NPL, LGPL, and GPL;
mozilla.org may also accept code under the LGPL only, where that code forms
a library that may be used with other non-LGPL code as described in the LGPL.
However mozilla.org must approve any such license, and may require such code
to be stored in a separate location than the rest of the Mozilla code.)</p>

<p>In particular, we will not accept contributions of code that is licensed solely
under the LGPL or GPL, nor (once relicensing is complete) will we accept
contributions of code that is licensed solely under the MPL or NPL. (At this
point Mozilla contributors should not be creating new source files licensed
under the NPL, either alone or in combination with other licenses; contributors
should use the MPL or an MPL/GPL dual license only when such code is a patch to
an existing file that has not yet been relicensed.)</p>

<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="why-not-mpl-lgpl-gpl">Why didn't you use an
MPL/LGPL dual license? Doesn't the LGPL allow use under GPL terms as
well?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>Using an MPL/LGPL dual license would have caused unnecessary inconvenience
for people wishing to distribute Mozilla code under GPL terms, by requiring
them in some cases to change the license notices on Mozilla source files. An
MPL/GPL/LGPL triple license reduces the potential inconvenience.</p>

<p>One possible licensing scheme would have been to use a dual license
allowing use of the Mozilla code under the terms and conditions of either the
MPL or LGPL; in other words, the GPL would not have been included
explicitly as an alternative license, but use under GPL terms would have
been possible as specified by the LGPL. However after considering the question
we concluded that this approach would cause unnecessary inconvenience for
people wishing to distribute Mozilla code under GPL terms.</p>

<p>For example, consider a Mozilla source file licensed under an MPL/LGPL dual
license; this dual license permits use of the code under either MPL terms or
LGPL terms. Now suppose that a developer wishes to create an application in
which routines in the Mozilla source file will be calling routines in a
separate source file licensed under the GPL. Such an application would have to
be distributed as a whole under GPL terms, so the developer needs permission
to distribute the Mozilla code under GPL terms as part of that overall
application.</p>

<p>Under an MPL/LGPL dual license the developer in question would not have
explicit permission to distribute the code under GPL terms; the explicit
permission would extend only to distribution of the code under LGPL terms.
Therefore the developer would have to elect to use the LGPL part of the dual
license, and then take advantage of any provisions in the LGPL that permit
(re)distribution under GPL terms.</p>

<p>Tthere are two ways in which the LGPL permits distribution under GPL terms.
One approach is to take advantage of Section 6 of the LGPL, which allows
a "Library" distributed under LGPL terms to be (re)distributed under non-LGPL
terms as part of a work combining all or part of the "Library" with a
"work that uses the Library," if the license terms allow modification of
the overall work and meet related criteria. Since the terms of the GPL meet
the criteria in question, this provision would allow a library consisting of
Mozilla code under the hypothetical MPL/LGPL dual license to be distributed
in conjunction with an application consisting of code licensed under the GPL;
the dual license would permit the Mozilla code to be distributed under LGPL
terms, and Section 6 of the LGPL would permit distribution of the entire work
under GPL terms.</p>

<p>But this is not the case in our example, because the Mozilla code is not
being used as a "Library" as that term is defined by the LGPL; instead the
routines in the Mozilla source file are calling routines in the source file
licensed under the GPL (as opposed to being called by those routines). Thus
the developer in our example cannot take advantage of Section 6 of the LGPL,
but must use another LGPL provision allowing distribution under the GPL,
namely Section 3. Section 3 of the LGPL explicitly permits code distributed
under the LGPL to be (re)distributed under the terms of the GPL instead.
However in order to do this the developer must actually alter the license
notice in the Mozilla source file to replace it with a GPL license
notice.</p>

<p>The terms of the hypothetical MPL/LGPL dual license permit this
alteration, but it would be inconvenient for the developer in our example
to do this, especially if the Mozilla code in question consisted not of a
single source file but rather of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of
source files. And this inconvenience is unnecessary: If the Mozilla source
file had been under a license explicitly permitting use of the code under
GPL terms then no license notices would need to be altered.</p>

<p>Therefore we took the approach of using an MPL/GPL/LGPL triple license
(combined with an NPL/GPL/LGPL triple license for existing code under the
NPL). This license scheme explicitly provides for use under GPL terms (as
well as under MPL and LGPL terms), without having to change the license
notice as described above.</p>

</div>
</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="why-not-modify-mpl">Why didn't you modify
the MPL itself to address GPL and LGPL incompatibility, rather than using
a triple license scheme?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>Modifying the MPL itself would have taken more time and effort, and the
Mozilla project (like other projects) was already making use of a multiple
license scheme without apparent problems.</p>

<p>Rather than using a triple license, another possible approach would have
been to create a new version of the MPL (and NPL) containing language that
would
explicitly address the GPL (and LGPL) compatibility issue. (The FSF had
previously suggested such an approach as one way to address perceived
incompatibilities between the NPL and GPL.) However after considering the
question we concluded that modifying the MPL and NPL would be more time
consuming and potentially error prone.</p>

<p>Changing the MPL would also have potentially affected developers who
had adopted the MPL for use with their own code, independently of the
Mozilla project. If those developers did not like the new MPL changes then
they would have to explicitly use an older version of the MPL, or create
their own MPL-based license. (Or, to prevent their having to do this, we
would have had to make the new provisions in the MPL optional, with
developers having to specify whether they wanted to include them or not.)
Finally, changing the MPL would have required re-submitting it to the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>
for certification in connection with the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html">Open Source
Definition</a>, another potentially time-consuming process.</p>

<p>We therefore concluded that a better approach would simply be to use
a triple license. This is a natural extension of the dual license
approach that has previously been used with Mozilla code
and is also being used by other projects, without apparent problems; it
involves the use of licenses (the MPL version 1.1, the NPL version 1.1,
the GPL version 2, and the LGPL version
2.1) that are already familar to open source and free software
developers, avoiding the need to introduce yet another new and different
license.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="why-not-mit">Why didn't you just
relicense the Mozilla code under a non-copyleft license (like the MIT
or BSD licenses) that would be compatible with all other possible
licenses?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>Because historically Mozilla code has always been released under
some form of copyleft licensing, and we wish to continue to use copyleft
provisions to promote sharing of modifications to Mozilla code.</p>

<p>One of the motivations behind the original creation of the NPL and
MPL was to promote sharing of modifications amongst all parties using
Mozilla code. Using the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html">BSD
license</a>, the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT
license</a>,
or similar non-copyleft licenses was considered at that time, and
ultimately rejected in favor of the NPL/MPL copyleft mechanisms; to
quote from the original
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/FAQ.html#12">Netscape Public
License FAQ</a>,</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/FAQ.html#12">
<p>The BSD license, in Netscape's opinion, does not go far enough to
ensure that developers will return their modifications to the
Communicator source code to the community. The company feels that this
is important to ensure long term viability of the source development
effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We believe that this goal is still worth promoting. Thus we have
decided to retain the use of copyleft provisions; of the three license
options available for Mozilla code under the new MPL/GPL/LGPL (or
NPL/GPL/LGPL) triple license, all have copyleft features (of varying
strength) that require modifications to Mozilla code to be
distributed when distributing products using that code.</p>

</div>
</div>


<h2>Implications for Developers</h2>

<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="mozilla-with-proprietary">How will the
new Mozilla license scheme affect developers who want to use Mozilla code
in creating and distributing proprietary applications?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>Not at all; developers creating and distributing proprietary software
incorporating Mozilla code will be able to continue to use that code under
MPL or NPL terms and conditions, exactly as they have been doing all along.</p>

<p>The MPL (as well as the NPL) was originally designed to allow source
files distributed under MPL terms to be combined with source files under
other licenses, and the resulting work to be distributed under a non-MPL
(or non-NPL) license. (This right is contingent on the requirements of
the MPL or NPL being fulfilled. For example, when distributing the resulting
work to users, the distributor must also make available to users the source
code for that portion of the code created from the source files
distributed under the MPL or NPL.)</p>

<p>This feature of the MPL and NPL has allowed developers to distribute
proprietary products
incorporating Mozilla code. (Netscape 6 is one example of such a
product.) Under the MPL/GPL/LGPL (or NPL/GPL/LGPL) triple license scheme developers
may continue to create and distribute Mozilla-based proprietary products,
by taking advantage of the option to use the Mozilla code under the MPL (or
NPL) terms and complying with the various requirements of the MPL (or NPL)
for those portions of the proprietary products based on Mozilla code.</p>

<p>(In theory developers could also distribute Mozilla-based proprietary
products using the Mozilla code under LGPL terms, if the Mozilla code
were in the form of a library and the developers complied with
the relevant requirements of the LGPL.)</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="mozilla-with-lgpl">How will the new
Mozilla licensing scheme affect developers who want to use Mozilla code
to create software distributed under the LGPL?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>If and when the new licensing scheme is fully implemented, developers creating
libraries and related software distributed under the LGPL will be able to
use any Mozilla code in that software under LGPL terms and conditions.</p>

<p>If and when all Mozilla source files are relicensed under the
MPL/GPL/LGPL (or NPL/GPL/LGPL) triple license (or other compatible
licenses), then developers
may create and distribute Mozilla-based libraries and related software
under the LGPL by taking advantage of the option to use the Mozilla
source files under LGPL terms, and complying with the various requirements
of the LGPL for those portions of the software based on code from the
Mozilla source files.</p>

<p>Under the MPL/GPL/LGPL (or NPL/GPL/LGPL) triple license developers may
also extract portions
of Mozilla code and use them in existing source files already under the
LGPL, without needing to change the existing LGPL license notice in those
source files. (This
is possible because the triple license boilerplate language permits deleting
the MPL or NPL portion of the notice and using just an LGPL notice.)</p>

<p>Note that even before all Mozilla source files are relicensed under
the MPL/GPL/LGPL (or NPL/GPL/LGPL) triple license, developers distributing libraries
under the LGPL may use any Mozilla source files already relicensed under the
MPL/GPL/LGPL (or NPL/GPL/LGPL) triple license.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class=faq-item>
<div class=faq-question><a name="mozilla-with-gpl">How will the new
Mozilla licensing scheme affect developers who want to use Mozilla code
to create software distributed under the GPL?</a></div>

<div class=faq-answer>
<p>If and when the new licensing scheme is fully implemented, developers
creating software distributed under the GPL will be able to use any Mozilla
code in that software under GPL terms and conditions.</p>

<p>If and when all Mozilla source files are relicensed under the
MPL/GPL/LGPL (or NPL/GPL/LGPL) triple license (or other compatible
licenses), then developers
may create and distribute Mozilla-based software under the GPL
by taking advantage of the option to use the Mozilla source files under
GPL terms. This allows developers to distribute the entire work under GPL
terms and at the same time comply with the GPL requirements for those
portions of the software based on code from the Mozilla source files.</p>

<p>Under the MPL/GPL/LGPL (or NPL/GPL/LGPL) triple license developers may
also extract portions
of Mozilla code and use them in existing source files already under the
GPL, without needing to change the existing GPL license notice in those
source files. (This
is possible because the triple license boilerplate language permits deleting
the MPL or NPL portion of the notice and substituting the notice
associated with
the GPL.)</p>

<p>Note that if you wish to distribute portions of the Mozilla code
under GPL terms you may be able to do so before the entire
relicensing project has been completed. Since the relicensing will occur
in stages, be sure to check the licenses for the particular files you
want to use, as those files may have already been relicensed under an
MPL/GPL/LGPL (or NPL/GPL/LGPL) triple license, or under the MPL/GPL
or NPL/GPL dual licenses used in the past. </p>
