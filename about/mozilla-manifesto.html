<h1>The Mozilla Manifesto, v0.9</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Internet is becoming an increasingly important part of our
lives.</p>

<p>The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe
that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued
health of the Internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure
that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are
best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser.</p>

<p>The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create
world-class open source software and to develop new types of
collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in
making the Internet experience better for all of us.</p>

<p>As a result of these efforts, we have distilled a set of principles
that we believe are critical for the Internet to continue to benefit
the public good as well as commercial aspects of life. We set out
these principles below.</p>

<p>The goals for the Manifesto are to:</p>

<ol>
<li>articulate a vision for the Internet that Mozilla participants
want the Mozilla Foundation to pursue;
<li>speak to people whether or not they have a technical
background;</li>
<li>make Mozilla contributors proud of what we're doing and motivate
us to continue; and</li>
<li>provide a framework for other people to advance this vision of the
Internet.</li>
</ol>

<p>These principles will not come to life on their own. People are
needed to make the Internet open and participatory - people acting as
individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The
Mozilla Foundation is committed to advancing the principles set out in
the Mozilla Manifesto. We invite others to join us and make the
Internet an ever better place for everyone.</p>

<h2>Principles</h2>

<ol>
<li>The Internet is an integral part of modern life&ndash;a key component
in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment
and society as a whole.</li>

<li>The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and
accessible.</li>

<li>The Internet should enrich the lives of individual human
beings.</li>

<li>Individuals' security on the Internet is fundamental and cannot be
treated as optional.</li>

<li>Individuals must have the ability to shape their own experiences
on the Internet.</li>

<li>The effectiveness of the Internet as a public resource depends
upon interoperability (protocols, data formats, content), innovation
and decentralized participation worldwide.</li>

<li>Free and open source software promotes the development of the
Internet as a public resource.</li>

<li>Transparent community-based processes promote participation,
accountability, and trust.</li>

<li>Commercial involvement in the development of the Internet brings
many benefits; a balance between commercial goals and public benefit
is critical.</li>

<li>Magnifying the public benefit aspects of the Internet is an
important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Advancing the Mozilla Manifesto</h2>

<p>There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the
Mozilla Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and
anticipate the same creativity that Mozilla participants have shown in
other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the
Mozilla project, one basic and very effective way to support the
Manifesto is to use Mozilla Firefox and other products that embody the
principles of the Manifesto.</p>

<h3>Mozilla Foundation Pledge</h3>

<p>The Mozilla Foundation pledges to support the Mozilla Manifesto in
its activities. Specifically, we will:</p>

<ul>
<li>build and enable open-source technologies and communities that
support the Manifesto's principles;</li>
<li>build and deliver great consumer products that support the
Manifesto's principles;</li>
<li>use the Mozilla assets (intellectual property such as copyrights
and trademarks, infrastructure, funds, and reputation) to keep the
Internet an open platform;</li>
<li>promote models for creating economic value for the public benefit;
and</li>
<li>promote the Mozilla Manifesto principles in public discourse and
within the Internet industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some Foundation activities&ndash;currently the creation, delivery
and promotion of consumer products&ndash;are conducted primarily
through the Mozilla Foundation's wholly owned subsidiary, the Mozilla
Corporation.</p>

<h3>Invitation</h3>

<p>The Mozilla Foundation invites all others who support the
principles of the Mozilla Manifesto to join with us, and to find new
ways to make this vision of the Internet a reality.</p>
