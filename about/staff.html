<h1>mozilla.org Staff</h1>

<p>The fundamental requirement of each staff member is that he or she care 
  about the Mozilla project as a whole, separate from an interest in a particular 
  Mozilla-based product. Staff members work for different companies and 
  represent different interests, but we share the common task of making 
  the organization and project infrastructure work well so that everyone 
  (ourselves included) can focus on making the code work better. Many but 
  not all of us are paid by our respective employers to work on mozilla.org 
  activities.</p>
<p>Staff members deal with a broad range of issues, primarily those that 
  affect the entire project. For issues whose scope is less broad, staff 
  tries to delegate authority to community members who have expertise with 
  a particular area, as we have done with <a href="drivers">drivers</a> 
  and <a href="../hacking/module-ownership.html">module owners</a>. 
  Issues that affect the entire project include such things as the roadmap 
  and milestone planning, code review processes, 
  handling of security-related bugs, reorganization of the Mozilla website 
  (where we are way behind), etc.</p>
<p>Not every staff member participates equally in every issue. We don't 
  have a formal committee system within staff, but staff members with expertise 
  and interest in an area will take the lead in those areas. Nevertheless, 
  all staff members pay particular attention to the management of the source 
  tree and our instance of Bugzilla. These are our primary assets, and we 
  all participate in its management when issues arise.</p>
<p>Since mozilla.org is a virtual organization, there is no formal employment 
  or authority relationship among the staff. Nevertheless, we operate with 
  a certain sense of order, shared responsibility, consensus building, and 
  trust. We seek a general consensus among staff, and we expect a sense 
  of give and take. We expect staff members to state their view forcefully, 
  but to recognize that even passionately held views will not always be 
  adopted by the group. When consensus is difficult or an individual decision-maker 
  is needed, we look to Brendan Eich for technical matters, and Mitchell 
  Baker for policy and organizational matters. It would be hard to imagine 
  staff taking technical actions to which Brendan is adamantly opposed, 
  or policy actions to which Mitchell is adamantly opposed. It's possible 
  of course, and critical that the possibility remain. We lead because people 
  trust us, are supportive of our mission, and are willing to follow, not 
  because we have some unalienable right to the position.</p>
<p>Staff members need to be clear when they are expressing their views as 
  a contributor to the Mozilla project, and when they are speaking for mozilla.org. 
  And we expect staff members to speak for mozilla.org only after a decision 
  has been reached.</p>

<p>Here is a list of current staff members. We have not determined whether 
  there is an ideal size for staff. Too big and the group is unwieldy and 
  becomes a bottleneck; too small and we can't do what is needed and again 
  become a bottleneck. We expect that future staff members will have participated 
  in the project in a variety of capacities and will have the ability to 
  separate their desires from that of the project, and make decisions accordingly. 
  We anticipate that future staff members will have been Staff Associate 
  members and probably a Module Owner or Activity Owner as well before being 
  asked to joing mozilla.org staff.</p>

<h2 id="members">mozilla.org Staff Members</h2>

<p>If you have a project management issue, you can email the entire staff via 
<a href="mailto:staff&#64;mozilla.org">staff&#64;mozilla.org</a>.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Mitchell Baker, Chief Lizard Wrangler (<a href="mailto:mitchell@mozilla.org">mitchell@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd> 
  <p>Mitchell is the general troubleshooter, spokesperson and policy arbitrator 
   for mozilla.org. She works extensively with companies and projects using 
   Mozilla. This involves explaining mozilla.org processes, listening to the 
   needs of contributors, and seeking to integrate open source development 
   techniques with the world of commercial software development.
  <p>Mitchell also spends a lot of time driving consensus as to how mozilla.org 
   ought to manage the project, which suggests she may have a masochistic streak. 
   She dreams of making the Mozilla project easier to understand.
  <p>Before joining mozilla.org staff, Mitchell was the attorney at Netscape 
   responsible for all legal issues related to product development and intellectual 
   property protection. During that time she wrote the Netscape and Mozilla 
   Public Licenses.
 <dt><a href="http://people.redhat.com/blizzard/">Chris Blizzard</a>
  (<a href="mailto:blizzard@mozilla.org">blizzard@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd> 
  <p>Chris hacks on various parts of Mozilla. The straight Xlib port of Mozilla 
   is mostly his fault. He also hacks on the gtk port when it really needs 
   help and people ask really nicely. He dreams of things like adding WebDAV 
   support and other fun network features. He also dreams about the directions 
   the mozilla project could take and what it can accomplish.
  <p>Chris has been using Linux and open software since the 0.99 days. Starting 
   as a user he self taught himself programming and now hacks on various projects 
   when he has time. He's been working with Mozilla code since the source was 
   released. In the past he's played roles as a sysadmin, web jockey, database 
   programmer and project manager.
 <dt>Asa Dotzler
  (<a href="mailto:asa@mozilla.org">asa@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd>
  <p>Asa is our community quality advocate extraordinaire. He joined mozilla.org 
   to turbo-charge our quality programs and to further develop our volunteer 
   <abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr> and testing community. When he's 
   not helping new contributors test Mozilla and report bugs he's working with 
   <a href="drivers">drivers@mozilla.org</a> to define 
   requirements for and ship Mozilla milestones.
 <dt>Brendan Eich
  (<a href="mailto:brendan@mozilla.org">brendan@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd>
  <p>Brendan is responsible for architecture and the technical direction of 
   Mozilla. He is charged with authorizing module owners, owning architectural 
   issues of the source base and writing the
   <a href="../roadmap.html">roadmap</a> that outlines the direction of the 
   Mozilla project.
  <p>Brendan created <a href="../js/">JavaScript</a>, did the work through Navigator 
   4.0, and helped carry it through international standardization. Before Netscape, 
   he wrote operating system and network code for SGI; and at MicroUnity, wrote 
   micro-kernel and DSP code, and did the first MIPS R4K port of gcc, the GNU 
   C compiler.
 <dt><a href="http://www.gerv.net/">Gervase Markham</a>
  (<a href="mailto:gerv@mozilla.org">gerv@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd> 
  <p>Gerv works part-time for the Mozilla Foundation, and is the only staff member based 
   outside the continental USA. He is responsible for the relicensing project 
   and trademarks, has a strong interest in security and usability,
   and does most of his hacking (when he has time) on 
   <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org">Bugzilla</a>. His blog is
   <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/">Hacking for Christ</a>.
   
 <dt>Myk Melez
  (<a href="mailto:myk@mozilla.org">myk@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd> 
  <p>Myk is a toolsmith and sometimes document writer. Besides hacking on Bugzilla 
   and occasionally coaxing it back to life when the world gets to be too much 
   for it, he stands ready to write new tools (like
   <a href="http://doctor.mozilla.org/">Doctor</a>) as the need arises. He tries 
   his best to balance daily work with grand visions for the future.
  <p>Before mozilla.org, Myk wrote <a href="http://forumzilla.mozdev.org/">ForumZilla</a>,
   before which he worked at <abbr title="University of California">UC</abbr> Santa Cruz
   as a Web applications 
   developer, before which he spent copious amounts of time, money, and energy 
   getting a degree in the practical field of Sociology, before which he taught 
   himself programming (apparently a common theme around these parts) on his 
   sporty 0.3Mhz Apple IIe in order to hack keyboard support into video games.

<h1 id="associates">Mozilla.org Staff Associates</h1>

<div class="para">
  <p>Staff Associate is an experimental position we created in the fall of 2001. 
    The role is for a person who 
  <ul>
    <li>Has demonstrated experience and/or aptitude for addressing the types 
      of issues that come to staff attention. These issues tend to be balancing 
      of perspectives, communication and problem resolution, and fitting together 
      differing needs. These are quite different from being a primo hacker, 
      and require a different set of interests. Often the two do not overlap. 
    </li>
    <li>Has been involved in Mozilla in a range of activities (i.e., code 
      contributions are precious, but alone would be unlikely to make an Associate 
      position make sense) </li>
    <li>Has demonstrated to staff an ability to work in our consensus based 
      organizational style.</li>
    <li>Fills a hole in the expertise/resources of staff members.</li>
    <li>Is interested in the direction of Mozilla technology and in the Mozilla 
      project in general, separate from an interest in any particular product</li>
    <li>can make decisions for the benefit of the entire community, both by 
      temperament and because his or her employer (if any) permits this</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>An Associate supports mozilla.org staff by providing input into staff discussions 
  and decision-making process. An Associate may also investigate issues and 
  provide background materials to staff. An Associate does not speak for mozilla.org, 
  and does not have an &quot;@mozilla.org&quot; email address.</p>
<p>The Associate role might be a step in joining mozilla.org staff, or it 
  might show that the Associate and staff members don't work that well together. 
  We may also use this role for staff members who no longer have enough 
  time available to remain staff members but whose input we seek whenever 
  we can get it.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Peter Bojanic
  (<a href="mailto:peter@bojanic.ca">peter@bojanic.ca</a>)
 <dd> 
  <p>Peter is an engineering type with that elusive combination of development 
   experience and business acumen. He promotes Mozilla technology and translates 
   tech talk to execs then reads their minds and explains the business speak 
   to engineers. Peter works for <a href="http://www.oeone.com/">OEone Corporation</a> 
   which is developing the Penzilla operating environment based on Linux and 
   Mozilla. He's their <abbr title="Vice President">VP</abbr> Software Development 
   and resident Jedi.
 <dt><a href="http://ScottCollins.net/">Scott Collins</a>
  (<a href="mailto:scc@mozilla.org">scc@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd> 
  <p>Scott is a core engineer, technical evangelist and liaison for the Mozilla project.
   You may already be familiar with Scott's work on
   <a href="../projects/xpcom"><abbr title="Cross-Platform Component Object Model">XPCOM</abbr></a>,
   <a href="../projects/xpcom/nsCOMPtr.html">nsCOMPtr</a>, 
   Mozilla's <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/string/">Strings</a>,
   or from his technical lectures (e.g., on
   C++ portability [<a href="./../hacking/cpp_portability/">slides</a>, <a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/presentations/cpp-portability.rm">video</a>]
   Mozilla Strings [<a href="./../projects/xpcom/string-talk/">slides</a>,
   <a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/presentations/strings.rm">video</a>],
   XPCOM [<a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/brownbag/volume2.rm">video</a>],
   or at campuses, conferences, and users' group meetings across the US).
   If you want to hack on Mozilla and don't know where to start or how to get involved,
   or if you're looking for someone to speak to your group about
   Mozilla engineering or technical details, Scott is here to help.
 <dt><a href="http://www.hecker.org/">Frank Hecker</a>
  (<a href="mailto:hecker@mozilla.org">hecker@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd> 
  <p>Frank Hecker is mozilla.org's self-appointed policy wonk and amateur document
   editor; among other things, he helped create the
   <a href="../MPL/relicensing-faq.html">Mozilla Relicensing
   <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> document</a>,
   the <a href="../MPL/license-policy.html">mozilla.org License Policy</a>,
   the policy for handling Mozilla security bugs, and the Mozilla Crypto
   <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> document. Frank was one of 
   the people who successfully sold Netscape management on the advantages of 
   releasing source code, and in the spirit of "service after the sale" he 
   has been volunteering with mozilla.org ever since.
 <dt>Marcia Knous (<a href="mailto:marcia@mozilla.org">marcia@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd>
  <p>Marcia can't be easily categorized in any technical sense since she doesn't
   have much of a technical background and often flies low on the radar.
  <p>Her mozilla.org work involves dealing with a lot of administrative minutia,
   including handling all CVS accounts and troubleshooting when things go awry.
   In her pre-Mozilla days, Marcia worked in entertainment and law and still
   dabbles in freelance writing. These days she mostly dreams about treating the
   anxieties of the present with the wisdom of the ages.
 <dt>Dan Mosedale
  (<a href="mailto:dmose@mozilla.org">dmose@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd> 
  <p>Dan has been working on pieces of Mozilla
   (<abbr title="Lightweigh Directory Access Protocol">LDAP</abbr> support,
   <abbr>LDAP</abbr> typedown autocomplete, 
   getting UNIX Quantify to play nice) as well as mozilla.org tools (Bugzilla, 
   Despot, license and statistics scriptage) for a while.
  <p>Before joining mozilla.org, Dan was the systems administrator at Mosaic 
   Communications Corp. From there, he moved on to
   <abbr title="Information Systems">IS</abbr> Architecture work at Netscape, co-wrote 
   the <abbr title="Domain Name Server">DNS</abbr> server used by Netcenter to distribute 
   its Website worldwide, and enhanced and maintained Netscape's mail-to-news 
   gateway code.
 <dt>Mike Shaver
  (<a href="mailto:shaver@mozilla.org">shaver@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd> 
  <p>As a founding member of mozilla.org, Mike has enjoyed a rare opportunity to
     inflict a wide variety of trials and errors on the Mozilla code and project.
     He is stronger for it, and hopes that Mozilla is as well.
  <p>
     Scheming diabolically from his fortress of solitude in Toronto, shaver meddles
     in matters ranging from platform architecture and implementation to licensing and
     organizational development.  If you are short on opinions, he often has some to spare.
 <dt>Seth Spitzer
  (<a href="mailto:sspitzer@mozilla.org">sspitzer@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd>
  <p>Back from <a href="http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvslog.cgi?file=mozilla/js/src/jsfun.c&amp;rev=3.52&amp;mark=3.52">exile</a>, Seth is currently working on <a href="../products/firefox/">Firefox</a>.  Before that, he worked on <a href="../products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> and the <a href="../mailnews/">mailnews</a> part of the <a href="../products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla Suite</a>.

<h1 id="emeritus">Mozilla.org Emeritus Staff</h1>

<dl>
 <dt>Dawn Endico
  (<a href="mailto:endico@mozilla.org">endico@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd> 
  <p>Dawn is a toolsmith and Webmaster. In addition to getting <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/">LXR</a> 
   working on the mozilla source code, Dawn worked to keep the documentation 
   on this site organized and up-to-date.
  <p>In previous lives, Dawn has worked as a Production Artist, exhibited digital 
   artwork, designed commercial Web sites, and worked as a system administrator.
 <dt>Daniel (Leaf) Nunes
  (<a href="mailto:leaf@mozilla.org">leaf@mozilla.org</a>)
 <dd> 
  <p>Leaf was mozilla.org's release engineer and build-issue spear catcher for
   many years. He spent a lot of time worrying about piddly little details, like
   whether or not the Mozilla source can be compiled into something runnable. This 
   means he worked on details like the build systems and getting the source 
   and test executables to developers.
  <p>Leaf is a veteran of <abbr title="University of California">UC</abbr> Santa
   Cruz and Fabrik, and his sense of humour and compassion is greatly appreciated
   by everyone who received a 3AM "so you broke the tree" wake-up call.
<dt>David Hyatt
