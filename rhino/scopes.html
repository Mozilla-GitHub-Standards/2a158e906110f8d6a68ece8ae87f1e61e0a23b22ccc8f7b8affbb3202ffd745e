<script type="text/javascript" src="owner.js"></script>  

<p class="crumbs"><em>You are here:</em> <a href="./">Rhino project page</a> &gt; <strong>Scopes and Contexts</strong></p>

<h1>Scopes and Contexts</h1>
 
<script type="text/javascript">document.write(owner());</script>

<p>Before using Rhino in a concurrent environment, it is important to 
understand the distinction between Contexts and scopes. Both are 
required to execute scripts, but they play different roles. Simple 
embeddings of Rhino probably won't need any of the information here, 
but more complicated embeddings can gain performance and flexibility 
from the techniques described below.</p>

<h2><a name="contexts" id="contexts">Contexts</a></h2>

<p>The Rhino Context object is used to store thread-specific information 
about the execution environment. There should be one and only one 
Context associated with each thread that will be executing JavaScript.</p>

<p>To associate the current thread with a Context, simply call the 
<code>enter</code> method of Context:</p>

<pre class="code">
    Context cx = Context.enter();
</pre>

<p>Once you are done with execution, simply exit the Context:</p>

<pre class="code">
    Context.exit();
</pre>

<p>These calls will work properly even if there is already a Context 
associated with the current thread. That context will be returned 
and an internal counter incremented. Only when the counter reaches 
zero will it be disassociated from the thread.</p>

<p>Remember to put the <code>exit()</code> call in a <code>finally</code> 
block if you're executing code that could throw an exception.</p>

<h2><a name="scopes" id="scopes">Scopes</a></h2>

<p>A scope is a set of JavaScript objects. Execution of scripts 
requires a scope for top-level script variable storage as well as 
a place to find standard objects like <code>Function</code> and 
<code>Object</code>.</p>

<p>It's important to understand that a scope is independent of the 
Context that created it. You can create a scope using one Context 
and then evaluate a script using that scope and another Context 
(either by exiting the current context and entering another, or by 
executing on a different thread). You can even execute scripts on 
multiple threads simultaneously in the same scope. Rhino guarantees 
that accesses to properties of JavaScript objects are atomic across 
threads, but doesn't make any more guarantees for scripts executing
in the same scope at the same time. If two scripts use the same scope 
simultaneously, the scripts are responsible for coordinating any 
accesses to shared variables.</p>

<p>A top-level scope is created by calling 
<code>Context.initStandardObjects</code> to create all the standard 
objects:</p>

<pre class="code">
    ScriptableObject scope = cx.initStandardObjects();
</pre>

<p>The easiest way to embed Rhino is just to create a new scope this 
way whenever you need one. However, <code>initStandardObjects</code> 
is an expensive method to call and it allocates a fair amount of memory. 
We'll see below that there are ways to share a scope created this way 
among multiple scopes and threads.</p>

<h2><a name="namelookup" id="namelookup">Name Lookup</a></h2>

<p>So how are scopes used to look up names? In general, variables 
are looked up by starting at the current variable object (which 
is different depending on what code is being executed in the 
program), traversing its prototype chain, and then traversing the 
parent chain. In the diagram below, the order in which the six 
objects are traversed is indicated.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center;">
<img src="lookup.gif" height="194" width="500" alt=""><br>
<i>Order of lookups in a two-deep scope chain with prototypes.</i></div>
  
<p>For a more concrete example, let's consider the following script:</p>

<pre class="code">
  var g = 7;
  function f(a) {
      var v = 8;
      x = v + a;
  }
  f(6);
</pre>

<p>We have a top-level variable <code>g</code>, and the call to 
<code>f</code> will create a new top-level variable <code>x</code>. 
All top-level variables are properties of the scope object. When 
we start executing <code>f</code>, the scope chain will start with 
the function's activation object and will end with the top-level
scope (see diagram below). The activation object has two 
properties, 'a' for the argument, and 'v' for the variable. The 
top-level scope has properties for the variable <code>g</code> 
and the function <code>f</code>.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center;">
<img src="scopes.gif" height="496" width="820" alt=""><br>
<i>An example scope chain for a simple script.</i></div>
  
<p>When the statement <code>x = v + a;</code> is executed, the 
scope chain is traversed looking for a 'x' property. When none 
is found, a new property 'x' is created in the top-level scope.</p>

<h2><a name="sharingscopes" id="sharingscopes">Sharing Scopes</a></h2>

<p>JavaScript is a language that uses delegation rather than 
traditional class-based inheritance. This is a large topic in 
itself, but for our purposes it gives us an easy way to share 
a set of read-only variables across multiple scopes.</p> 
 
<p>To do this we set an object's prototype. When accessing a 
property of an object in JavaScript, the object is first searched 
for a property with the given name. If none is found, the object's 
prototype is searched. This continues until either the object is 
found or the end of the prototype chain is reached.</p>

<p>So to share information across multiple scopes, we first 
create the object we wish to share. Typically this object will 
have been created with <code>initStandardObjects</code> and may 
also have additional objects specific to the embedding. Then all
we need to do is create a new object and call its 
<code>setPrototype</code> method to set the prototype to the 
shared object, and the parent of the new scope to null:</p>

<pre class="code">
    Scriptable newScope = cx.newObject(sharedScope);
    newScope.setPrototype(sharedScope);
    newScope.setParentScope(null);
</pre>

<p>The call to <code>newObject</code> simply creates a new 
JavaScript object with no properties. It uses the 
<code>sharedScope</code> passed in to initialize the
prototype with the standard <code>Object.prototype</code> value.</p> 

<p>We can now use <code>newScope</code> as a scope for calls to 
evaluate scripts. Let's call this scope the <i>instance scope</i>. 
Any top-level functions or variables defined 
in the script will end up as properties of the instance scope. Uses 
of standard objects like <code>Function</code>, <code>String</code>, 
or <code>RegExp</code> will find the definitions in the shared 
scope. Multiple instance scopes can be defined and have their own 
variables for scripts yet share the definitions in the shared scope. 
These multiple instance scopes can be used concurrently.</p>

<h2><a name="sealedshared" id="sealedshared">Sealed shared scopes</a></h2>

<p>The ECMAScript standard defines that scripts can add properties 
to all standard library objects and in many cases it is also possible 
to change or delete their properties as well. Such behavior may not 
be suitable with shared scopes since if a script by mistake adds a 
property to a library object from the shared scope, that object 
would not be garbage collected until there are active references to 
the shared scope potentially leading to memory leaks. In addition 
if a script alters some of the standard objects, the library may 
not work properly for other scripts. Such bugs are hard to debug 
and to remove a possibility for them to occur one can seal the 
shared scope and all its objects.</p>

<p>A notion of a sealed object is a JavaScript extension supported 
by Rhino and it means that properties can not be added/deleted to 
the object and the existing object properties can not be changed. 
Any attempt to modify sealed object throws an exception. To seal 
all objects in the standard library pass <code>true</code> for 
the sealed argument when calling 
<code>Context.initStandardObjects(ScriptableObject, boolean)</code>:</p>

<pre>
    ScriptableObject sealedSharedScope = cx.initStandardObjects(null, true);
</pre>  

<p>This seals only all standard library objects, it does not seal 
the shared scope itself thus after calling 
<code>initStandardObjects</code>, <code>sealedSharedScope</code> 
can be farther populated with application-specific objects and 
functions. Then after a custom initialization is done, one can 
seal the shared scope by calling 
<code>ScriptableObject.sealObject()</code>:</p>

<pre>
    sealedSharedScope.sealObject();
</pre>  

<p>Note that currently one needs to explicitly seal any 
additional properties he adds to the sealed shared scope since 
although after calling <code>sealedSharedScope.sealObject();</code> 
it would no be possible to set the additional properties to 
different values, one still would be able to alter the objects 
themselves.</p>

<h2><a name="dynamic" id="dynamic">Dynamic Scopes</a></h2>

<p>There's one problem with the setup outlined above. Calls to 
functions in JavaScript use <i>static scope</i>, which means that 
variables are first looked up in the function and then, if not 
found there, in the lexically enclosing scope. This causes 
problems if functions you define in your shared scope need access 
to variables you define in your instance scope.</p>

<p>With Rhino 1.6, it is possible to use <i>dynamic scope</i>. 
With dynamic scope, functions look at the top-level scope of 
the currently executed script rather than their lexical 
scope. So we can store information that varies across scopes 
in the instance scope yet still share functions that 
manipulate that information reside in the shared scope.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/js/rhino/examples/DynamicScopes.java">
DynamicScopes example</a> illustrates all the points discussed above.</p>

<h2>More on Scopes</h2>

<p>The key things to determine in setting up scopes for 
your application are</p> 

<ol>
  <li>What scope should global variables be created in when your 
script executes an assignment to an undefined variable, and</li>
  <li>What variables should your script have access to when it 
references a variable?</li>
</ol>

<p>The answer to 1 determines which scope should be the ultimate 
parent scope: Rhino follows the parent chain up to the top and 
places the variable there. After you've constructed your parent 
scope chain, the answer to question 2 may indicate that 
there are additional scopes that need to be searched that are 
not in your parent scope chain. You can add these as prototypes
of scopes in your parent scope chain. When Rhino looks up a 
variable, it starts in the current scope, walks the prototype 
chain, then goes to the parent scope and its prototype chain, 
until there are no more parent scopes left.</p>
