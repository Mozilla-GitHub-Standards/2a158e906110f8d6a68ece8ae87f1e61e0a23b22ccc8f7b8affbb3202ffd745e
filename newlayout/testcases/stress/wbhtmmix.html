forgotten. Everything's mixed - fiction, nonfiction, biography, history,
all hodgepodge. Give me credit for including the embarassing stuff.

<P>This page gets frequent small updates, but it's long - I have to figure
out a way to shorten it - maybe put the reviews behind links? If you have
ideas, <A HREF="mailto:paquin@netscape.com?subject=better book page organization">send

<TD>This is a very funny book. It's short, maybe a 2-hour read. The author's
style of humor is a major factor, as is the inventiveness of some of the
absurdity.&nbsp;

<P>Many friends of mine also liked it a lot. However, I have met those
who simply don't get it. I think you can tell in one chapter if you will
hate it. Adams has a lot to say and he gets a lot of it into this book.
It's mostly comedy laced with social commentary in a scifi setting; I don't
care much for scifi as a class, but I liked this a lot.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD COLSPAN="2">These books are pretty similar in description. They're
about some well-raised young women (and their families and friends, of
course) in early 19th-century England, trying to get married and juggle
men and propriety and manners and such. They're full of dialogue and personal
interactions, and are wonderful period pieces. Austen writes extremely
well, but the matters at hand are consistent and can get tedious if you're
not really into the manners of the day. There's tons of stuff about Austen

<TD>Just after WWII, an apparently well-funded American couple and an acquaintance
zip off to North Africa to travel around for an indefinite period. Via
their encounters with the comparatively primitive (but most importantly
<I>foreign</I>) culture, conditions, and accomodations, we are exposed
to their thoughts, emotions, and psyches. We are shown that realities are
just views, that our hold on these realities may be quite tenuous, and
that we never really know. I suspect this is a book which will mean very
different things to different people.&nbsp;

and clergy which ruled the continent. But wait, Ireland was moving the
other way - from barbarism to civilization, thanks to Patrick and others.
Records and other forms of knowledge were saved from oblivion by the Irish'
comparatively tolerant thirst for knowledge, literature, whatever, and
their tireless copying and development of anything they could find from

<TD>Chekhov's short stories are magnificent. They're usually about ordinary
people in almost ordinary situations, but he extracts the essence of some
aspect of human nature and suddenly ordinariness is fascinating. He knows
people, he takes you to times and places, and he writes simply and effortlessley.
Contrary to popular belief, he is often funny. I was once reading Chekhov
while eating alone in a pub in Winchester when I busted up laughing. The
pub guy clearly thought I was one strange American to be laughing out loud
at dreary serious dull Russian literature. Well, maybe I am strange.&nbsp;

show us how brilliant Holmes is. They're pretty much the same. Read one

<TR>
<TD>Dexter is famous for a series of mystery detective novels which take
place in modern Oxford. Chief Inspector Morse is middle aged, drinks a
lot, has as many vices as virtues, is revered by most and always gets his
man. Smarter than Mycroft, etc. The stories are OK, but the writing is
too contrived, too patently revealing clues on a schedule, and too stilted.
Also, Dexter gets downright insulting as he brags about his ability to
spell correctly, to use proper grammar, and to quote accurately. There
is the thinnest of veils covering his sneers in which (for example) he
dares the reader to catch the three misspellings in the victim's note.
You're expected to be impressed, I guess, by an author who knows the difference
between their, they're, and there.&nbsp;

<P>And that's not all. Another disappointment is the awkward presentation
of Oxford, its environs, and its people. Dexter's opinion of detail is
apparently to describe the plaque on the side of some actual door, or to
explain in detail which street intersects with which. He completely misses
conveying the sense that you've been there. Furthermore Dexter overdoes
it when establishing Morse's rare and admirable qualities. It's as if he
thinks that he can boast more if he only remembers to point out weaknesses
as well. Enough, enough, enough.&nbsp;

<P>I read two or three of these in situations when anything would do for
a read. They were so well recommended. Well, I'll save the rest for another
hard up moment.&nbsp;</TD>

<TR>
<TD>Until <A HREF="#OBrian">Patrick O'Brian</A> came about, Forester's
Hornblower was the nonpareil of historical fiction covering the Royal Navy
in the Napoleonic era. Forester's Hornblower was so good, and the field
so rich (even when based on actual events), that others wanted to write
similar stuff. But they had terrible shoes to fill; all but O'Brian are
well back in the pack. You don't have to be militaristic or an Anglophile
(I'm neither) to be fascinated by the stuff the Royal Navy would go through
to get things done back then.&nbsp;</TD>

<P>As far as the linguistic showboating is concerned, I think we have some
unintentional hypocrisy on Fry's part. He bemoans our current inability
to make even tolerable use of our language, then goes on to overexercise
a rather esoteric vocabulary. I share his unhappiness over the widespread
poor use of language in writing as well as discourse, but I think better-chosen
ordinary words are far preferable to the arcana employed in this book.&nbsp;</TD>

<TR>
<TD>This is a memoir of a few years in Karr's childhood mostly in Texas.
She had a pretty rough childhood, with a hard-drinking mother who was a
misplaced would-be cultured cosmopolite and a rough (though loving and,
apparently intelligent) father, and not a lot of money. There's mom getting
sent to the mental hospital and a horrible grandmother and plenty of childhood
terrors familiar and not.&nbsp;

<P>Karr remains upbeat throughout, like a child might, and has a nice attitude
through it all. Some people claim this makes the book "funny" but I couldn't
disagree more. No matter how I slice it, it's a downer. Though very well
written, sometimes lyrical, I just don't think it was worth it. It's like
a picture of an accident. OK, clear enough, but did I have to see that?

<TD>Ludlum wrote a pile of what I call "spy books" even if there's no spy.
The general plot is: Joe Normal gets accidentally swept up into incredibly
fast-paced world of high-stakes international intrigue. People shoot at
him; people leave him strange messages; his past or ancestry suddenly becomes
relevant. He meets the gorgeous rocket scientist woman and they become
a team. Somehow living by wits and outdoing the incredibly resourceful
and well-funded pros, Joe saves the world.&nbsp;

<P>But Ludlum created a style. He writes very fast tense action, often
in one word sentences. Many people claim that Ludlum costs them way too
much sleep - they cannot put the books down. So, go try <I>The Bourne Identity</I>
and if you like it, you'll be in hog heaven for awhile. If you don't, well,

<TR>
<TD>This refers to a bunch of books about a British barrister who's unimpressed
by artificial status or pomp. He likes to defend criminals in the Old Bailey,
and you encounter plenty of that, but the real value of the stories is
Mortimer's acute perception of human nature - the criminals, the other
lawyers, the judges, his wife ("She Who Must Be Obeyed"), and, notably,
himself. The writing itself is good as well. I became convinced that Rumpole
is Mortimer, BTW. The stories are set in the time of writing - late 1980's
more or less.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>An early work of Mortimer's, from the 50s I think. An English couple
encounters some questions and possibly strife in the marriage when a local
tart is found dead. The story is about people's thoughts and relationships
and the impact of social rules or boundaries we maintain in our lives -
it includes a segment where a fellow shows up as asks the wrong questions
and tells the wrong truths and makes people uncomfortable for example -
but doesn't judge them very much. I wouldn't recommend this as a first
taste of Mortimer.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>A memoir of a Doctor in late 19th to early 20th centuries, this tells

and with a strong sense of morality and conscience. As such, he is quite
politically correct, and the book is from the 1930s. The title refers to
the house he built on Capri. Munthe and his book were quite celebrated
there, even among the barons and duchesses, and San Michele and other Munthe
residue can still be viewed there.&nbsp;

</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Every member of this long (18 so far) series is magnificent; you may
savor every word. The setting is Royal Navy, early 1800s.&nbsp;

<P>O'Brian's prose and dialog are amazing. His characters are diverse,
complete, real, and engaging. They succeed and fail, win and lose. Some
describe O'Brian as a masculine Jane Austen (with a bigger dose of intelligent
humor added) ... these works are incredible period pieces, taking you completely
to a time and place without artifice of any kind. You certainly don't have
to care a whit about naval history to adore these books. On the other hand,
if that's all you are interested in, you won't find anything better.&nbsp;

<P>These books comprise a long tale around two men. One is Jack Aubrey
of the Navy. He's not an atypical Post Captain of 1810. The other is Stephen
Maturin, a Dublin physician of mixed Catalan descent who volunteers as
an agent in order to assist in the overthrow of Bonaparte (Stephen loves
France, hates Napoleon), Stephen signs on as Ship's Surgeon as a way to
see the world (he's an ardent and somewhat known natural philosopher),
and the two form a friendship which yields to O'Brian infinite material.&nbsp;

<P>If you didn't already know it, the things the Royal Navy went through
between, say, 1750 and 1812 are entirely amazing. There's no need to invent
incredible accomplishments, feats, attempts, or situations because the
history provides circumstances which, if not documented, would be beyond
belief. If O'Brian's stories weren't available (with different names) in
contemporary news, letters, etc, we might find his tales pretty well beyond
the limits of credible fiction.&nbsp;

<P>There are other authors who have attempted this kind of work. O'Brian
is by far the best. <A HREF="#Forester">Forester</A> is very good in a
distant second; everyone else is behind in the pack.&nbsp;

<TR>
<TD>Hoo boy. This monster book is the manifesto of the philosophy which
Rand calls "objectivism" and which is hard to summarize, but let's say:
reason and competence should defeat all else. Objectivism's politics are
therefore not too distant from modern Libertarianism. The premise of the
book is that the <I>looters</I> leech off those who are capable and/or
hard-working, and the reason the looters get away with it is because we
let them. Well, we can't let them <I>starve</I> can we? So we feed them.
Thus, to get free food, simply don't buy it yourself. Meanwhile, government
is all set up to maximize its ability to live off its consituents, etc,
etc. Soooo, what to do? Easy: get the capable and hardworking people to
just quit. Don't bust your butt trying to make their broken system work
- that just gives them more to leech off of. So, one by one, the essential
people who really make the world go round stop playing, and of course,
the world falls to its knees - Atlas shrugs and the whole world shakes.&nbsp;

<P>There's all sorts of things here which go a bit far, and some extremely
preachy chapters (eg <I>This is John Galt Speaking</I>, and see <A HREF="http://metro.turnpike.net/metro/dcole/business/evil1.html">"So
you think that money is the root of all evil?"</A> ), but I think this
is a worthwhile read. Even if you disagree with some or all of Rand's conclusions,
there's some good stuff here and at least you'll get insight into the other
side. I think this is really good for people in their early 20s.&nbsp;

<TD>One of the all-time great Chinese classics, this is like Chinese Shakespeare.
You have two very wealthy and powerful families living in splendor in the
capital. They appear to have it all in a very sophisticated and rich culture.
No struggles for survival here - the daily grind is manners, style, subtle
inclinations, peaks of ecstasy and oceans of tears over incomprehensibly
irrelevant minutae - the struggles of the very rich.&nbsp;

<P>The story involves tons of Chinese period detail which is nice. You
see again that times and places are different, but people aren't, via star-crossed
lovers, family politics, successes and failures, hopes realized and dashed,
and lots of dialog and personal interactions. In short, there are about
a dozen tear-jerker movies in here.&nbsp;

<P>This story is very long. (Penguin does this in five paperback volumes.)
You can do very well to get an abridgement. This will give you the story
and more than enough detail. Remember that, as Shakespeare's characters
come primarily from the most upper classes, so do these, and you get the
same sort of limited view. But so what.&nbsp;</TD>
