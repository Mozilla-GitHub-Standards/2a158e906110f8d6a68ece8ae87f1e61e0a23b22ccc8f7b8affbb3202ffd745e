<P>This paragraph should be backed in yellow, and, using the STYLE attribute, the last word should also have an yellow <SPAN STYLE="color: transparent">background</SPAN>.</P>
<P>This sentence should be backed in yellow, and, using the CLASS attribute,the last word in this sentence should also have a yellow <SPAN class="two">background</SPAN>.  This is because the background color of the parent element (the paragraph) should "shine through" the SPANned word "background," which was set to <CODE>transparent</CODE>.  If the document background is visible through the SPANned word, the browser is in error.</P>

<P class="two">This paragraph should allow the document background to "shine through."  No yellow backgrounds here!</P>
