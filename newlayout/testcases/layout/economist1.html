Unsurprisingly, Iraq and
the UN Security Council are
once again on collision course.
Richard Butler, the head of the
UN team pursuing evidence of
Iraq’s past or present
possession of particularly lethal
weapons, this week cut short
his talks with Tariq Aziz, Iraq’s
deputy prime minister, saying
that his latest inspection
programme had been rejected.
The Iraqis, for their part, have
declared that they are
suspending co-operation. On
August 6th they failed to
provide escorts for a team of
inspectors (though UN monitors,
who look to the future rather
than the past, were provided
for). 
</p>

<p>
Iraq argues that seven years of inspections are enough: it need do no
              more to prove that it has got rid of its weapons of mass destruction, and
              should therefore be allowed to sell its oil again. In the meantime, it says, it
              will renew co-operation only if the UN inspection commission is radically
              reformed to free it from American influence. 
</p><p>
              Deadlock. Six months ago, when a formidable American armada,
              supported by Britain, was preparing to bomb and shell a defiant Iraq, Kofi
              Annan, the UN’s secretary-general, defused the immediate crisis. But,
              given the depth of distrust on both sides, no agreement was likely to last. 
</p><p>
              The UN teams have destroyed an arsenal of Iraqi weapons and
              weapon-making material, and ploughed through forests of documents, but
              Iraqi lies and evasions convince them that more nasty things, particularly
              of the biological sort, lie hidden away. As he returned from Baghdad this
              week, Mr Butler said that he was close to giving Iraq a clean bill of health
              on missiles and chemical weapons, but was still far from that point in the
              biological field. Iraq claims that the Security Council, driven by America,
              is determined to drag the inspection process on indefinitely, or at least for
              as long as Saddam Hussein is Iraq’s ruler. 
</p><p>
              What will happen if Iraq continues to refuse to co-operate? It could be
              encouraged in its defiance by gathering evidence of world weariness.
              Compulsion becomes progressively harder. The reservations and special
              interests that split the Security Council last time round have not been
              bridged. In the region itself there was little heart for military action
              before, and even less now. Most of Iraq’s neighbours feel that the time
              has come to move on. 
</p><p>
              Iraq is no longer seen as a direct threat, except by Kuwait, and few
              remain insensitive to the suffering that sanctions have brought to ordinary
              Iraqis. The programme for selling oil in exchange for food and medicine
              amounts to no more than "band-aid", says Denis Halliday, who has been
              administering it. 
</p><p>
              The UN sturdily refutes any link between sanctions and Mr Hussein’s
              survival. But this week the United States revealed the latest steps it is
              taking to help Iraqis rid themselves of their dictator. It is to spend $5m
              attempting to solder together Iraq’s riven opposition, composed of rival
              Kurdish, Shia and other factions. The groups will be given money to
              modernise themselves and set up a new centre for political activities in
              London. Another $5m has gone into "Radio Free Iraq", to be broadcast
              from Prague. The CIA’s earlier attempt to organise a change of Iraqi
              government ended in catastrophe when its headquarters in northern Iraq
              succumbed to Kurdish treachery. London should, at least, be safer.
