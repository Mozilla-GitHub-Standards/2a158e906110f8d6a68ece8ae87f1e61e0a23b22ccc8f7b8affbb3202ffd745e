<body>
<p>
This document contains a form. There is a DIV set to be 50% of the width of the body. Inside the DIV is 
a text field that is set to be 75% of the width of its parent, the DIV. It should not be rendering at
75% the width of the BODY. Rather, it should render at 75% of the width of the parent element, 
the DIV. For testing purposes, IE5 appears to render this document properly.
