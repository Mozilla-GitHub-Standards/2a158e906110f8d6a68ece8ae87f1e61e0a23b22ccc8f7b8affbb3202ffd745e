<H2>Building Mac NGLayout</H2>
<ADDRESS>Author: <A HREF="mailto:atotic@netscape.com">Aleks Totic</A></ADDRESS>
<H4>Current status</H4>
<P>Build system is fully automated. You can checkout, build dist, and build all the projects with a perl script.
It is still rapidly evolving, and is not idiot-proof, but should be usable.</P>
<H4>Tools</H4>
<P>The tools you need are equivalent to the tools required for building Navigator The instructions are at <A HREF="../build/mac.html">http://www.mozilla.org/build/mac.html</A>.To
test your setup, you might want to build Mozilla. Note: if you are thinking of integrating NGLayout into another
product, you will not need all the 3rd party libraries Mozilla requires</P>
<H4>Building</H4>
<P>A) Using the MacCVS client, create a new CVS session file</P>

<P>B) Check out mozilla/build/mac.</P>

<P>C) Run PullNGlayout.pl from MacPerl. First time you run this script, it will prompt you for the location
of your CVS session file. This file will be used to check out the rest of the tree. You can also run the script
from MPW, but I've found that MPW perl tool often crashes.</P>

<P>D) Run BuildNGLayoutDebug.pl from MacPerl. The script will build dist and all the projects.</P> 

<P>Mac build scripts have an annoying problem in that there is no way to specify command-line options to perl.
This means that you can't specify different make options to the build script BuildNGLayoutDebug.pl without editing
the script. To customize your builds (build_all, pull_layout etc), edit the %pull and %build variables inside the
script. To build optimized binary, set $DEBUG to 0. You can also edit it to turn on the UI.</P>
<H4>Build system architecture</H4>
<P>It is modelled after the latest and greatest Mozilla build system. It uses perl that drives various Mac applications
through AppleScript. It consists of 3 perl scripts<B>:</B></P>
<P><B><TT>NGLayoutBuildList.pm</TT></B>: Contains the list of directories to check out, manifest files to be processed
for dist generation, and projects to built. It builds both debug and optimized versions. Has 3 main functions,
Checkout, BuildDist, and BuildProjects. When run for the first time, will prompt user for the location of the CVS
session file, and store the location in nglayout.cvsloc above your source tree.</P>

<P><B>PullNGLayout.pl</B>: Pulls the source tree required to build NGLayout. To use the script, 
double-click on it and it will start executing. An open-file dialog box will come up. Direct
it to the MacCVS Session file that you used to check out the script. Open the session, and the
perl script will then send a series of checkout commands to MacCVS and pull the required sources.
</P>

<P><B>BuildNGLayoutDebug.pl</B>: configures various build options and starts a build of NGLayout.</P>

<P><BLINK>Hack alert</BLINK>: To create NGLayout-specific #defines that span all the projects, I used a hack. All
Mac projects we care about include mozilla/config/mac/MacConfigInclude.h. By default, an alias to this file is
exported to dist. NGLayout makefile replaces this alias with a new one, pointing to NGLayoutConfigInclude.h, but
the alias is still named MacConfigInclude.h.</P>
<H4>XP Programmer's guide</H4>
<P>- Adding #defines to the Mac build: Edit mozilla/config/mac/NGLayoutConfigInclude.h. This file is included in
all NGLayout-related projects.</P>
<P>- Exporting headers to dist: Mac uses MANIFEST files, combined with perl. To export headers out of a directory,
create a file called 'MANIFEST' that lists all the exported headers (see other MANIFEST files for examples). To
add a new MANIFEST file to the build system, edit <TT>mozilla/build/mac/NGLayoutBuildList.pm</TT>.</P>
<H4>Misc notes:</H4>
<P>I use BBEdit and BBEdit perl extensions as my build environment. I edit BuildNGLayoutDebug.pl inside BBEdit,
and use the extensions to run it inside MacPerl.
