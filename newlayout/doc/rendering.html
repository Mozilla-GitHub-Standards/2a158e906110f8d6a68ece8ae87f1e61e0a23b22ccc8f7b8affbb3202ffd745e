 <TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">
  <TD><B>Overview</B></TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The graphics subsystem
of NGLayout is ultimately responsible for displaying "bits" on output devices.
This includes standard graphical primitives such as lines, rects, bitmaps,
text, etc. It is not a do-all rendering system. The scope of functionality
at this time is limited to what one needs in order to output HTML-like
graphics. A more in-depth description follows in the sections below.

<P>
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="70%" >
 <TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">
  <TD><B>Major Components</B></TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>
There are basically two separate pieces
to the graphics system:
<UL>
<P><LI>
Platform independent set of structs,
classes and interface definitions. These can be broken down as follows:

<P><UL>
<LI>
Geometrical primitive management (rect,
point, margin, size, transformation, etc.)

<LI>
Color definitions.

<LI>
Font specification.

<LI>
Image abstraction.

<LI>
Interfaces to be implemented per-platform.

<P><UL>
<LI>
Rendering Context

<LI>
Device Context

<LI>
Font Metrics

<LI>
Image

<LI>
Region

<LI>
Alpha blender
</UL>
</UL>

<P><LI>
Platform dependent implementation of
the per-platform interfaces listed above.
</UL>

<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="70%" >
 <TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">
  <TD><B>Implementation</B></TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>
1. Geometrical primitives.
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is a collection of
classes to represent 2D objects such as points, margins, lines, rectangles
and sizes. In addition there is a transformation class that knows how to
deal with scale, translation and matrix concatenation operations. Most
classes support operator overloading to allow mathematical operations to
be expressed succinctly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
2. Color definitions.
<BLOCKQUOTE>All colors are defined as
RGBA values in the range 0-255 bit shifted to fit into a 32 bit unsigned
word for efficiency. As a result, a certain amount of type safety is sacrificed.
Macros are provided for packing and unpacking the various color components.
There are also a set of lookup tables to go from named colors to RGBA values.</BLOCKQUOTE>
3. Font specification.
<BLOCKQUOTE>The font struct holds all
of the information necessary a particular typeface. This includes:
<UL>
<LI>family name
<LI>style
<LI>variant
<LI>weight
<LI>decorations
<LI>size
</UL>
The font struct is used in conjunction
with the device context to request a set of font metrics. The device context
has a cache of the various font metrics that have been requested to date
and creates new ones from fonts when a new font specification is encountered.</BLOCKQUOTE>
4. Image abstraction.
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is a set of interfaces
and classes that interact with the Netscape image library to convert images
from URLs to platform independent image data. To convert to actual bitmaps
that can be rendered, the platform specific image class is necessary.
<UL>
<P><LI>
An ImageGroup allows a user to manipulate
and observe a collection of image loading requests.

<P><LI>
ImageRequests can be manipulated and
observed individually.

<P><LI>
A user of the image library can provide
ImageObservers at either the group or individual request level.
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
5. Rendering Context.
<UL>The rendering context is where all
of the other pieces of the graphics library come together to actually display
bits on an ouput device. As such, the rendering context implementation
is unique to each type of output device. The rendering context, in addition
to converting geometrical primitives to bits, also does state management
including:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>font
<LI>transformation
<LI>clip rect
<LI>color
<LI>state stack
<LI>internal state as necessary per-platform
<LI>string length measurement
</UL>


<P>
Since the rendering context is
the focus point for manipulating bits, there are additional methods for
creating offscreen drawing surfaces and managing double buffering.</UL>
6. Device Context.
<UL>In order to interface with the underlying
system's graphics and UI facilities in a stateless and lightweight XP fashion,
the device context was created. The device context is essentially a set
of methods for querying the system about such things as:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>output device resolution in terms of logical units
<LI>conversion functions to go from application
defined units to device units
<LI>display zoom value
<LI>font specification to metrics conversion
<LI>creation of rendering contexts suitable
for the device
<LI>gamma correction
</UL>


<P>
A device context is desgined
to be shared among all of the higher level objects that intend to output
to the device described by the device context.</UL>
7. Font Metrics.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Font metrics contain all
of the properties of the glyphs of a typeface. Behind the XP font metrics
interface is a platform dependent implementation that may represent vector
based fonts such as Adobe Type 1, True Type, bitmap fonts or anything else
that the output device is capable of rendering. The font metric methods
are typically used by things such as a layout system to perform text measurement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;8. Image.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bitmaps usually have a very
platform specific representation. The Image class is an encapsulation of
the underlying native platform bitmap structures. Images can be either
8 or 24 bits per pixel on the XP side of the interface (whatever is closest
to the native format) and can have any representation necessary on the
implementation side of the interface. In addition to holding an array of
bytes or triples representing pixel information, images also have an optional
alpha channel and colormap for 8 bpp images. Gamma of the image color information
can be queried. Since some platforms can render bitmaps faster if the bitmap
is converted to an "opaque" format that only the underlying hardware understands,
there are methods for optimizing a bitmap and querying for optimized status.</BLOCKQUOTE>
9. Regions.
<BLOCKQUOTE>A region is a data structure
that describes a masked area through which drawing is permitted in a rendering
context. Regions can be created implicitly through various calls to the
rendering context's SetClipRect() method, or explicitly by creating a region
and adding or removing rects from the region.</BLOCKQUOTE>
10. Alpha blender.
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to allow for translucency
effects, there is an object called a Blender that knows how to take two
bitmaps, scale one by a value between 0 and 1, scale the other by the inverse
of that value and add them together.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Since the graphics system is one
of the lowest level ones in NGLayout it does not rely on the rest of the
codebase for much. With that said, it currently has knowledge of the Widget
library so that a Rendering context can be initialized from the state information
contained by a Widget (truth be told, a rendering context can also be initialized
from a view, but this dependency will soon be removed).

<P>For printed output, the application
using the graphics library will be responsible for printer discovery and
initialization of a device context with information relevant to the printer
that it represents.

<P>
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="70%" >
 <TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">
  <TD><B>Roadmap</B></TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>


<P>Colormap support is complete in the
Image abstraction code, but has not yet been fleshed out in the rest of
the graphics system on all platforms. We anticipate storing the colormap
in the Device context since there is a one-to-one mapping between an output
device and a device context. The default colormap will be a color cube
very similar to, if not the same as, that used by Communicator 4. Applications
that wish to modify the color map will essentially clone the device context
and then be responsible for selecting the colormap in the device into the
display when their windows get focus. This will basically mean that a Device
context represents all output device parameters including color lookup
and that when a different colormap is desired you are considered to be
outputting to a different device. An interface representing colormap abstraction
of platform native colormap structures will be necessary to achieve this.

<P>There is a very large hole where
printing is supposed to be. This entails creating a new set of rendering
context, device context, font metric and image objects that know how to
deal with printed output. Printer discovery is a separate issue that will
be kept at the application level.

<P>While the APIs for document zooming
(scaling) are there, very little is underneath them. Some work needs to
be done at the applicaition level to properly support zooming, and the
rest needs to be done in the device context.

<P>

<P>We need to look at issues regarding
internationalization including font encoding, performance and font metric
APIs.
