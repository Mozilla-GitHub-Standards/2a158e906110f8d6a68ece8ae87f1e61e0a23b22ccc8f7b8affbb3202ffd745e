<P>The NGLayout views subsystem is designed
to support arbitrary positioning, sizing and depth sorting of overlapping
rectangles of content in a platform independent fashion. Most NGLayout
rendering operations begin by "damaging" a portion of the area currently
being displayed on an output device and then walking over a view tree in
z depth order allowing each view to repair parts of the damaged area they
occupy. Event handling within NGLayout also goes through the view system
giving view objects the first opportunity to handle event processing (within
each view, there is generally content represented by layout Frames that
do most of the real event processing). View update operations can either
happen in an offscreen buffer or directly on the output device depending
on the complexity of the anticipated update. Timed refreshes also occur
allowing many damage requests to be processed as a single update to the
output device. In addition to representing specially positioned content,
a view may also represent an underlying platform native window through
it's association with the Widget subsystem. The Widgets can be used to
represent application controls such as scrollbars and top level windows
and content objects such as HTML form elements. See the Widgets documentation
for further information.

<P>Currently, there are four different
classes within the view system. Naturally, more can be added as deemed
necessary:
<UL>
<P><LI>
Basic View class responsible for positioning,
sizing, painting and event handling as a container for underlying content.
Currently, the "compositor," which is responsible for handling issues of
transparent views when painting, also lives inside the base view class
implementation. In order to allow new types of views to be created without
the need for subclassing off of the base view, this code will most likely
move into the ViewManager.

<P><LI>
Scrolling View which has private child
views representing scrollbars and additional methods for handling the scrolling
of an additional child view that the owner of the scrolling view can add
to the scrolling view.

<P><LI>
View Manager which coordinates all operations
done to/through the view hierarchy including:

<UL>
<P><LI>
child view insertion, removal and sorting.

<P><LI>
event handling.

<P><LI>
damage repair coordination.

<P><LI>
view state changes (position, size,
clip rect, z index, visibility)
</UL>

<P><LI>
View Observer which allows an application
to receive notification when changes occur involving a view. Currently,
these are:

<UL>
<P><LI>
painting

<P><LI>
event handling

<P><LI>
on screen position change
</UL>
</UL>

  <TD><B>Implementation</B></TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>


<P>1. View Manager.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Applications create views
and then added them to the view hierarchy through the view manager. From
that point on, the application requests that changes be made to views via
the view manager. This allows the view manager to "do the right thing"
when views are changed. Typically this means minimizing the damage repair
area and frequency of updates. As mentioned previously, views are arranged
in a hierarchy. The relationship of sibling views is maintained through
either an absolute z index for each view, or above/below relative to another
view. When the view hierarchy is traversed, views are encountered in top
down order and from nearest z to furthest z.</BLOCKQUOTE>
2. View class.
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is the base view class
and the one generally created by content that requires a view. Examples
of such content are CSS positioned elements, Communicator 4 layers, objects
that require Widgets such as form elements, etc. Since views are designed
to act as containers for content, there is a link to that content which
can be set and queried with the Get/SetClientData() methods.

<P>In general, views hold state, but
don't do much in terms of changing or manipulating other objects. That
job is left to the view manager.

<P>Child views are not clipped to the
boundaries of their parent views unless a cliprect is specifically set
on a view. A clip rect clips the content displayed by a view and any of
it's children.

<P>The view contains a "compositor"
which processes the view tree at rendering time to optimally paint the
damaged area. This involves determining if any of the views are "transparent"
and then doing back-to-front/front-to-back view processing to repair the
damage. Views currently have an opacity property that the compositor will
use to alpha blend views together. This functionality will be moving into
the view manager.</BLOCKQUOTE>
3. Scrolling view.
<BLOCKQUOTE>The scrolling view, which
is used as the root level view for NGLayout documents, is essentially designed
to act as a container which expects that it's size will be smaller than
the views that it contains. It also assumes that the application will want
to be able to scroll over the area that is "inside" of it. As such it will
automatically sprout scrollbars when the scrolling view is too small to
display all of it's contents. It has additional APIs over the standard
view to allow the application to get and set the offset into the visible
content area and to recompute the size of the scrollbar thumb and position
based on the sizes of the objects that it contains.</BLOCKQUOTE>
4. View Observer.
<BLOCKQUOTE>When views need to paint
or have events handled that do not relate to the view, the observer's Paint()
and HandleEvent() methods are called. The application can query the affected
view for client data stored there by the application to associate the view
with an application specific object. In addition, if an application object
needs to know when it's position has been changed on the "screen" it can
be notified of this by the observer.</BLOCKQUOTE>

  <TD><B>Dependencies</B></TD>

</TABLE>

<UL>
<P><LI>
Since views may have Widgets associated
with them, and as views change shape they need to tell the Widgets about
these changes, there is a dependency on the Widget library.

<P><LI>
Much of what the view manager does involves
output refresh management so it has knowledge of the graphics system.

<P><LI>
We would like to be able to alpha blend
views together.
