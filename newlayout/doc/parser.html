<HR WIDTH="100%"><h2>New Layout: Parsing
Engine</h2>
Author: <a href="mailto:rickg@netscape.com">Rick 
Gessner</a> <BR>
Last update: 1May98
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="70%" >
<TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">
<TD><B>Overview</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The parser is the first stage in the sequence 
of systems that interact in order for a browser to display HTML documents. In 
order for NGLayout to be successful, the parser must be fast, extensible and above 
all it must offer robust error handling. 
<P>The parsing engine in NGLayout has a modular 
  design that actually permits the system to parse almost any kind of data. (Of 
  course the engine is optimized for HTML). <BR>
  
<BR>
  Conceptually speaking, a parsing "engine" 
  is used to transform a source document from one form into another. In the case 
  of HTML, the parser transforms the hierarchy of HTML tags (the source form) 
  into a form that the underlying layout and display engine requires (the target 
  form). 
<p>
<BR>
  
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="70%" >
<TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">
<TD><B>Major Components</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The parsing engine provides a set of
components which serve in the transformation process as a document moves
from source to target form. We refer to these objects as components because
they are combined dynamically a runtime to achive the transformation. By
substituting a different set of components, you can perform alternate transformations.

<P><B>Scanner Component</B>
<BR>
  The first major component in the parsing 
  engine is the Scanner. The Scanner provides an incremental &quot;push-based&quot; 
  API that offers methods for accessing characters in the input stream (usually 
  a URL), finding particular sequences, collating input data and skipping over 
  unwanted data. Our experience has shown than a fairly simple scanner can be 
  used effectively to parse everything from HTML and XML to C++. 
<P><B>Parser Component</B>
<BR>The second major element in the
system is the parser component itself. The parser component controls and
coordinates the activities the other components in the system. This approach
relies upon the fact that regardless of the form of the source document,
the transformation process remains the same (as we'll explain later). While
other components of the system are meant to be dynamically substituted
according to the source document type, it is rarely necessary to alter
the parser component.

<P>The parser also drives tokenization. Tokenization 
  refers to the process of coalating atomic units (characters) in the input stream 
  into higher level structures called <I>tokens</I>. So for example, the HTML 
  tokenizer converts a raw input stream of characters into HTML tags. For maximum 
  flexibility, the tokenizer makes no assumptions about the underlying grammer. 
  Instead, the details of the actual grammer being parsed is up to the DTD object 
  that understands the constructs that comprise the grammar. The importance of 
  this design decision is that it allows the engine to dynamically vary the language 
  it is tokenizing without changing the tokenizer itself. 
<P><B>DTD Component</B> <BR>
  The final component in the parser engine 
  is the DTD, which describes the rules for well-formed and/or valid documents 
  in the target grammar. In HTML, the DTD declares and defines the tag set, the 
  associated set of attributes and the hierarchical (nesting) rules of the HTML 
  tags. Once again, by separating the DTD component from the other components 
  in the parser engine it becomes possible to use the same system to parse a much 
  wide range of document types. Simply put, this means that the same parser can 
  provide input to the browser, biased (via the DTD) to behave like Navigator, 
  IE, or any other HTML browser. The same can be said for XML.
<P><b>Sink Component</b> <br>
  Once the tokenization process is complete, 
  the parse-engine needs to emit its content (tokens). Since the parser doesn't 
  know anything about the document model, the containing application must provide 
  a "content-sink". The sink is a simple API that accepts a container, leaf and 
  text nodes, and constructs the underlying document model accordingly. The DTD 
  interacts with the sink to cause the proper content-model to be constructed 
  based on the input set of tokens.
<P>While these objects may seem confusing at 
  first, this simple diagram illustrates the runtime relationships between these 
  objects: 
<P><B>&lt;insert

<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="70%" >
<TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">
<TD><B>Implementation</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<B>Phase 1 -- Object Construction</B>
<BR>
Parsing a document is a straightforward operation. 
The containing application initiates the parse by creating a nIURL object, a nsTokenizer 
object and nsHTMLParse object. The parser is assigned a sink and a DTD (remember: 
the DTD understands the grammar of the document being parsed, while the sink interfaces 
allows the DTD to properly build a content model). 
<P><B>Phase 2 -- Opening an Input Stream</B>
<BR>
  The parse process begins when the URL is 
  opened, and content is provided in for the form of a network input stream. The 
  stream is given to the scanner, which controls all access. The parse-engine 
  then instructs the tokenizer to initiate the tokenization phase. Tokenization 
  is an incremental process, and can interrupt when the scanner is blocked awaiting 
  network data.
<P><B>Phase 3 -- Tokenization</B>
<BR>
  The tokenizer controls and coordinates the 
  tokenization of the input stream into a collection of CTokens. (Different grammars 
  will have their own subclasses of CToken, as we've done to create CHTMLToken, 
  as well as their own iDTD). As the tokenizer runs, it repeatedly calls the method 
  <B>GetToken()</B>. This continues until EOF occurs on the input stream, or an 
  unrecoverable error occurs. 
<P><B>Phase 4 -- Token Iteration/Document
Construction</B>
<BR>
  After the tokenization phase completes, the 
  parses enters the token iteration phase which validates the document and causes 
  a content model to be constructed. Token iteration proceeds until an unrecoverable 
  error occurs, or the parser has visited each token. The tokens are collected 
  into related groups of information according to the rules provided by the nsDTD 
  class. The DTD controls the order in which tokens can appear in relation to 
  each other. At well defined times during this process, the parser notifies the 
  content sink about the parse context, instructing the sink to construct the 
  document according to the state of parser. 
<P><B>Phase 5 -- Object Destruction</B> 
  <BR>
  Once tokenization and iteration have concluded, 
  the objects in the parse system are destroyed to conserve memory. 
  <BR>
<P>

  <tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 
    <td><b>Also Of Interest...</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In addition to parsing of documents and 
  dynamic DTD support, the parse engine also offers support for data i/o observers. 
  The intention of these interfaces is to allow secure objects to hook into the 
  i/o system at runtime, transforming the underlying stream before the parser 
  see it. This can be useful in cases where preprocessing needs to occur, or where 
  transforms from foreign document types into HTML should occur.</p>
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="70%" >
<TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">
<TD><B>Dependencies</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The parse engine is dependent upon the
following classes/systems:
<UL>
<LI>
nsString</LI>

<LI>
nsCore.h (and prtypes.h)</LI>

<LI>
The XP_COM system</LI>

<LI>
Netlib (for urls and input stream)</LI>
</UL>

<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="70%" >
<TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">
<TD><B>Roadmap</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The next major improvements in the parser will 
focus on the following areas: 
<UL>
  <LI> Support for well-formed and/or valid 
    XML documents.</LI>
  <LI>
Support 
    for document &quot;processors&quot; such as XSL and others.</LI>
  <LI> Backward compatibility -- HTML DTD improvements.</LI>
  <LI> Performance tuning.</LI>
</UL>
 
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="70%" >
<TR BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC">
<TD><B>Known Bugs</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
At this time, the DTD's are still work
in progress (WIP). The are expected to improve incrementally over the next
few months.
