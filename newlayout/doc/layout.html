<BR>HTML layout is the set of classes
that implement the HTML layout semantics.
<BR>
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="80%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" >
<TR>
<TD><B>Major Components</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<BR>The major components of HTML layout
are body, block, inline, list item, table, and the leaf components like
BR, IMG, and SPACER.

<P><B>Content Model</B>. The base class
for leaf HTML content objects is nsHTMLTagContent, which is for content
objects that have HTML attributes. Most HTML container tags (for example,
P, DIV, SPAN, etc.) have content objects that are instances of class nsHTMLContainer.
nsHTMLContainer is a derived class of nsHTMLTagContent which manages an
array of child content nodes.

<P><B>Frame creation</B>. Whether an
element is displayed as block or inline is not a function of the HTML tag,
but of the associated stylistic information (see struct nsStyleDisplay).
Class nsHTMLContent is the abstract base class for all HTML content objects.
It creates the one and only content delegate (class ContentDelegate) that
is used for all HTML content. When asked to create a frame the HTML content
delegate asks the content object to create the frame.

<P>nsHTMLContainer responds by looking
at the display type. If it's a block then it creates a block frame, if
it's inline then it creates an inline frame, and if it's a list item then
it creates a list item frame.

<P>The mapping of HTML elements to either
block or inline is controlled by our default UA style sheet (file ua.css).

<P><B>Display None</B>. To simplify
managing of the child frames, we always create and insert a frame even
if the display type is set to <B>none</B>. The frame that's created is
of type nsFrame, and it has a size of (0, 0) and no stylistic information
(no border, padding, ...). Because nsFrame is a leaf frame no child frames
are generated, regardless of whether the associated content is a container.
<p><BR>
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="80%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" >
<TR>
<TD><B>Body, Block, and Inline Implementation</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<BR><B>Body Frame</B>. Class nsBodyFrame
is the frame class that's used for displaying the BODY tag. The associated
content object is an instance of class BodyPart (derived class of nsHTMLContainer).
nsBodyFrame supports being used as a pseudo frame, and it's often used
that way. For example, table cells create a body pseudo frame for displaying
the table cell data.

<P>The body frame is basically a vertical
box that arranges its block-level elements from top to bottom. If it encounters
an inline element, the body frame wraps the inline element in a block pseudo
frame.

<P><B>Block Frame</B>. Class nsCSSBlockFrame
is the frame class that's used for displaying block-level elements. Block
frame is a 2D layout class that lays out its block-level elements from
top to bottom, and its inline elements from left to right (or right to
left). Block frame has <I>logical</I> lines, but it does <B>not</B> actually
have line child frames. This greatly reduces the number of frames, which
means we lay out faster and we use less memory.

<P>Block frame also supports being used
as a pseudo frame.

<P>Class nsListItemFrame, which handles
list items, is derived from nsCSSBlockFrame. It manages the placement and
painting of the list item bullet.

<P><B>Inline Frame</B>. Class nsCSSInlineFrame
is the frame class that's used for displaying inline elements. Inline frames
are simple horizontal boxes that arrange their child frames either left
to right or right to left depending on the stylistic direction.

<P>Inline frames do <B>not</B> support
being used as a pseudo frame. This reflects the fact that we haven't needed
to use

<P><B>Reflow Unmapped. Reflow Mapped</B>.
As you look through the HTML frame clases you'll see some similarities
in the code, and you'll see some common terminology:
<DL>
<DT>
Reflow Unmapped</DT>

<DD>
This refers to the process of creating
new frames for content that hasn't yet been mapped.</DD>

<DT>
Reflow Mapped</DT>

<DD>
This refers to the process of reflowing
the existing child frames.</DD>

<DT>
Pushing</DT>

<DD>
When reflowing mapped children, if a
child frame doesn't fit within the available space then the child frame
is "pushed" to the next-in-flow.</DD>

<DT>
Pulling</DT>

<DD>
When reflowing mapped children, if all
the existing child frames fit and there's still room left, child frames
are "pulled up" from the next-in-flow.</DD>

<DT>
Overflow List</DT>

<DD>
This is a list of child frames that
don't fit within the available space of their current geometric parent.
Because the frame doesn't have a next-in-flow there's no place to "push"
the child frames, so instead they're placed on an overflow list.</DD>
</DL>
<B>Placeholder Frames</B>. Items that
don't affect the flow, like floaters and absolutely positioned elements,
are handled by creating a (0, 0) sized "placeholder" frame that's inserted
in the flow. See the sections on <A HREF="#Floaters">floaters</A> for details.
<p><BR>
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="80%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" >
<TR>
<TD><B>Leaf Components</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The base class for most of the simple
leaf frames is nsLeafFrame: an abstract class that provides simple fixed-size
layout for leaf objects (images, form elements, etc). nsLeafFrame handles
painting of borders, and provides a simpler sizing protocol interface.
<p><BR>
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="80%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" >
<TR>
<TD><B>Table Implementation</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<B>Overview</B>. Tables are represented
as a set of content objects representing the table structure, and a corresponding
set of frame objects representing the geometric layout of the table in
a particular view. There can be any number of frame models for a single
content model.

<P>All the table code is contained within
the layout/html/table sub-directory.

<P><B>Table content</B> is stored as
a normalized HTML 4.0 table. Table layout reflects the content according
to a set of constraints. The constraints are a combination of physical
(i.e. the width of the browser window), contentual (content of each cell),
and stylistic (i.e. the HTML WIDTH attribute, CSS Style, or a compatibility
mode, etc).

<P>The hierarchy for a table is:
<UL>
<LI>
one nsTablePart (mandatory)</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
any number of nsTableCaptions (optional).
Multiple captions are supported even though they are not legal in HTML</LI>

<LI>
one nsTableColumnGroup (mandatory)</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
any number of nsTableColumns (optional)</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
any number of nsTableRowGroups, one
TBODY row group is mandatory. Additional TBODY row groups are optional.
Any number of THEAD and TFOOT row groups are optional</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
any number of nsTableRows (at least
one per row group is mandatory)</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
any number of nsTableCells (at least
one per row is mandatory)</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
one nsBodyPart per cell, containing
arbitrary HTML content</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
If the HTML input does not contain a
required element, an implicit element is generated for the missing input.
For example, HTML 3.2 files will not include TBODY, so an implicit TBODY
row group will be inserted in the content.

<P>nsTablePart maintains an nsCellMap,
which is a structured description of all the cells in a table. It is the
nsCellMap that holds information about the effects of row and column spans
on cells. The cell map is a regular <I>n x m</I> grid onto which cells
are overlaid, allowing us to easily answer questions about what cell occupies
a logical region in the table, even for irregular tables that include complex
row and column spans.

<P><B>Layout</B>. Table layout is represented
by a hierarchy of frame objects that describe the geometry of the table.
The frame model closely mimics the content model, with a few exceptions
noted below.
<UL>
<LI>
one nsTableOuterFrame (mandatory)</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
any number of nsTableCaptionFrames (optional)</LI>

<LI>
one nsTableFrame (mandatory, referred
to as the "inner table frame")</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
any number of nsTableRowGroupFrames
(at least one is mandatory)</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
any number of nsTableRowFrames (at least
one is mandatory per row group frame)</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
any number of nsTableCellFrames (at
least one is mandatory per row frame)</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
one nsBodyFrame pseudo frame per cell,
containing arbitrary frames</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
The outer frame is required because
the captions, while logically belonging to the table, do not behave geometrically
like a child of the table. Row groups that are THEAD or TFOOT are replicated
across tables that are split (between columns or between pages, for example).

<P>Table layout is determined in a 3-step
process. In the first step, the table is flowed into an infinitely wide
and tall space. This gives us the minimum and desired sizes for every cell
in the table. In the second step, the table constraints are factored in
and widths are assigned to every cell. In the third step, heights are assigned
to every cell based on the computed width constraint. The results of the
first step are cached and only need to be recomputed when content or constraints
are changed.

<P><B>The near future</B>. Table layout
is designed to support multiple notions of "correct" table layout. An nsITableLayoutStrategy
interface will soon be added that defines how a table should be laid out.
We envision at least three implementations of nsITableLayoutStrategy: one
for Netscape Navigator compatibility, one for Internet Explorer compatibility,
and one for full HTML 4.0/CSS 2.0 support. An implementation of nsITableLayoutStrategy
will be selected at run-time for a particular view of a table based on
the stylistic properties of the table.

<P>Table layout is designed to support
intelligent pagination. This means that tables will break atreasonable
places across boundaries (pages, columns, etc). So for example, table pagination
will be biased to keep captions and tables together, to break on row boundaries
so cell data is kept together as much as possible, and THEAD and TFOOT
information is replicated across breaks.

<P>For the latest information on where
tables are going, see the <A HREF="table_todo.html">table to-do list</A>.

<P>
<TABLE COLS=1 WIDTH="80%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" >
<TR>
<TD><B>Floaters</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<A NAME="Floaters"></A>When reflowing
unmapped content and we get to an element that wants to be floated, a PlaceholderFrame
is created. The placeholder frame itself is just a (0, 0) sized frame that's
placed in the flow and indicates that the content has been mapped.

<P>The placeholder frame creates the
actual floater frame, but it is <B>not</B> inserted in the flow. Instead,
the placeholder frame walks the frame hierarchy (geometric parents) looking
for a frame that implements the nsIFloaterContainer interface. This is
the containing block for the floater.

<P>The containing block is notified
of the floater (see the AddFloater() member function). The floater is then
either placed at the current line, or added to a to-do list of floaters
to be placed below the current line. The frame itself is inserted as a
child of the body frame; this keeps it out of the list of flowed children.
The containing block finds the frame where it should insert the floater
by walking the frame hierarchy looking for a frame that implements the
nsIAnchoredItems interface.

<P>The containing block also notifies
the space manager (nsISpaceManager) that the space is now unavailable (see
AddRectRegion() member function).

<P><B>Runaround</B> (flowing text around
the anchored item) happens because the block frame calls the space manager
to get a band of available space. The band data indicates which parts of
the band are available, and which parts are unavailable.

<P>The space manager is created by the
body frame. Each body frame has its own space manager, which means that
each table cell has an associated space manager.

<P>How runaround works depends on the
block-level frame being reflowed. If you're willing to interact directly
with the space manager, implement interface nsIRunaround and you get access
to the band data. Do this if your frame supports being non-rectangular.
This is what block frames does.

<P>If you don't implement nsIRunaround
then your parent frame will place you in the available space between the
left and right floaters.
