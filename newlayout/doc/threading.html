<h2>New Layout: Threading Model 
</h2>
Updated: March 10, 1998 
<hr>
This document describes 
the threading model for the nglayout engine and related services.  
<H3> Overview</H3>
There is one thread 
per top level window, called the UI thread. This thread receives events from the 
native window systems' event system and distributes the events to the appropriate 
handles (widgets, callbacks, etc.) This thread does not do network I/O (the network 
library manages a collection of threads to do network I/O). Modal windows are 
handled by having this thread block while waiting for a response from a modal 
dialog.  
<P>Layout occurs 
  on this thread, including the original parsing and processing of a document 
  load, and subsequent incremental layout operations which include resize reflow, 
  dom activity, and editing. </p>
To prevent the UI 
thread from being unresponsive during large scale layout or <br>
javascript computations, each of these engines has an interface <br>
which provides a progress call back. The application can choose to <br>
abort the layout or javascript execution based on it's own criteria. H<br>
ere is the proposed interface:  
<UL>
  <pre> <TT>enum nsExecProgressStatus    {</TT> 
   <TT> eExecProgressStatus_Continue = 0,</TT> 
   <TT> eExecProgressStatus_Stop</TT> 
   <TT>};</TT>     </pre>
  <pre><TT>class nsIExecProgress      : public nsISupports {</TT> 
     <TT>public:</TT> 
     <TT> virtual nsExecProgressStatus Update() = 0;</TT> 
     <TT>};</TT><TT></TT></pre>
</UL>
At some reasonable rate the 
Update procedure will be called to give the outer invocation a chance to abort 
or continue the execution.  
<P>For systems which do not 
  support pre-emptive threading, this callback is also an opportune time to yield 
  the processor to other threads. 
<P><B><I>The above API is speculative.</I></B> 
    
  
<H3> Examples</H3>
Example 1: A javascript 
event handler sits and spins for an eternity. The javascript evaluation call takes 
a pointer to an implementation of nsIExecProgress. Periodically the javascript 
evaluator will invoke the interface to see if execution should continue. The UI 
thread which invoked the script can set a timeout, say a couple of seconds, and 
after the time has expired can abort the evaluation (or put up a modal dialog 
and see if the user wants the operation to continue; it's really up to the outer 
context to decide what to do).  
<P>Example 2: A document 
  is loading and the user clicks on a link to go somewhere else before the document 
  is finished loading. In this case, the UI thread needs enough cycles for the 
  cursor to be responsive and for the user gesture to be translated and mapped 
  into aborting the document load and moving to a new location. Layout will also 
  take a pointer to an implementation of nsIExecProgress and will periodically 
  invoke it to see if layout should continue. 
<P>Example 3: A dcoument 
  is loading and the user hits the stop, back, forward, etc. button. This is really 
  the same as example 2. 
  
<H3> Netlib</H3>
Because the networking 
I/O is now being done on a seperate thread, the netlib1 library will need modifications. 
There are two areas:  
<UL>
  <LI> First, any 
    usage of the MWContext by the netlib code needs to be removed and replaced 
    with a "NetContext" abstraction. This way an environment using netlib can 
    provide the necessary data for ftp/gopher passwords, and deal with the security 
    dialog issues.</LI>
  <LI> Second, when 
    data is ready to be consumed by a netlib presentation stream handler, we need 
    to get the data from the netlib thread to the consuming thread.</LI>
</UL>
<B><I>How does layout 
which is running on the UI thread implement a blocking model I/O system in the 
face of this???</I></B>  
<H3> Other Libraries</H3>
The rule of the day 
is: No global data that isn't thread safe. Thr reason is that once you have multiple 
threads using these libraries (minimally there will be multiple UI threads) then 
you have to protect your global data with locks. Fortunately we have NSPR20 and 
it runs everywhere.  
<P><B><I>list out 
  each library and indicate how much work needs to be done</I></B> 
<H3> FE Code</H3>
The FE code operates 
with the same restrictions as the other libraries - global data must be protected. 
However, for the X and MAC FE's there is no "thread per event loop" concept, therefore 
we will need to fabricate one. This translates into either dispatching UI events 
across thread boundaries or, having a single UI thread on those systems and having 
them deal with modality and lockout problems (they will be inherently less parallel 
than windows).  
<H3> Issues</H3>
Can javascript support 
re-entrancy? What if I want to pop a modal dialog that is written using an HTML 
dialog that has javascript in it? <BR>
