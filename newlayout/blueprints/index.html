<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
Welcome to the NGLayout Developer Blueprints, where you'll find information to help you get started using NGLayout in
your Web development projects. The Developer Blueprints are meant to offer detailed API references covering NGLayout's support for
HTML 4.0, CSS 1,  CSS 2, the Document Object Model Level 1 Core and HTML, XML, XSL, and other standards-based technologies.
The Developer Blueprints don't contain any thorough "How to" or "Tutorial" guides; the format is strictly that of an API
reference for now.
