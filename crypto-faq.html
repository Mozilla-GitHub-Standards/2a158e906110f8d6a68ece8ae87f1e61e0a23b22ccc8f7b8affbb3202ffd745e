<h1>Mozilla Crypto FAQ</h1></center>

<center><b>Version 2.11</b><br>
Frank Hecker<br>
<a href="mailto:hecker@mozilla.org">hecker@mozilla.org</a><br>
September 10, 2000</center>

<p>In this document I try to answer some frequently asked questions
about the Mozilla web browser and mail/news client and its support for
SSL, S/MIME, and related features based on cryptographic
technology. Note that this document is for your information only and
is not intended as legal advice. If you wish to develop and
distribute cryptographic software, particularly for commercial sale or
distribution, then you should consult an attorney with expertise in
the particular laws and regulations that apply in your jurisdiction.

<p>I've updated this version of the Mozilla Crypto FAQ to discuss the
situation now that the RSA public key algorithm is in the public
domain and a full open source crypto implementation is being added to
the Mozilla code base. Information in the FAQ also reflects the new
U.S. encryption export regulations published on January 14, 2000, the
release on February 11, 2000, of source code for SSL, S/MIME, and
general PKI functionality for use in the Mozilla project, and the
"Bernstein advisory" issued by the Bureau of Export Administration on
February 17, 2000.

<p>The questions in this FAQ address Mozilla's support for encryption
and related security functionality, information important to Mozilla
contributors relating to encryption functionality in Mozilla, and
general questions on U.S. regulation of encryption technology.

<h2>Cryptographic functionality in Mozilla</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<a name="1-1"></a><b>Have all the issues with Mozilla and crypto now
been resolved?</b>

<p>Almost. Now that the RSA patent is in the public domain, Mozilla
crypto development can proceed with minimal restrictions. In the near
future the Mozilla code base will include a complete open source
cryptographic library, and Mozilla will include SSL support as a
standard feature.

<p>After the U.S. government relaxed U.S. export regulations in
January 2000 to allow export of source code for open source software
implementing encryption, the major remaining legal obstacle to Mozilla
crypto development was the fact that RSA Security, Inc., held a
U.S. patent on the RSA public key algorithm. In February 2000 iPlanet
E-Commerce Solutions (a Sun-Netscape Alliance) released source code
through mozilla.org for the Personal Security Manager and Network
Security Services software; this source code included support for the
SSL protocol, but due to the RSA patent and related legal issues it
did not originally contain code for RSA or other cryptographic
algorithms.

<p>On September 6, 2000, RSA Security released the RSA patent into the
public domain, two weeks before the patent was scheduled to expire
(on September 20, 2000). Shortly thereafter the NSS developers began
work on an open source implementation of the RSA algorithm; that code,
together with code previously developed for other cryptographic
algorithms, will be included in a new version 3.1 of the NSS open
source cryptographic and PKI library.

<p>This new RSA-capable version of NSS will then be included in a
future version of the open source PSM software, which will provide SSL
support for Mozilla. At that point both NSS and PSM will be completely
buildable using the open source code available from the mozilla.org
site, and NSS and PSM will be included in the Mozilla binary releases
distributed by mozilla.org.

<p>For more information on the RSA patent see the
<a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/news/pr/000906-1.html">RSA Security press release</a>
announcing release of the patent into the public domain, and the
<a href="http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?&pn=US04405829__">RSA patent</a>
itself.

<p>For information on new US encryption export regulations, see the
U.S. Department of Commerce
<a href="http://www.cdt.org/crypto/admin/000112commerceannounce.shtml">press
release</a>
announcing the new regulations as well as the
<a href="http://www.cdt.org/crypto/admin/000114cryptoregs.pdf">updated
regulations</a> (PDF)
themselves.
Export of source code for open source software is addressed in
<a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/pdf/740.pdf">Part
740</a> (PDF),
section 740.13(e), "Unrestricted encryption source code"; export of
binaries is addressed in 740.17.

source code being developed as part of the Mozilla project, see the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/">PKI project page</a>

<a href="http://home.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease793.html">mozilla.org
press release</a>.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>
<a name="1-2"></a><b>What functionality is implemented by the Mozilla
crypto code released so far? When will Mozilla get full support for
SSL and S/MIME?</b>

<p>The Mozilla crypto code will shortly include a full implementation
of the RSA and other cryptographic algorithms; that implementation
will form the basis of a complete open source SSL implementation for
Mozilla. S/MIME support is also under development, but may not be
available in Mozilla until after the 1.0 release.

<p>Version 3.1 of the Network Security Services library will include a
complete open source implementation of the cryptographic algorithms
needed for Mozilla SSL support, including the RSA public key algorithm
(now in the public domain). NSS 3.1 will be available in beta form in
September 2000, with the final release to follow in October 2000. NSS
3.1 will be used in the 1.3 release of PSM, which will provide a
complete open source implementation of SSL for Mozilla. PSM 1.3 will
also provide support for Mozilla users to obtain personal digital
certificates and perform other PKI-related functions.

<p>Note that due to various implementation issues, PSM support for
Mozilla on the Macintosh is lagging somewhat behind PSM support on
Windows, Linux, and other platforms. Also note that the NSS
developers are creating code for support of S/MIME secure messages;
however full S/MIME support within Mozilla will require further
development, and may not be available until after the Mozilla 1.0
release.

<p>Finally, note that NSS (and thus PSM) can also be built using a
licensed copy of the RSA BSAFE Crypto-C library (versions 4.1 or
5.0). iPlanet E-Commerce Solutions has released Netscape-branded
binary versions of Personal Security Manager that incorporate the RSA
BSAFE Library; the Netscape PSM software can be installed and used
with binary Mozilla versions.

page.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><a name="1-3"></a><b>What is the open source license used for the
Mozilla crypto code?</b>

<p>The released source code is dual-licensed under the MPL and
the GPL.

<p>The Mozilla SSL, S/MIME, and PKI source code is licensed under the
Mozilla Public License (version 1.1), with the GNU General Public
License (version 2.0 or later) available as an alternate license. You
may choose to use the code either under the terms of the MPL or under
the terms of the GPL.

<p>This form of licensing was chosen to allow the released Personal
Security Manager and Network Security Services source code to be used
in as many contexts as possible; for example, the PSM and NSS code can
be used in Mozilla under MPL terms, and can also be used in GNU and
other projects under GPL terms. If you create and distribute
modifications to the original PSM and NSS code, we ask that you in
turn make such modifications available under both the MPL and
GPL. (Note that mozilla.org will not accept contributed modifications
into future PSM/NSS source releases unless they are so licensed.)

<p>For more information see the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html">Mozilla Public
License</a>
and the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>.
Specific questions about licensing of the PSM and NSS source
code should be directed to the
<a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.license">netscape.public.mozilla.license</a>
newsgroup or the associated
<a href="mailto:mozilla-license-request@mozilla.org?subject=subscribe">mozilla-license
mailing list</a>.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><a name="1-4"></a><b>Will mozilla.org accept new contributions of
crypto code?</b>

<p>Yes, as long as patent or other legal issues do not prevent such
code from being used by the general community of Mozilla
developers. New contributions of crypto code should also be reviewed
and approved by the appropriate Mozilla module owners, just as with
any other Mozilla contributions.

algorithms and implementation techniques, see the questions relating

See the Mozilla
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/">open source PKI
projects</a>
pages for the names and email addresses of the Mozilla module owners
for crypto-related code.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><a name="1-5"></a><b>What about Mozilla support for PGP and other protocols
besides SSL and S/MIME? Will we be able to use GNU Privacy
Guard or other PGP versions with Mozilla?</b>

<p>Support for PGP and other security-related protocols and formats
can potentially be added to Mozilla in the same manner as SSL and
S/MIME; if anyone is interested in working on such support within the
Mozilla project then they are welcome to do so. We know of at least
two efforts which may produce PGP support for Mozilla.

<p>As noted above, the PSM code implements SSL and (in the future)
S/MIME support for Mozilla by taking advantage of generic high-level
Mozilla public APIs used to add new protocols and message
formats. These same APIs can be used to add support to Mozilla for
other security schemes, including potentially PGP. If anyone is
interested on working such support within the Mozilla project then
they are welcome to do so. However note that, as with SSL and S/MIME,
mozilla.org will not host code implementing patented algorithms that
are not generally usable by all Mozilla developers (including Mozilla
developers creating products for commercial sale and distribution).

<p>Also note that Mozilla support for PGP and other security schemes
may also be made available by commercial security vendors or by
independent developers, using the various public APIs already present
in Mozilla. Based on statements made in various Internet forums it
appears that the developers of GNU Privacy Guard may create a plugin
module to support invocation of GnuPG functionality from Mozilla;
Network Associates may also create a commercial PGP plugin for
Mozilla. You should contact those vendors or developers directly for
more information concerning their plans.

<p>See the Open Directory references for
<a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools/Cryptography/PGP/">general
PGP information</a>, including contact information for companies and
independent developers producing PGP implementations.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><a NAME="1-6"></a><b>Is information available describing the
format of the PSM key and certificate database, so that other software
can reuse existing user keys and certificates managed by PSM?</b>

<p>Yes, documentation of the database format is available; however
we cannot guarantee that the format of the database will remain
unchanged in the future.

<p>The initial release of SSL, S/MIME, and general PKI source code
from iPlanet E-Commerce Solutions includes some documentation on the
format of the key and certificate database. As with Mozilla
documentation in general, mozilla.org will be glad to host any other
documentation contributed to describe database formats, APIs, and
other technical aspects of the released SSL, S/MIME, and PKI source
code.

<p>However, as with APIs internal to Mozilla modules, mozilla.org
cannot guarantee that the format of the key and certificate database
will remain unchanged over time; in particular, changes may be
introduced at some point that break compatibility with existing
applications. Also, changing the database directly from an
application risks causing database corruption and subsequent problems
in PSM and applications like Mozilla using PSM. For these reasons we
strongly recommend that Mozilla developers and others access the key
and certificate database only through public APIs provided by the NSS
library.

<p>For more information see the documentation for the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/db_formats.html">cert7.db certificate database</a>.

<h2>Information for Mozilla contributors</h2>

<ol>

<li><a name="2-1"></a><b>I want to mirror the Mozilla FTP site. Do
I need to do anything with regard to U.S. encryption export
controls?</b>

<p>No, you do not. As long as you are simply mirroring the Mozilla
site as is, you do not need to provide any notification to the Bureau
of Export Administration or NSA. If you are outside the U.S. you do
not need to provide such notification in any case, but you may need to
take other actions to comply with laws and regulations in your own
country concerning encryption technologies.

<p>As a mirror of the Mozilla FTP site you will automatically be
distributing open source encryption code as well. If you are a
U.S. resident and/or your mirror site is in the U.S. then you are
required to comply with applicable U.S. regulations governing the
export of encryption software. Your particular obligations depend on
your exact circumstances, and we cannot provide legal advice to you.

<p>However, in an advisory opinion issued in reference to the
Bernstein case, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) has stated
the following: "Concerning the posting onto a mirror or archive site
of already-posted source code, notification is required only for the
initial posting." BXA and NSA have already been notified of the
posting of encryption-related source code on the Mozilla site, and in
light of this opinion we have therefore decided <em>not</em> to ask
mirror sites to provide notification themselves.

<p>Note that in any case the notification procedures outlined in the
Export Administration Regulations apply only to U.S. residents and
sites located in the U.S. If you are not a U.S. citizen or resident
and your mirror site is located outside the U.S. then you are not
subject to U.S. encryption export regulations; however you may be
subject to other regulations related to encryption, and are
responsible for complying with any such regulations applying in your
jurisdiction.

<p>For information on notification requirements related to the export
of open source encryption source code, see the
<a href="http://w3.access.gpo.gov/bxa/ear/ear_data.html">Export Administration Regulations</a>, in particular
<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=bxa&docid=f:740.pdf">Part 740</a>,
sections 740.13(e), "Unrestricted encryption source code", and
740.17(g), "Reporting requirements". For the statement by the Bureau of
Export Administration on notification requirements for mirror sites, see
the section "Notification Requirements" in the
<a href="http://cryptome.org/bxa-bernstein.htm">Bernstein advisory
opinion</a>
contained in the letter dated February 17, 2000, from James Lewis of
BXA to Cindy Cohn, counsel for Daniel Bernstein.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h2>Further information on U.S. export controls on encryption software</h2>

<ol>
<li><a name="3-1"></a><b>What are the relevant U.S. government laws
and regulations governing export from the U.S. of encryption
software?</b>

<p>The Export Administration Regulations, the Export Administration
Act of 1979, and related U.S. presidential executive orders address
export of encryption software from the U.S.

<p>The main U.S. government regulations governing the export from the
U.S.  of cryptographic software are the Export Administration
Regulations (EAR), also known as 15 CFR chapter VII subchapter C, or
15 CFR Parts 730-774. ("CFR" stands for "Code of Federal
Regulations.")  The Export Administration Regulations were created by
the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) and were designed primarily
to implement the requirements of the Export Administration Act of 1979
(as amended), also known as 50 USC appendices 2401-2420. ("USC" stands
for "United States Code.") The EAA was passed as temporary
legislation; however the President of the United States has
periodically issued orders to continue the EAA and EAR, exercising
authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, also
known as 50 USC 1701-1706.

<p>For more information see
<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=bxa&docid=f:730.pdf">15 CFR Part 730</a>,
section 730.2 (concerning statutory authority for the EAR),
and the document
<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=bxa&docid=f:lagauth.pdf">"Principal
Statutory Authority for the Export Administration Regulations"</a>,
which contains copies of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (as
amended), the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (as
amended), and related legislation and executive orders.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><a name="3-2"></a><b>I thought export of encryption software from
the U.S. was governed by the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations. What happened to the ITAR?</b>

<p>The ITAR still exist, but are no longer used in the context of
export control of encryption software; for this purpose they have been
replaced by the EAR.

<p>Authority for non-military encryption export was transferred from
the U.S. State Department to the U.S. Department of Commerce by
Presidential Executive Order 13026 on November 15, 1996, for
regulation under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), along
with all other export-controlled commercial products.  At that time
encryption hardware, software, and technology was transferred from
the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List (CCL) of the
EAR.

<p>For more information see the document
<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=bxa&docid=f:lagauth.pdf">"Principal
Statutory Authority for the Export Administration Regulations"</a>,
which contains a copy of Executive Order 13026.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><a name="3-3"></a><b>Haven't U.S. export controls on encryption
software already been ruled unconstitutional?</b>

<p>Yes in a specific case, but the decision may yet be
overruled. Also, the case itself may be declared moot in light of the
new U.S. encryption export regulations.

<p>For several years Professor Daniel Bernstein (currently at the
University of Illinois at Chicago) has pursued a lawsuit against the
U.S. government essentially claiming that U.S. export control
regulations on encryption software and related conduct with regard to
cryptography (e.g., "technical assistance") were
unconstitutional. (Bernstein's suit was originally directed at the
ITAR and related regulations, since at the time the suit was filed the
current Export Administration Regulations were not yet in effect with
respect to encryption software.) Bernstein claimed that the
U.S. export regulations were in essence a licensing scheme designed to
impede or prohibit certain types of speech (e.g., publishing
cryptographic source code in electronic form), and were therefore
unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the
U.S. constitution. The U.S. government claimed in return that
cryptographic software was regulated based solely on its ability to be
used to secure communications and data, and that the national security
interest in so regulating it overrode any First Amendment protections;
as the export regulations put it, "encryption software is controlled
because of its functional capacity, and not because of any
informational value of such software". The government also claimed
that publication of cryptographic software in electronic form made
such functional use easier than publication in printed form, and that
that was sufficient to justify treating the two forms differently in
the regulations.

<p>On August&nbsp;25, 1997, the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California issued a final ruling (written by Judge Marilyn
Hall Patel) that "the [U.S. government] encryption regulations are an
unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment."
The U.S. government appealed this decision to the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals, and on May&nbsp;6, 1999, the court upheld the
District Court's ruling in a 2-1 decision, with Judge Betty Fletcher
writing for the majority that the ITAR and EAR export restrictions
against encryption are an unconstitutional prior restraint of free
expression, impermissible under the First Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution.

<p>However this ruling did not settle the issue of the
constitutionality of U.S. export control regulations. The
U.S. Department of Justice has sought to appeal the decision, first to
all eleven members of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (referred to as
the court <i>en banc</i>, or full court) and then possibly to the
U.S. Supreme Court. Until the appeals process is completed the
U.S. government will continue to enforce current U.S. export
regulations.

<p>In light of the new encryption export regulations it is also
possible that the Bernstein case may be declared moot on the basis
that Professor Bernstein is now free to do what he originally
requested to do, i.e., publish his encryption source code online.
