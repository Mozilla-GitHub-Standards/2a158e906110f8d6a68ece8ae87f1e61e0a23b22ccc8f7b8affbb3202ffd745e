<H2>WinFE Module</H2>
The WinFE module is the Windows front end for Mozilla (that is, Navigator).
It was originally created using the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)
class library and the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.
<H3>

<HR WIDTH="100%"><B>How It Works</B></H3>
The WinFE module is a regular MFC Windows application, although it differs
from the standard MFC application in certain ways.

<P><B>Document Template. </B>One of the most notable ways in which the
WinFE application deviates from MFC is its document template. The WinFE
application supports a multiple single document interface (MSDI). When
the user invokes the New Navigator Window command from the File menu, the
application displays an entire new main window, with a toolbar and other
controls, not just a child window inside the base window frame.

<P><B>Message Routing. </B>The WinFE application also differs from the
standard MFC application in that most of the message (event) routing has
been heavily modified. MFC proved inadequate when Netscape introduced HTML
frameset support. We had to target the frame with a focus, which was beyond
the capability of the standard MFC <TT>WM_COMMAND</TT> message routing
system. The MFC mechanism expects a view to be owned by a frame. The view
is what Mozilla shows the HTML presentation in. We needed views that were
children of views instead of frames. We changed the message routing so
that messages are directed to the frame with the current focus.

<P><B>Interface to the Back End. </B>The interfaces with the back end of
Mozilla are generally common for all the front ends, although there are
some differences. There's a file in the Windows front end called <TT>cfe.cpp</TT>.
There are a lot of functions with <TT>CFE</TT> in their names; those functions
fill in a table of function pointers from the header file <TT>mk_cx_fn.h</TT>.
That header file contains the interface through which most of the back
end communicates with the front end. The <TT>CFE</TT> functions are the
functions whose pointers fill in that table. When a <TT>CFE</TT> function
is called, it takes a pointer to the <TT>MWContext</TT> structure and converts
it to a C++ object. Then it calls the particular virtual function through
the converted C++ object.

<P><B>MWContext.</B> <TT>MWContext</TT> is a C struct with a bunch of members,
many of which deal with the loading of a URL. The letter "MW" stand for
"Mozilla Window." <TT>MWContext</TT> contains the current language identifier
of the document and other miscellaneous information. It is the container
of the <TT>mk_cx_fn.h</TT> function table and some state data. It's largely
known as evil, and we try our best not to invent anything new by expanding
the <TT>MWContext</TT>. By now <TT>MWContext</TT> has been extended so
much that it's difficult to separate the various components of the Mozilla
(modularity) without reworking a lot of code. <TT>MWContext</TT> structures
are created whenever a new window is created. In addition, there are two
hidden <TT>MWContext</TT> structures used for background URL loading when
it's not user invoked. <TT>MWContext</TT> structures can load multiple
URLs at a time, and the actions you take on one <TT>MWContext</TT> will
not effect a different <TT>MWContext</TT>. If the user presses the stop
button in a browser window, we don't want to quit loading URLs in a different
<TT>MWContext</TT>.

<P><B>Loading a URL. </B>The following diagram shows the inheritance hierarchy
of key classes which load content from a given URL and process the data
for display or other purposes in the Windows front end. Other platforms
will differ greatly.&nbsp;<IMG SRC="diagrama.gif" >

<P>Given any <TT>CStubsCX</TT> instance, you can load a URL. It won't do
anything except perhaps go into the cache. Derived from <TT>CStubsCX</TT>
is the great behemoth, <TT>CDCCX</TT>. The operative letters in the name
are <TT>DC</TT>, a Windows term. <TT>DC</TT> refers to the device context
through which you draw, so if you need to create any type of drawing to
a new device, you derive from <TT>CDCCX</TT>. Also, CDCCX is the easiest
place to implement drawing code, because the print engine and the window
display engine automatically benefit. The other letters in this and the
other class names in this section are the initial <TT>C</TT> which stands
for "class," and the trailing <TT>CX</TT> which indicates that the class
implements the interface for an <TT>MWContext</TT> structure.

<P><TT>CPrintCX</TT> does printing. The <TT>CPaneCX</TT> refers to a window
pane. It's halfway implemented. This is an opportunity for future development
if someone would take <TT>CPaneCX</TT> make it actually work. The goal
was to have no MFC knowledge inside the class <TT>CPaneCX</TT>. <TT>CPaneCX</TT>
knows how to draw to a window on the screen. <TT>CWinCX</TT> is the same
thing, except that it has more implmentation; it knows all the details
of MFC and calls into it a lot. However, a certain amount of the implementation
could be moved into <TT>CPaneCX</TT>, as a good future direction, and eventually
<TT>CWinCX</TT> could die. It would eliminate one dependency on MFC and
probably go a lot faster as well.

<P><TT>CMetafileCX</TT> is used with the OLE server. A Mozilla document
can be embedded into an OLE application. When it's active, Mozilla draws
into <TT>CWinCX</TT>. When inactive, OLE requires that it draw into a metafile,
represented in Mozilla by <TT>CMetafileCX</TT>. However, the implementation
has flaws and may not work well. The <TT>CNetworkCX</TT> doesn't do any
display. It works with an OLE automation client. Its purpose is to load
the document data from a URL and provide the data back to the external
application. <TT>CSaveCX</TT> doesn't do any display but it displays a
progress dialog. It's used when Mozilla saves a file to disk or displays
to an external viewer.

<P>The exit code of the application is very confusing. Every <TT>MWContext</TT>
structure that exists places a type of lock on the application so that
it cannot exit. If even one browser window is open Mozilla can't exit until
the user closes the window. Or, for example, if the user saves a large
file, Mozilla won't exit until the file has finished being saved. The algorithm
for exiting is: count the number of <TT>MWContext</TT> structs; if number
equals 2 (the number of hidden <TT>MWContext</TT> structures described
previously), then exit.
<H3>

<HR WIDTH="100%"><B>Where It's Headed</B></H3>
We would like to remove the dependency on MFC, primarily for speed and
size considerations, but also to enable access to compilers that don't
support MFC. We would prefer not to be required to ship the extra libraries
whenever we ship a product. We don't think any Netscape internal effort
will push in that direction any time soon, but we believe the free source
community may desire this strongly.

<P>Another direction for future development is the implementation of Aurora
capabilities in the Windows front end. Aurora is a Communicator client
effort that implements the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which
is represented in XML, to facilitate categorization and manipulation of
information.

<P>RDF promises to facilitate everything from accessing your local file
stem to up and downloading using FTP, history, bookmarks, site maps, and
search results. It can also improve handling of mail and news by providing
a hierarchy information instead of just the messages themselves. For example,
you could more easily save a message as a file or upload a local file to
an FTP server. The goal is to enable someone to integrate whatever they
want, add support for whole new types of data or new kinds of servers.
RDF technology makes available information about the relationships between
various units of data. For example, you could read the player information
or server statistics on a Quake server and find out how many people had
been killed, get a list of current players and how long they'd been playing.
You'd never have to leave your own locale to do that. Also, servers can
serve up site maps of their sites, providing an organized structure of
their links that you could use to browse the site more easily. For example,
new data could appear in a different colored icon. More information about
RDF is available at <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">http://www.w3.org/RDF/</A>.

<P>Any new services added to Mozilla will probably be delivered using RDF
technology. If someone's going to develop new features, especially involving
a hierarchical display of information, then if they use RDF it will be
more easily integrated into Mozilla. The goal of RDF is to integrate all
the different displays of hierarchical information into a common format
and interface.
