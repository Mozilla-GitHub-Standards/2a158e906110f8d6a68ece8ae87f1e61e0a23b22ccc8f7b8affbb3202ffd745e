 <h1>Mozilla at One: A Look Back and Ahead</h1>
 <p><a href="mailto:hecker@netscape.com">Frank Hecker</a>,
  02-<abbr title="April">Apr</abbr>-1999
 <p>Now that mozilla.org and the open-source Mozilla project are a year
  old, it's an appropriate time to look back at the experience thus far:
  what has been accomplished, what has not yet been done, what might
  have been done differently, what lessons have been learned, and what
  issues lie ahead. Below you'll find my personal opinions concerning these
  topics.
 <h2>Highlights</h2>
 <p>Here are what I think are the major highlights of the last year,
  things that worked out relatively well and constituted progress toward
  the goals of mozilla.org and the Mozilla project:
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>Netscape and mozilla.org released a large body of code into the open-source
    "pool," including
   <ul>
    <li><a href="source.html">source code for Mozilla</a>
     itself, consisting of most of the code-in-progress for Netscape Communicator
     5.0
    <li>source code for related software, including the
     <a href="directory/">Directory <abbr>SDK</abbr>s</a> for
     <a href="directory/csdk.html">C</a> and
     <a href="directory/javasdk.html">Java</a>,
     <a href="directory/perldap.html">PerLDAP</a>,
     the Communicator
     <a href="projects/cck/">Client Customization Kit</a>,
     and a
     <a href="js/">JavaScript reference implementation</a>
    <li>several development tools useful for open-source projects, including the
     <a href="bugs/">Bugzilla</a> bug tracking system
     (now also <a href="http://developer.redhat.com/bugzilla/">used by Red Hat
     Software</a>, among others), the <a href="bonsai.html">Bonsai</a>
     system for monitoring CVS trees, and the <a href="tinderbox.html">Tinderbox</a>
     build system
    <li>source code for "orphaned" technology no longer under active development
     by Netscape, including the <a href="projects/ef/">Electrical
     Fire</a> Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementation and the Java-based <a href="projects/grendel/">Grendel</a>
     mail/news client (thus ensuring that others might benefit from the code already
     created)
   </ul>
  <li>Netscape and mozilla.org created the
   <a href="MPL/NPL-1.0.html">Netscape Public License</a>
   (<abbr>NPL</abbr>) and the
   <a href="MPL/MPL-1.0.html">Mozilla Public License</a>
   (<abbr>MPL</abbr>) for <a href="MPL/">licensing
   the Mozilla source release</a> and other code released by
   Netscape. The licenses were created through a relatively public
   process in which draft licenses were published and comments solicited;
   partly as a result, the final <abbr>NPL</abbr> and <abbr>MPL</abbr> 1.0 were accepted by the
   bulk of open-source developers as reasonable licenses balancing the
   interests of Netscape and the larger community of developers and
   users. The <abbr>NPL</abbr> and <abbr>MPL</abbr> have also influenced new licenses created for
   other open-source projects. Note also that the <abbr>NPL</abbr> and <abbr>MPL</abbr> have recently been
   revised to address concerns about their patent clauses; see the
   <a href="MPL/NPL-1.0M.html">revised licenses</a>
   for more information.
   (The revised licenses also allow for the possibility of licensing code under
   both the <abbr>NPL</abbr>/<abbr>MPL</abbr> and an alternate license such as the <abbr>GPL</abbr>;
   mozilla.org will use this to release the JavaScript
   reference implementation under dual licenses so it can be used
   by more projects. There are no plans to release Mozilla code this way.)
  <li>Early "developer preview" releases of <a href="binaries.html">Mozilla
   binaries</a> (including the recently-released "<a href="projects/seamonkey/release-notes/"><abbr>M3</abbr>
   version</a>") have provided a "plausible promise" of a fast, cross-platform,
   <a href="newlayout/faq.html#Which open standards">standards-compliant</a>
   web browser (as well as a <a href="mailnews/">mail/news
   client</a> and <a href="editor/"><abbr>HTML</abbr> editor</a>)
   with relatively small memory and disk footprints, that can be <a href="newlayout/doc/webwidget.html">embedded</a>
   in other applications and cleanly extended to incorporate new <a href="projects/xpcom/">modules</a>,
   modified <a href="xpfe/">user interfaces</a>, third-party
   <a href="oji/">Java implementations</a>, and new
   local and network <a href="rdf/doc/">data sources</a>.
  <li>The project has begun to attract major pieces of useful functionality
   developed by outside contributors, such as the <a href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html">expat
   <abbr>XML</abbr> parser</a> (from <a href="mailto:jjc@jclark.com">James Clark</a>) and
   the <a href="http://www.iol.ie/~locka/mozilla/mozilla.htm">Mozilla ActiveX
   control</a> (from <a href="mailto:locka@iol.ie">Adam Lock</a>).
  <li>The first non-Netscape commercial product built on the Mozilla code base
   has been announced: <a href="http://www.doczilla.com/">DocZilla</a>, a
   tool for accessing <abbr>SGML</abbr> documents (and <abbr>XML</abbr> and <abbr>HTML</abbr> documents as well).
  <li>Netscape and mozilla.org have to a large degree opened up not just the
   Mozilla code itself but also previously internal-only design <a href="community.html">discussions</a>
   about how to move it forward -- an important achievement in terms of proving
   the workability of the open-source development model at commercial software
   companies that have previously developed only proprietary software. Those
   who don't have time to read all the newsgroup discussions can also keep
   track of happenings in the Mozilla project by reading <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/">mozillaZine</a>,
   an independent news site created by <a href="mailto:chrisn@statecollege.com">Chris
   Nelson</a> to provide information on all things Mozilla-related,
   as well as the Mozilla
   <a href="newsbot/">newsbot</a>, which highlights significant threads in the Mozilla
   newsgroups;
   there are also many third-party web sites that have sprung up around the Mozilla
   project.
  <li>mozilla.org has been able to move Mozilla to being based more on
   other open-source code, as opposed to depending on proprietary
   technology for key functions. In particular the Mozilla project was
   able to leverage the work of the
   <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+ project</a>
   to provide underlying technology for the new Mozilla
   <a href="xpfe/">cross-platform front-end interface</a>.
  <li>Several independent efforts have started to <a href="ports/">port
   Mozilla</a> to other platforms, with some of them now well along (for example,
   the <a href="ports/os2/">OS/2 port</a> created by
   <a href="mailto:mjf35@cam.ac.uk">John Fairhurst</a>, <a href="mailto:sobotka@axess.com">Henry
   Sobotka</a>, and others).
 </ul>
 <h2>Lowlights and Debatable Decisions</h2>
 <p>All has not been sweetness and light, however. The first (and by far
  most important) "lowlight" is of course that the Mozilla
  project has not yet resulted in a production release of Netscape
  Communicator 5.0, or even an official public beta release of
  Communicator. Were there any ways things could have been done
  differently? Here are two possibilities (if nothing more) and
  some of the thoughts and debates around them:
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>Netscape and mozilla.org could have proceeded on the original plan
    to release "Mozilla Classic," i.e., a version of Mozilla using the
    original Communicator 5.0 source code, instead of <a
    href="roadmap.html">rewriting Mozilla</a> using
    the new NGLayout <abbr>HTML</abbr> layout engine (a major component of the new
    Gecko technology). This might have produced an official 5.0 release
    sooner and (as a side effect) resulted in having much earlier a
    relatively stable code base buildable by more developers; however this
    would have been at the cost of having a level of standards compliance
    not much above that of the Communicator 4.x releases. Many web
    developers, including those associated with the
    <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a>,
    expressed the <a href="http://archive.webstandards.org/ng.txt">strong
    opinion</a> that Netscape should not release a 5.0 product without
    complete compliance with as many web standards as possible, including
    at a minimum <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4.0 and <abbr>CSS1</abbr>. Netscape and mozilla.org therefore
    decided to drop the existing layout code and
    instead use NGLayout, even though at the time NGLayout was quite a
    ways from final release, and thus the overall Communicator 5.0
    schedule would slip at least a few months (especially given that many
    other parts of Mozilla would have to be rewritten to use the new
    NGLayout <abbr>API</abbr>s).
   <p>Would it have been possible to first do a Mozilla Classic-based
    Communicator 5.0 release and then develop a Gecko-based follow-on
    release (5.x or 6.0) in the same overall time it will end up taking to
    do a Gecko-based Communicator 5.0? It's impossible to know for sure;
    however such a plan would have arguably created real and significant
    risks in terms of the length of the development schedule and the
    complexity of the development process, especially if the two releases
    were developed in parallel or nearly so.
  <li>Netscape could have skipped development work on the Communicator
   4.5 release (created using the traditional internal-only development
   process, with proprietary source code) and gone straight for 5.0; this
   would have freed up many of the developers (especially mail/news
   developers) who were working on 4.5 and allowed them to contribute
   much earlier to the Mozilla/5.0 effort.  This problem was an unfortunate consequence
   of the fact that the 5.0 release was not complete and working at the time it was
   originally made available through mozilla.org, so that the Mozilla project was
   initially dependent on the activities of 
   Netscape developers to produce a complete release.  This led to a situation
   where there was a possible conflict between Netscape's business
   priorities as a commercial software company and mozilla.org's
   priorities as coordinator of an open-source project.
   However, putting aside for a moment
   Netscape's market needs for a 4.5 release, would it have helped the
   Mozilla schedule that much to have the 4.5 developers working on
   Mozilla and 5.0 instead? Or were there other items (like NGLayout)
   gating the Mozilla/5.0 schedule? Space and time don't permit
   discussing here all of the complexities of this issue.
 </ul>
 <p>Another perceived lowlight has been the pace at which 
  outside developers have been attracted to work on Mozilla project.
  To some extent the issue here is people's expectations; it's unclear whether the
  number of outside Mozilla developers is that small relative to other
  open-source projects of comparable complexity and at equally early
  points in their development. The fact that Communicator development
  had been going on for four years prior to release of the source is
  arguably irrelevant, since any developers outside Netscape had to
  start from scratch on 1 April 1998 in terms of their Mozilla learning
  curve. In any case, here are some of the ideas that have been
  advanced as to why thousands of people are not currently hacking on
  Mozilla (in the sense of contributing new code):
 <ul>
  <li>There was, at least initially, a very steep learning curve for
   developers wishing to do
   serious Mozilla hacking. There is a lot of code in terms of number of
   lines and number of source files, the code is very complex, being a
   mix of C and C++ with additional things like JavaScript thrown in for
   good measure, and there was not very much introductory documentation
   to orient new developers, at least at the start. The situation with
   regards to introductory documentation is somewhat better now; in
   particular the
   <a href="http://www.doczilla.com/development/index.html">tutorial on
   extending Mozilla</a> by
   <a href="mailto:jst@citec.fi">Johnny Stenb&auml;ck</a> and
   <a href="mailto:hto@citec.fi">Heikki Toivonen</a>
   provides a good introduction to the complete novice.
  <li>For much of the project's life Mozilla has been very hard to build
   from scratch, especially for new developers with no previous build
   experience at Netscape.  The build system has often been in flux, was
   not well-documented, and is pretty complex. On the plus side, the new
   <a href="projects/autoconf/">autoconf-based
   build system</a> (contributed by
   <a href="mailto:cls@seawood.org">Christopher Seawood</a>) brings the
   Mozilla project much more in line with current practice for
   open-source projects developing on Linux, and it is now significantly
   easier for new developers to get working builds on the
   <a href="build/unix.html">Linux/Unix</a>,
   <a href="build/win32.html">Microsoft Windows</a>,
   and <a href="build/mac.html">Apple Macintosh
   PowerPC</a> platforms.
  <li>The Mozilla code base has been in continual flux and as a result builds
   on any given day have had wildly varying levels of stability. Because many
   of the technologies used in the current Mozilla architecture (for example,
   <a href="projects/xpcom/">XPCOM</a> and XPToolkit)
   are still in active development and because of the difficulty of doing
   truly portable cross-platform code, there have been relatively few stable
   points thus far at which Mozilla both builds and runs on all the major platforms
   of interest (Win32, Linux, and Mac). Like ease of building, stability is also
   improving slowly but surely as newer "milestone" releases appear, like
   the most recent "M3" release.
  <li>For a while there was little (and in some cases no) documentation
   for the underlying Mozilla architecture and implementation details,
   and much of the documentation that did exist was either obsolete or
   badly out of date. This situation is improving, as most if not all of
   the major Mozilla areas now have at least some internal documentation;
   however the documentation will not be able to stabilize until the
   underlying implementations stabilize.
  <li>Netscape did not make the Mozilla code available under the
   <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
   License</a>, and based on the terms of the GPL code licensed under the
   <abbr>NPL</abbr> or <abbr>MPL</abbr> could not be incorporated into a <abbr>GPL</abbr>ed program. (The
   reverse was and is true as well: <abbr>GPL</abbr>ed code cannot be incorporated
   into Mozilla.) As a result Mozilla code could not be used in free
   software projects like <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> that
   were incorporating browser functionality but were using the <abbr>GPL</abbr> for
   all their code. These inconsistencies between the
   <abbr>NPL</abbr>/<abbr>MPL</abbr> and the <abbr>GPL</abbr> have
   yet to be fully resolved.
  <li>
   <p>Many people have the perception that Mozilla is still a "Netscape
    project" and that therefore "outside" support is not needed nor even
    wanted. This is an incorrect perception, but it's understandable why people
    might have become confused about this: First, Netscape and
    now <abbr>AOL</abbr> do have a significant business interest in having the
    Mozilla project be successful, in order to provide a sound technology
    base from which to develop the branded Netscape Communicator product
    as well as to leverage for other possible AOL software and services;
    thus Netscape has funded and AOL will continue to fund a large number
    of Mozilla developers by providing them full-time employment. Mozilla developers
    outside Netscape who are volunteers do not have the luxury of being
    able to work on Mozilla full-time, and therefore until more companies
    are funding Mozilla development it's possible that significant Mozilla
    development will continue to be done mostly by Netscape developers.
    Unfortunately the issue of Netscape
    "dominating" Mozilla will likely remain to some extent a "no-win"
    situation as far as AOL and Netscape are concerned. If AOL puts even
    more funding and people into Mozilla development then it is open to
    the charge that it is trying to dominate the project and direct it
    solely to commercial ends; on the other hand if it were to back away
    from direct support of Mozilla and rely much more on outside
    developers then people would think that AOL had abandoned Mozilla or
    was guilty of exploiting the work of volunteers for its own purposes
    without giving anything back to the project. This problem is not
    unique to <abbr>AOL</abbr> and Netscape, of course; similar tensions will be
    present as other commercial companies move more into support, development,
    and use of open-source software.
   <p>Also, there has been a learning curve for Netscape developers themselves, in
    terms of becoming comfortable and then competent at the task of doing
    development "in the fishbowl," i.e., with all design discussions, code
    checkins, and debugging conducted in the open; some of their actions
    during this learning period (for example, not posting design proposals
    for comment, or conducting discussions on Netscape-internal forums as
    opposed to using public newsgroups and mailing lists) have contributed to
    the perception that Mozilla is still a Netscape-only project.
    Fortunately Netscape developers have for the most part learned
    their open-source lessons and are now doing a better job of working
    within a public project.
 </ul>
 <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
 <p>Everyone will take their own lessons away from the Mozilla experience;
  here are some I think should be kept in mind:
 <ul>
  <li><strong>There's a lot more to a project than writing code.</strong> People
   tend to focus on the number of people contributing code to Mozilla or
   having access to the <abbr>CVS</abbr> tree; however the complete list of people
   helping mozilla.org includes not just
   <a href="owners.html">module owners</a> and other
   contributors of code but also people
   <a href="quality/">testing early builds</a> and
   <a href="quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html">submitting
   bug reports</a>, as well as people critiquing design decisions
   relating to proposed feature sets, user interfaces, internal
   implementations, and public <abbr>API</abbr>s. Not all of those people are
   necessarily going to be programmers, and of those who are programmers
   not all are going to be contributing code. For example, several
   developers have been testing the Mozilla code for use as an <abbr>HTML</abbr>
   layout engine embedded in their application. They are not
   changing or contributing to that code, but their advice and bug
   reports help improve the code.
  <li><strong>Quality is better than quantity.</strong> Rather than having a
   mass of relatively unskilled volunteers, it is better to have the help
   of a few people who really know what they're doing in a particular
   area. Judged against this criterion, the mozilla.org effort has
   been very successful in attracting the support of several very
   talented non-Netscape people, both as programmers and as informal
   consultants. To take one major example, many of the world's
   leading experts on Web standards (<abbr>HTML</abbr> 4.0,
   <abbr>CSS</abbr>, <abbr>XML</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>) have
   contributed valuable advice and feedback on the implementation of
   those standards in Mozilla; their help is a key reason why even in its
   current immature state the Mozilla code is more standards-compliant
   than any other browser available today.
  <li>To quote a hoary proverb, <q><strong>An ounce of prevention is worth a
   pound of cure.</strong></q> Traditionally Netscape did design
   internally, produced internal alpha builds, and then released a public
   beta, at which point the public was finally able to critique the
   product and suggest improvements. Unfortunately, in many cases it was
   too late at that point to make widely requested improvements, because
   the developers
   had already committed to a particular implementation design and the
   product marketing folks were bound and determined to prevent them from
   going back and starting over; otherwise the product would have never
   shipped anywhere close to its projected release dates. Working in an
   open-source mode has allowed Netscape to get useful feedback right up
   front, in many cases before any code has been written, and change
   plans according; such feedback has not only helped Netscape make
   smarter decisions, it also (and even more important) has kept us from
   making dumb ones. (A good example here was the decision to rearchitect
   the product rather then try to struggle on using the old code
   base.)
  <li><strong>There is no
   <a href="http://mathserv.math.sfu.ca/History_of_Math/Europe/Euclid300BC/euclidmain.html">"royal
   road"</a> to open source for commercial software companies.</strong> To
   quote <a href="mailto:jwz@jwz.org">Jamie Zawinski</a>, you can't
   <q>sprinkle [a project] with the magic pixie dust of "open source," and
   have everything magically work.</q> To elaborate, a company cannot simply
   release source code, put a few newsgroups up, and expect distributed
   development to magically self-organize; it will need to make a
   sustained effort requiring various people's time and attention in
   order to get a distributed open-source development effort to the point
   where it can produce results. In Netscape's case this effort did
   not end with the release of the source code on 31 March 1998; on the
   contrary, it has been a continuing project to get
   people used to "working in the fishbowl:" reading and participating in
   the <a href="community.html">Mozilla
   newsgroups</a>, <em>not</em> using Netscape-internal lists for
   discussions that aren't in fact confidential, writing and publishing
   documentation and proposals for the benefit of those not in their
   immediate groups, and so on. I'm not talking just about developers
   either; the effects of open-source development are spreading (or will
   spread) outward in the corporation to also include quality assurance,
   technical support, product marketing, and related functions.
  <li>In relation to the previous point, <strong>it takes time to get a project ramped up
   to full activity</strong>, especially with regard to attracting large numbers of
   participants outside the original group. For much of the past year the Mozilla
   developers and mozilla.org have been working to address the core design and
   implementation issues around the Mozilla code itself, as well as the mechanics of
   converting an internal proprietary development project into a public open-source
   project. Now that that groundwork has been laid more attention can be paid to
   other areas where work is needed, like Mozilla testing by end users, more polished
   releases in terms of installation and initial configuration, and so on.
 </ul>
 <h2>Issues Going Forward</h2>
 <p>That the past is past is a given; we can't change the effects of
  decisions already made and things already done. However there are
  several issues outstanding today that may affect the future success of
  the Mozilla project, and they're worth touching on here (with some
  suggested forums for followup discussion):
 <dl>
  <dt>Mozilla on small devices.
  <dd>There is much excitement in the
   press and elsewhere over the prospects for non-PC devices. Is the
   Mozilla architecture as currently implemented capable of being
   scaled down for truly small devices (e.g., PDAs, settop devices, cell
   phones, and similar "information appliances")?  Are there possible
   design changes we should be looking at now in order to help
   make this easier? Or are outside developers going to be okay if
   they simply proceed using the current code base? (There's a new
   Mozilla newsgroup
   <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.small-devices">netscape.public.mozilla.small-devices</a>
   for discussing these issues.)
  <dt>Recruiting more developers.
  <dd>What further steps need to be
   taken to make it as pain-free as possible for developers to hack
   Mozilla? The existing <a href="build/">build
   instructions</a>, project
   <a href="docs/">documentation</a>,
   and <a href="http://www.doczilla.com/development/index.html">Mozilla
   tutorial</a> are good steps in this direction; do they need further
   supplementing? If so, what are the most important documents to create
   or improve? (A suggested forum is
   <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.documentation">netscape.public.mozilla.documentation</a>.)
   What about providing more stable releases and buildable versions: will
   the current
   <a href="projects/seamonkey/milestones/">milestone
   plan</a> address this problem? (A suggested forum is
   <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.general">netscape.public.mozilla.general</a>.)
  <dt>Security and cryptographic code.
  <dd>As is well-known, the
   <a href="crypto-faq.html">Mozilla security and
   crypto code</a> was removed prior to release because of <abbr>U.S.</abbr> export
   control regulations. Unfortunately both U.S. export control
   regulations and the presence of third-party technology continue to prevent
   <abbr>AOL</abbr>/Netscape from releasing a complete <abbr>SSL</abbr> and S/MIME implementation
   for Mozilla. It would in theory be possible for AOL to release a
   limited set of security source code, but this code could only be used by developers
   in the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> and Canada, and would also require additional work and time to add
   implementations of all the cryptographic algorithms required, some of
   which are still subject to <abbr>U.S.</abbr> patents. Given these limitations, it's
   unclear that doing such a limited security source release would serve any
   useful purpose with regard to either AOL or the broader Mozilla
   project; however as time goes on this may change. (A suggested forum is
   <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.crypto">netscape.public.mozilla.crypto</a>.)
  <dt>Increasing corporate involvement in Mozilla development.
  <dd>Usually people think of Mozilla developers as being either Netscape employees or
   volunteers on the net. However as noted previously one commercial
   company has already announced a product based on Mozilla code, and several
   others are now involved in Mozilla development to one degree or
   another. The core
   <a href="mission.html">mission</a>
   of mozilla.org will continue to be to coordinate public Mozilla development and
   be the steward of the public source tree; however that mission will include
   not just working with net developers but also working with commercial companies
   that wish to contribute code to the project and use Mozilla technologies in their
   own products and services. Are there any things that mozilla.org could do to work
   better with commercial companies while pursuing the core goals of the Mozilla project?
   Are there things that mozilla.org could do to help net developers who want to do paid
   Mozilla development work (e.g., as independent consultants or as employees of
   other companies)?
   (A suggested forum is
   <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.general">netscape.public.mozilla.general</a>.)
 </dl>
 <p>Finally, there are always the issues of what will happen with the
  Mozilla project now that the AOL/Netscape merger has been concluded,
  and when <abbr>AOL</abbr> will fulfill the goal of shipping a branded Netscape
  Communicator 5.0 release incorporating the Mozilla technology. Concerning
  support of the Mozilla project, we have the
  <a href="stevecase.html">expressions of
  support</a> for Mozilla and mozilla.org by Steve Case and other AOL
  executives, combined with the rational expectation that AOL would not
  have acquired and be funding development efforts that it doesn't have
  any use for. As for release of Communicator 5.0, anyone who wishes
  will be able to track the progress of Mozilla development literally on
  a day-to-day basis, whether it being monitoring
  <a href="http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?module=SeaMonkeyAll&amp;branch=HEAD&amp;branchtype=match&amp;dir=&amp;file=&amp;filetype=match&amp;who=&amp;whotype=match&amp;sortby=Date&amp;hours=2&amp;date=day&amp;mindate=&amp;maxdate=&amp;cvsroot=%2Fcvsroot">code
  check-ins</a>,
  checking on
  <a href="http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=SeaMonkey&amp;hours=12">build
  results</a> across platforms, or testing
  <a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/">nightly builds</a>;
  you'll know almost as much about how things are going as we will.
 <p>The Mozilla project goes beyond just AOL and Netscape though; as
  many people have commented, "the code is out there" now and in a sense
  belongs to everyone. As such its prospects can be improved not just by
  the work of AOL and Netscape, but by the help of anyone who sees its
  value and wants to
  <a href="get-involved.html">get involved</a>. We
  look forward to working with all of you.
