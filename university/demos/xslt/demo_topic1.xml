<title>XSLT Overview</title>

<p>XSLT is the transformation part of the Extensible Style
Language (XSL). It is an XML language for transforming XML documents (into
something else).</p>

<p>Mozilla has excellent and nearly complete support for XSLT by way
of the Transformix extension, which started outside of Mozilla but has
gradually become more intregral to the browser, particularly as XSLT
has emerged as a hot standard and developers have begun to use Mozilla
as a transformation platform.</p>

<p>XSLT stylesheets can transform XML arbitrarily with a system of
recursive matching rules (using XPath) and templates applied to those
matches. In this demo, we use a small set of rules and a method in the
XSLT language, document(), to aggregate a list of XML "topics" into a
single HTML document for display.</p>

<p>The XSLT function that drives this demo is document(), described in the section below.</p>
