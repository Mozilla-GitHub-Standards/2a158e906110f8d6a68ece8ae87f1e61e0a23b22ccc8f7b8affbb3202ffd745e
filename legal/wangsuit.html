Individuals and companies holding software patents may assert that software
code violates their patent rights. Sometimes these assertions are
well founded. 
In other cases, however, such assertions are without
merit, either because the patent is invalid (for example, because it was
invented by someone else and/or disclosed in publications --prior art--
before the date of the alleged invention) or because patent holders contend
their patents cover software which was not part of the original invention,
if any, and try to impermissably extend the scope of the claims.
This behavior is an abuse of the patent system and a drag on software 
development.
It will be incumbent upon the development community to squash invalid patents
and help ensure that patent claims are enforced only to the extent that
they are valid and reflect the actual scope of the invention. In many cases,
we know the patent is invalid based on prior art we find, but we believe
there is even more invalidating prior art we don't find, but which is well
known in the development community. Please review the information below,
and if you know of relevant prior art, report it.

Wang is asserting that a
<A HREF="http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?patent_number=4751669">
patent</A> 
that it holds for a video text system is infringed by the Netscape
browser. Netscape is vigorously defending the lawsuit.  Wang contends
the patent discloses the invention of: 
<UL>
<LI>Saving web pages retrieved from
a server using "Save As" (See Claim 23, 24),  
<LI>Bookmarks (Claims 20-22), 
<LI>Saving files with file extensions and then retrieving the
pages and decoding the files based on the file extension (Claim 38). 
</UL>
The
patent was filed in 1984. We believe the patent is noninfringed, 
unenforceable,
and invalid based on, among other things, prior art such as the Alto &amp;
Star computers from Xerox Parc, Terminal Emulators,  connectivity
software prevelant in the the early 80s such as  CrossTalk, Unix
symbolic links (ln -s), and various other "video text" systems like
Telidon, Prestel, Mupid used in the late 70s, early 80s.
<P>
It's easy to say "of course that's invalid", but what is required are
specific references to prior art. If you know of additional prior art 
publications,
software programs, books, or systems in existence --prior to March 30,
1983-- which disclose and/or describe the claimed elements send us a message.
