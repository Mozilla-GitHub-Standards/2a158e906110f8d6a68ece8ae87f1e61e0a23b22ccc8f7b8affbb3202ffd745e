<P>
On May 6, 
Leonie Brinkema,
District Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia,
dismissed all patent claims raised by Wang 
against Netscape and AOL.

<P>
Believing that the web wasn't videotex, 
and that a videotex patent should 
only apply to videotex systems, 
Netscape brought a summary judgment motion, arguing that 
there was no need for a trial because there were 
no disputed facts and, under the applicable law, the patent
was not infringed.
The judge agreed, ruling that the videotex system covered
by the patent was "generically and fundamentally different"
from web browsers.  
In doing so, the court rejected Wang's attempt to extend 
their patent to cover web pages.
Relevant differences included
<UL>
  <LI>web pages <i>vs.</i> videotex frames
  <LI>the web <i>vs.</i> videotex central suppliers
  <LI>web server access <i>vs.</i> videotex central supplier connections
</UL>
There were other points which distinguished the web and web pages
from the patented system, but the court didn't address them
because there was no need to.

<P>
Wang may appeal.  We inside mozilla.org aren't
sure how that works.  
If anything crops up, it'll
be noted here.

<P>
Since so much of
mozilla.org's source
came from Netscape's allegedly infringing product, 
we've been keenly interested in the
case and we're pretty happy with the news  (even
though we expected it all along).

You guys blew away our lawyers.
Tons of stuff came in, and <i>good</i> stuff.
We'll get with our lead attorney 
and get some real data here.
Stay tuned if you're interested.

It's really clear that the net can be an invaluable
resource in fighting bogus claims.
Anything done to reduce abuse of IP law has got
to be good.



<H2>Some FAQs</H2>
Several requests have come in for case numbers, URLs
for the actual court filings, and related things, and
we anticipate people asking for URLs for transcripts
of the decision.  If we can get any of that, it'll get
posted here.

<B>Case No.:</B>
The case is Civil Action No. 97-1628-A
in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Virginia,
Alexandria Division.
<LI><B>Transcript:</B>
I saw a transcript of the May 6
motions hearing which ended in the dismissal
of the case.  It's 51 pages and I don't have
softcopy.  Largely, it referes to arguments
previously presented, and spends some time referring
to a Federal Circuit case referred to 
as <U>Vitronics</u> which
"is the case which guides the Court's analysis in
construing the terms of the patent...."
They talked about Prestel, NAPLPS and SCEPTRE.
Plenty of further motions were dismissed as moot,
without reference to their validity; the Court said that
deciding moot issues wasn't a good use of judicial
resources.
<P>
The Order is only a page and a half.  I'm pretty sure
I can get that OCRed; stay tuned.
